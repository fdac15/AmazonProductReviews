"When these arrived in the mail, the first thing I did was look them over. They are an interesting microfiber material that feels a lot different from our current dish towels. I washed them and looked at them to see if there were any pulls or snags. There were none.The color is attractive (sage), depending on your decorating scheme. They are very absorbent and work well for the desired purpose….to dry hands and dishes, as well as the occasional counter top.My only complaint would be that they sort of puckered around the edges when they were washed. That makes them hang a little funny, but isn't a deal breakier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247LFEAL2DGXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WOJLRO#wasThisHelpful","R247LFEAL2DGXB","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When these arrived in the mail, the first thing I did was look them over. They are a little thinner material than our previous cloths, but they appeared well made and had a attractive color (spice) and pattern.I washed them and they are now in service in our kitchen, where they are used to wipe up spills and rinse off dishes. They work well and still look good. There are no pulled threads or unraveling in any of the cloths.

"I want to start by saying that I have no interest in entering the swinging lifestyle. The thought of getting naked and performing in front of two, three or a room full of people not only intimidates me, but frankly, terrifies me. That said, I found the book to be somewhat interesting, and I suppose it might be helpful f you are looking to enter that lifestyle.The first thing I noticed was that the author seems to have quite the sexual appetite. That, or he was stretching the truth way out of proportion. When you start to miss work to get it on…well, that is going too far. In addition, the author seems quite proud of being a single male that got invited to join various groups. Apparently that is difficult to accomplish. And he does not let the reader forget it, either.The book is somewhat simplistic in the writing, and the author would do well to hold onto a day job. It also is repetitive, with the same advice and information being repeated in almost every chapter. If you are interested in getting into the lifestyle, this may offer some useful tips, but as a general curiosity read it falls flat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QCPLZJQNFIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476732531#wasThisHelpful","R18QCPLZJQNFIX","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first attracted to this watch by the simplicity of the  face on the watch. Many of my watches are either tachometers or just have rather fancy faces, and that makes them difficult to read when it is hard to take your eyes off the task you are accomplishing, especially driving. I was looking for a dressy style that had a plain face  for just such times.This watch fits the bill perfectly. There isn't even a date window. Just a plain analog face that is easy to read, even with a quick glance. In addition, the watch has the size and heft of a watch that costs way more than this does. Size wise, the case of the watch is about 1 3/4 inches wide in most areas and it goes over 2 inches across where the crown extends out. The band measures in at a nice 3/4 inch in width. The weight of the watch is about 6.5 ounces.So far, the watch has kept time nicely. I have only had it for several weeks, which isn't really a fair test, but my past experience with Invicta quartz watches has been good and they keep time well.This is a nice plain, yet dignified watch and a good value at the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3W3J3FC2HAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5P2VW#wasThisHelpful","RE3W3J3FC2HAS","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, the author examines the decline of the middle class and the growing influence of the top 1% of income earners. He also examines why this has happened and what the consequences have been and will be in the future if this trend is not reversed.Currently, the middle class is being squeezed out of existence by a number of factors, including the steep decline in unions and the elimination of benefits that used to mark the middle class. In addition, pay rates, when adjusted for inflation have become stagnant over the past30 or so years, even as upper management has given themselves obscene raises.  Having been a member of the middle class for years, I know I am appalled at the decline in my purchasing power as the years have passed.As the wealth accumulates at the top end, they gain more political power. Although the founding fathers envisioned a government that listened to the public, that has given way to professional politicians who only worry about getting elected to office again…which require vast amounts of money. The author did a good job of placing blame into the hands of both political parties, as both have this attitude of catering to the rich.This is an important book to read, especially as we come into the next election cycle. The only way we will change the way the country is going is by voting out those that do not listen!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV4F83YGGUW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421417405#wasThisHelpful","RV4F83YGGUW4","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are like my wife and me, you are in need of additional storage space in your kitchen. Most of the drawers are full and the counter is covered in various utensils or appliances such as a toaster, a wine storage rack, etc. So any way to increase storage in heaven sent.This unit is made of hard plastic, and has three drawers. The machine that we own fits on it nicely and the machine still feels like it is on solid footing. The unit has 3 drawers with the sides to each which hold a total of 36 K cups.Finally, the unit is 13 inches deep, 13 1/2 inches wide and 2 3/4 inches tall.I am thrilled with it and hope to use it for a number of years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNPZ4M99LDXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RLCCL6#wasThisHelpful","RFNPZ4M99LDXC","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alex Haley is best known for writing ""Roots"" and was also the author of ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"". Both books changed the way America viewed African Americans and changed the way African Americans viewed themselves. The creation of these books was, however, more difficult than anyone could have imagined.The book delves into Haley's early life and the stories he heard told on his front porch. It follows him through his enlistment in the Coast Guard and how that career led to his career in writing. Following his retirement from the Coast Guard, he took up writing full time, and that is when his life got complicated.He was a slow writer and enjoyed researching more than he did the actual writing. In addition, with an ex-wife and the IRS hounding him, he was broke most of the time, which lead him to make promises that he might or might not have been able to deliver. That led to publishers and his agent hounding him, and Haley disappearing to be able to find the peace to write.Following the publication of ""Roots"" his troubles continued when he was accused of plagiarism and of a lack of historical accuracy. We think nothing of blending history with fiction now, but at that time the combination of the two lead to numerous critics. The criticism followed him to his grave and well beyond.The book is fascinating and reveals may aspects of Haley that I had never known. It paints a much different picture of him than the one the publishers and the TV studios wanted us to see. A worthwhile read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPXKMWPU40UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279605#wasThisHelpful","RUPXKMWPU40UN","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rosemary Kennedy was the daughter that the Kennedy family kept hidden from most of the world, and if she was allowed to be seen, it was in settings where she would appear normal.  It is obvious from the book that she suffered from some sort of birth defect due to the negligence of the doctor and nurse that were attending to Rose Kennedy when she was trying to give birth to her daughter.That the family loved all their children is not in doubt. They suffered, however, from the ignorance of the time and the great fear that anyone would find out that any of the Kennedy children were ""defective"". That just would not be proper in a family that was aspiring to the social position that they wanted to attain.What seems to me to be the most tragic aspect of all of this was that they moved her from school to school in rapid order, even when they knew that she did not adjust well to changes in ritual and behavior. Had they found a school that could handle her, and left her alone to learn, she might have ended up being able to function in society. The constant movement, however, disrupted her and made it hard for any school to handle her. And, when they finally found a place where she was truly happy, in England, they removed her for fear of her getting hurt during World War 2.In the long run, however, the fate she suffered was much worse than having been exposed to the war….they cut the front of her brain out. The book goes into a good amount of detail about just how dubious the process of lobotomy was determined to be by the majority of the medical community.The book does open up a new chapter in the Kennedy family history and does not portray Rose well at all. She comes across as a social climber with little time for her disabled daughter. When she did deal with her, it appears that she believes money is the solution. A sad tale all around, but an interesting read. It does drag in places, if for no other reason than the Kennedy family uses many names multiple times, making it somewhat confusing,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JO1ZZXCYL2NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547250258#wasThisHelpful","R1JO1ZZXCYL2NM","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is the story of the author's awakening to the dangers that face our oceans and why that is important to everyday people and why they should care. It is also the story of her recovering from an injury and overcoming her fears of the ocean.The environmental story is well written and contains good information for the lay reader. Anyone with knowledge of marine science or environmental science will most likely be aware of all of the issues presented and will find little, if any new information. For the average person with little understanding, it will serve to open your eyes to the dangers face by the world's oceans.The other part of the story is the story of this author's kayak injury and how she recovers over time. To be totally honest, I really didn't care about her problems. Many people suffer injuries or illnesses that are life threatening of life changing ad don't write books about them. If it helped her heal to tell us about her dental and bowel problems, great….but I have zero interest in hearing it. It only serves to make the read longer and more tedious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANUVBC6Y62LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583949607#wasThisHelpful","R3ANUVBC6Y62LO","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would hope that it is rather obvious that I did not order these for myself and that I, therefore, am relying on my wife for the review of these panties.First, she does not frequently wear hipsters, although she did say these were more comfortable than she thought they might be. She was also worried about the size, as they were slightly larger than the size she usually wears. Her concerns on both counts proved wrong. Because of the stretch material, she found then to be a good fit and the cut was more comfortable than first thought.Her one complaint was that the elastic waste band wasn't as wide as what she was used to or what she preferred. Otherwise, they have been a comfortable and good daily panty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ANEK2S3QAPAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3Q3KSI#wasThisHelpful","R1ANEK2S3QAPAT","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a rail fan, I was looking forward to diving into this book and learning about the rail systems in other countries. I was especially interested in what the author wrote about his trip in the United States, as I have traveled extensively on Amtrak.The information contained in the book was interesting, although I cared less about the people he met than I did about the actually rail systems and the accommodations, etc. His description of the rail in India was particularly fascinating and made me wonder how it all works.I did find several errors in his description of his trip by Amtrak. First, while traveling on the Northeast Corridor he misidentifies the maker of the locomotive pulling the train, which might be understandable.  However, when he arrives in California he describes waking up in the yard in ""San Bernardino"" and then describes the trip down Cajon Pass, with the arrival in Barstow. Actually, he was awakened in Barstow and went down the pass to San Bernardino. This does call to question the accuracy of the entire book.I think it's a good read for all people interested in rail travel, but I would approach with caution. The mistakes about the US system are pretty rookie mistakes and it calls to question the veracity of the remainder of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20DNEMXHLLY54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025283#wasThisHelpful","R20DNEMXHLLY54","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes a complete tour of the workings of Rove from when he was in college up until his days in and around the White House. It examines his dirty political tricks, his manipulation of people and his desire to turn the U.S. into a permanent conservative Republican country that is essentially a one party system.I won't go into the details here, but the book is well written, well documented and points out that Rove will stop at little to obtain his dream for the operation of this country. It is as relavent today as it was when it was written, with the exception that some material is a bit dated. Anyone, however, who believes Rove is gone is sadly mistaken. He has a Super PAC and is still trying to pull the strings from behind the curtain. In fact, I would be surprised if he didn't show up for Jeb's run a the White house in 2016….out of sight but still very active.If you care about the direction the country is headed and who we might get as our next president, this book is worth the time to read and digest. I really doubt we have seen the last of Rove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262LXGBA7K1QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451694938#wasThisHelpful","R262LXGBA7K1QM","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right off the bat, the title of the book is pure genius and gives the reader an idea of the sense of humor of the author. Although an accomplished scientist and a serious researcher, the author writes it a style that can cause you to laugh about scat.The book is a overview of feces, which might better be called excrement. And while we may think of it in more modern terms, as soon as cellular life began, so too did the excretion of waste products. The author takes us on that journey, the importance of excretion to cellular life and the problems that the amount of excrement is causing in today's world.Well written and humorous, any student of biology (or anyone with a bizarre sense of humor) will enjoy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2HCKK6EBAF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=177041116X#wasThisHelpful","R3J2HCKK6EBAF5","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lewis wrote this book during the mid 1930s as a wakeup call to people about  could happen to the political process if we let our guard down. I first heard about the book during the second half of the Bush 43 presidency and some people were comparing his time in office to the book. In a similar vein, I have heard the same said about the Obama administration.I won't go into the story, as I am sure other reviewers have done so. What I will say is that the book is compelling and although it begins slowly, it becomes a fascinating read. I found it harder and harder to put down, the further I read. The writing style is a little out of date and there are some sentences that seem backward, but overall it is well written and offers an interesting story.If you try to read it, and can't get into it, let it go for the first 50-75 pages. I assure you it will begin to grow on you as the story unfolds. In my humble opinion, this is a book that should be read by everyone. It serves as a reminder that our democracy is only as strong as the we the people are in acting as guardians.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RS12ZRF0RYMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045121658X#wasThisHelpful","R3RS12ZRF0RYMY","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I ordered this, it was not with the intention of using it to clean all the carpets in our house. We live in a rather large home, and truthfully, the thought of moving furniture to clean holds no interest for me. My intent was for something to clean up the occasional spill, the occasional cat accident and for cleaning the carpet after our daughter has her usually parties during the few times she is home.The machine was easy to put together and it was easy to figure out how to use it. We vacuumed the carpet well before our first cleaning and tried to get up all of the cat hair. We used the machine….spray solution and then suck it up. What came out of the carpet was disgusting…it was way dirtier than I ever would have thought.If you need a machine to clean small areas or to clean on an occasional basis, I think this machine would be a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R145Y7PVPYL53E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R145Y7PVPYL53E","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of the Koch family is one that is fascinating in and of itself, but it becomes even more so during a year when two of the brothers are about to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to elect people that they want in office. They are politically spoiled and want to be able to have their way, no matter what.The biography begins with the father and his start in the business world. While he wasn't necessarily dishonest, his business dealings were on the shady side and he built a nice little concern for himself and his family. Because of litigation over his dubious business practices, he developed a distaste for the government that he certainly passed on to at least some of his 4 sons.That there are 4 sons was a surprise by itself. I think everyone knows Charles and David, but the other 2 are much more obscure and less likely known. The oldest of the brothers is Frederick, who is strange in his own right and really never wanted anything to do with the business, although his aversion did not extend to the money aspect. He spends his time collecting houses, rehabilitating them and then filling them with antiques. A book about im would be possible it its own right.Next in line is Charles, and I think most people are aware of him. He is a fierce libertarian and a shrewd business man that also has a streak of dubiousness to his business practices. At one point he joined a sort of libertarian commune (sort of hard to describe) and when he got bored with that he founded a famous libertarian think tank. He had a falling out with them and now seems to be content to build a vast empire and pull political strings.The next two are twins: David and Bill. David is similar to his brother Charles, with the exception that he is willing to be more open and outgoing, He has out himself on a vice presidential ticket and seems almost to do the bidding of his older brother. Bill, on the other hand, is mostly interested in money and was happy to get his share and then separate from the family.The dynamics of the family are amazing and that any of them are willing to talk to any of the others is rather amazing. All are smart and very well educated, but have distinctly different personalities. Fighting about money…at least for a number of years was a number one hobby of the brothers. One passage that I found of particular interest dealt with the offer Charles made for the stock owned by Frederick and Bill. They thought it was a low ball offer and threatened to try to take the company public to get every dime they deserved. A very highly placed employee took Bill aside and told him if the company was ever taken public, his brothers and a lot of executives would go to prison for quite some time. Very enlightening information!I have only skimmed the surface here. The book s truly fascinating to read and should be on the list of anyone who cares about politics and the influence large sums of money have on the outcomes. In addition, the story of the family is sort of like a soap opera and should appeal to those who like fiction, but as they say, truth is always stranger than fiction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNK4G18KJPJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455518735#wasThisHelpful","RVNK4G18KJPJL","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my experience, most people do not really want to know too much about death and how things work after people die. Except there is a morbid curiosity as to just how things are accomplished, such as embalming, cremation, burial and all the other little details. And my personal opinion is that the more you know, the better equipped you are to handle the situation when it does, inevitably, arise in your life.The author does a wonderful job of leading us through the mechanics of death. Even though I work in the death industry (as a board member of a public cemetery district), I had no idea how a cremation took place. I had a pretty good idea, but wasn't really certain. Now I know, and yes, it is as bad as I pictured.I think many people might think the stories about dead relatives might be exaggerated, but truthfully, they are not. People in grief are very strange creatures and I can tell you from personal experience that a sweet little old lady can turn into a vicious attack dog in 5 seconds or less, unless you treat their loved one the way they expect. And, even though California is experiencing a historic drought, they expect their loved one to lie under a blanket of rich, thick green sod (state watering laws be dammed)The most important thing to come from this book, I think, is letting you know how things work and to realize it is important to plan things out ahead of time and to understand that things do not always go as you might wish for them to go.I found this book to be a wonderful read and recommend it for everyone. It is very well written  and contains very valuable information.

"As you may be able to tell from my heading, I have had Remington electric razors in the past. Some have been corded and some have been rechargeable, such as the one  I have am reviewing here. I have always stuck by Remington, although I can't really explain why.The newest version is nice and I found it to be comfortable to hold while shaving. The shave itself is slightly better than previous versions, but I wouldn't say significantly better. I have never thought electric razors gave really close shaves; hence the reason I use a regular razor for normal shaves and only use the electric for touchups and for between shave shaves.I did like the head guard that came with this razor which helps protect the foil head from being damaged. The flip up trimmer worked well, although I rarely use that feature.Overall, I would say this is slightly better than what I am used to, but still would not use it on a daily basis. I guess it is all in what you get used to. To me nothing will replace a blade for everyday, but this is a nice machine for touch ups, and for shaving away from home, such as in the car before a date or big appointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN0LZ8QPZHVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0X2QVI#wasThisHelpful","R2WN0LZ8QPZHVU","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to admit up front that I am a short story junkie and enjoy the genre greatly. It is my personal belief that short stories are harder to write than novels, if for no other reason than the need to develop the story and characters quickly, which requires concise and precise wording and writing. This anthology of stories did not disappoint me and I found a number of wonderful stories that were totally enjoyable. I will admit that I didn’t enjoy every story, but that is the nature of any anthology and I would most likely think something was wrong if I did like every story.I highly recommend this book to those who love short stories, as well as those that have not become accustomed to the genre. This is a great collection and I will most likely re-read most of the stories a second time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RR52I5TR65UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547939418#wasThisHelpful","R3RR52I5TR65UI","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the summer of 1967, President Lyndon Johnson sent to Congress his nomination for a vacancy on the Supreme Court and it caused an uproar, both among some Senators and quite a few members of the public. His nomination was Thurgood Marshall, an African American attorney with a lengthy and stellar record of working in the field of civil rights, as well as a stint as a U. S. Appeals Court judge and time working as the Solicitor General of the United States.It was actually Jonson's plan to integrate the court and he created a situation where a vacancy on the court was available. Marshall was his first choice, but he knew it would not be an easy task getting his nomination confirmed by the Senate.The book follows the history of the nomination, the hearings and the outcome. Along the way, it offers a history of Marshall's life, and his fight for the rights of African Americans throughout the South during the previous several decades. In addition, the history detours into the conditions for minorities in the South and their fight to gain their rights to vote, get equal education and numerous other issues of concern.Intertwined is also the history of the Dixiecrat Senators who were bound and determined to keep Marshall off of the high court at almost any cost. It covers the tactics they used (such as asking Marshall the names of the individuals who wrote the 14th amendment to the Constitution) and the strategy behind their desire to keep him from the court. It also looks at the most prominent players and how they got elected to the Senate and how they attained their positions on the Judicial Committee.It also delves into the history of why Johnson cared about integrating the court and his backup plan in the event Marshall was not confirmed. Johnson was a master politician, and although he spent most waking hours worrying about Viet Nam. he played the political chess game of the Marshall nomination like a champion.I am nearly 60 years old, and despite being very politically informed at a young age, I barely remember most of the history presented in this book. It is a fascinating look at a tumultuous time in our nations' history as well as an amazing book. I recommend it to anyone with any interest in history. While many history books can be dry and difficult to read, the author of this book made the story come alive in a way that made it almost seem like a novel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4NBUH3ULQTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307957195#wasThisHelpful","RI4NBUH3ULQTK","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a series of stories, or more precisely, essays about a number of things that are familiar to most Southerners. The essays span from food, to lifestyle to growing up Southern and much more.The biggest problem I had with the book is the lack of the ability to relate to people who were not from the South or who didn't grow up there. I really wouldn't have gotten a lot of it were it not for the fact that my wife was born and bred in the South and I had met and spent a far amount of time in the South. A fair amount of what he talks about is the South that is gone and exists only in his memory making it even harder for today's readers to get it.I found the writing interesting and very descriptive. I enjoyed reading it, but I am unsure of the ability of others to ""get it"". Except for the football, that is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K7N6QCIH240/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848746392#wasThisHelpful","R34K7N6QCIH240","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a similar lamp in my desktop, however the switch was in the base and it went bad so I needed to get a new desk lamp. This came up, sadly, right after I had purchased another, similar lamp for my desk, so I put it on my wife's desk. She has a small goose neck style light that was rather weak when it came to lamp output.The base on this light is heavy….heavy enough to avoid tipping over no matter what. It is easy to install and is very sturdy as long as you back the set screw out far enough that the arm can fully seat in the bottom. The swing arm is sturdy and I love that it has the tri nuts that allow you to tighten the arm down when you have it set where you desire it.The light is excellent and comes with 2 settings. Unfortunately for me, due to the desigh of my cubicle style desk, the on/off switch in the wiring makes it too difficult for me to turn on and off from my desk, but it works perfectly on my wife's desk. I wish the switch were in the base, however its current location allows for it to be easily replaced, should it go bad.On the head there is an arm that comes down so adjust the head. Yes, the head gets hot…as do all halogen lamps. If you use it correctly, this shouldn't be a problem…just don't grab the top or put anything over it.This lamp is well made and perfect for my use…I only wish I had obtained it sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R248CAYSU2PROU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV41SLU#wasThisHelpful","R248CAYSU2PROU","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of this book did a fellowship in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York  for 2 years and this is the story of what she went through and what she learned. After deciding that the surgery career she had hoped for was not going to happen, she turned to pathology and finally decided a career in forensic pathology would be best.In an ironic twist, she arrived for her fellowship only a few months before the 9/11 terrorism attack in New York and she learned a lot about mass casualty incidents rather quickly. The book details her life as a medical examiner and discusses various bodies she autopsied and the various gruesome ways one can die. The book is graphic it it's description of what she saw and did, so if you don't have the stomach for this, I would recommend you stay away.

"I have had this filter installed for a few weeks now, and it seems to be working fine. Short of chemically sampling the water at a lab, there really is no way to determine just how effective this unit is. That said, the water tastes about the same as when the original, very expensive filter was installed, so it must be doing something.I did note several advantages to this unit. The amount of dark water from excess charcoal was less than with other brands and it seemed to allow less air into the system, reducing the amount of water wasted while finishing the install. Also, the unit fit perfectly into our Samsung refrigerator with no leaks, etc. Given this unit is about 1/3 the price that I had been paying, it is well worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139JOIAY34QZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT39J0S#wasThisHelpful","R139JOIAY34QZK","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit consists of a lantern, batteries and a repellant pad. The lamp in the lantern is almost non-existent, while the fan hums away sending repellent product into the air. The one advantage of this is that is does not use heat (such as candles) to emit the repellent, as heat attracts mosquitoes. That said, I didn't' think it repelled particularly well, and it was very expensive for the replacement repellent pads.

"If you are going to buy this book to learn what the life of a flight attendant is like, pass it over. You will learn little about what really happens when a plane is flying at 35,000 feet. You will, however, learn a lot about the author and her partying and love life and the escapades of the entire crew!I am certainly no prude, but this actually got boring about half way through. It was off the planes, into the bar, getting loaded and then on to  the various love life activities of the author. Little changed from chapter to chapter, except maybe the location and some of the antics. I have no way of knowing if this book is truthful, but it does seem a bit of a stretch….from the amount she claims they drank, I am surprised they could find the airport, let alone handle a return flight.If this type of book is your style, it would be a good airplane book or a beach book. You won't really learn anything from it, but it might entertain. On another note to the editor…if you are planning to sell a British book with a lot of British slang in it in the US, I would recommend a glossary at the end.

"This book, written in late 2006, contains some interesting material on the effects of the use of fossil fuels on everything from our health to the health of the planet. It does, however miss the mark in some areas, which is understandable as the author had no idea the economy would collapse. And, that changes a fair amount of the data in this book, as consumption habits have changed dramatically.Have you ever noticed how refineries tend to be located in poor neighborhoods where people have little say in what happens in their communities. That is because no one, if they had a choice, would breath the air being spewed from oil refineries. The same can be said about major freeways and highways. They never cut through affluent areas, as people would block the construction of them. As a result, the poorest among us have the most health related problems related to exposure to the byproducts of  petroleum distillation and use. And, that costs every taxpayer, as many of these people are either underinsured or uninsured.Another cost associated with petroleum is the wars we fight to maintain acess to supplies of it, as well as the amount of money we are shipping to countries where there are people that want to eliminate our society. That effect has mitigated due to new production in the US, but we need to start weaning ourselves from the material to continue to be able to supply our own needs.The book details many other costs, and is an interesting, if a tad academic in nature. It is particularly interesting to read now due to the changes that have occurred since it was written. We can now see the very real costs, versus those that have self mitigated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JXW5CHXDEUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597261017#wasThisHelpful","R30JXW5CHXDEUJ","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is an evaluation of rail lines once used and now abandoned and how they will come back into use in the future as real estate becomes more expensive and difficult to locate. The author's main focus is that real estate investors are studying old railroad maps to determine where they could possible expand both residential and commercial real estate in the future. While I believe he stretches the point (I don't see the prospect of abandoned rail lines coming back, unless for light rail), I do believe that there is some validity to his argument. As the price of oil sk rockets, and people look for other ways to commute, I can see rail lines long dead being returned to some kind of service and ""villages"" springing up around them.That said, the writing in the book is muddled and difficult to follow. This may be a great book for a urban planning class, but for an average reader, it is overly complicated and drifts between topics. I cannot recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IKZSS4X3A73T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813928311#wasThisHelpful","R2IKZSS4X3A73T","AE61FFT0GUD2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE61FFT0GUD2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been calling myself a ""lapsed Final Fantasy fan"" for quite some time now. This opinion has started many a flame war on the internet, and quite frankly, I've never understood why. It's hard to defend the sharp nose-dive in quality that the series has taken in recent years. Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have steered what was once supposed to be a series about grand, sweeping adventures into an edgy, grimdark pit occupied by pretty teenagers wearing lots of buckles and zippers.Numerous spin-offs, only a small percentage of which are decent, have saturated the brand name. The core series has somehow gotten less robust and interesting than it once was, with XIII being a series of ornate hallways, XIV being an MMO that, while decent, apes a lot from better, less costly games, and XV looking to be a cribbing of both Monster Hunter and the worst elements of Western AAA games... not to mention possessing the most obnoxious cast to date. While this is just my opinion, I do find it a bit baffling that anybody would adamantly defend the choices Nomura and Toriyama have made, polluting a series that once gave us excellent titles like IV, VI, VII, IX, X and some of the early spin-offs. Different strokes, I guess.And, looking at Final Fantasy Type-0 HD (it was originally a Japan-only PSP title back in 2011,) I really expected more of the same. Long, complicated, fake words that do nothing other than make the story a convoluted garble of boring lore. Characters that look ripped from the cover of Tiger Beat, decked out with zippers that do nothing and lead to nowhere. Boring, generic gameplay that simply allows the player to go from point A to B, and nothing more. Imagine my surprise, then, that Type-0 is not only the best entry in the Final Fantasy series to hit a home console since the PS2 days, but simultaneously one of the most engaging RPGs and exciting action games I've played on a current-gen console. It has problems, yes. Undoubtedly. But it's a step in the right direction.But the plot could fool you into thinking otherwise, initially. There's a school called Akademia (snort) that trains elite soldiers to train in the front lines of a raging war between four nations. All of these students have different abilities, strengths, weaknesses, so on, so forth. One military, in particular, is trying to wage war on all of the nations, and take everything under their iron fist, and it's up to Akademia and their growing list of allies to team up and overthrow the threat. But, despite looking pretty decent on the surface, the intent behind Akademia and its enigmatic head might not be all that they seem. Or... something.Yes, as people who have played this game so far might notice, that is a very, very pared-down version of the narrative. Honestly,  Type-0, despite gradually growing into an engaging, interesting game, still suffers from problems hallmark to Final Fantasy games made in the last ten years. That is to say, the narrative is jam-packed with moronically-spelled words, all crammed together at once, in hopes of building a deep, intricate world with lots to learn about.In actuality, though, it only results in a story that's interesting until people try to actually explain what's happening using made-up lingo. Yes, there are things to help understand it somewhat, but I've always felt that's a bad narrative decision. Your story should make sense and not be packed to the brim with whimsical buzzwords to begin with, which should then stimulate me to learn more, not the other way around. It's not as egregious as the worst parts of XIII, which is apparently part of the same canon, but it can get pretty obnoxious. At least, though, the surface level, bare bones narrative makes enough sense to follow and be engaged by, and again, it does pick up once things get rolling.Luckily, though, the similarities to modern Final Fantasy games end there. Unlike XIII, which made you play for 30-40 hours until the gameplay turned into something more than ""press X and sometimes use an Eidolen to win,"" Type-0 is fun and stimulating right from the get-go. After the lengthy intro, you're dropped straight into combat, and it's soon thereafter that you'll start to realize that this is, mechanically, one of the best entries in the franchise. Playing like a pared-down version of a Devil May Cry-type affair, we have a game that's part action, part role-playing, all fun.Each of the fourteen characters play in a distinctly different way, meaning that players can experiment with both main campaign missions and side quests until they find the party that works for them. Do you want to focus on long-range attacks and buffs, or maybe heavy melee attacks and attack spells? There are dozens of possible combinations, so players are bound to find something they like with all of the choice. There's not really a definitive ""best"" type of trio to have, and it ultimately boils down to how you want to play. Personally, I always find that to be the most rewarding type of game, and I commend the devs for breaking from the traditional ""this is how you do X thing exactly"" rut that Final Fantasy games often find themselves stuck in. It's pretty neat stuff.There's also a ton of different stuff to do on top of the solid base of fast-paced action. This makes for the most Final Fantasy-y Final Fantasy in a while, surprisingly enough. Players can explore Akademia, getting to know the student body, upgrading their characters and attending different classes to strengthen their party en masse. They can take up side-quests to get items, level up, and just find new stuff. They can explore the world map, gradually unlocking more as the campaign continues, and gett lost in optional side-dungeons or cities. There's a ton to here, really, and that's quite the surprise for me. Most action-oriented spin-offs of this series have been linear, not matching up the open-world epic quest feeling of the main games. Now, though, Type-0 ironically feels a lot more like what the franchise is supposed to be than the core games, and that's something worth celebrating, I feel.It's also worth noting that there are light RTS elements sprinkled into the campaign when players overthrow or protect regions, and they're implemented in such a way that it feels like a natural, fun shift, as opposed to unnecessary drudgery. It's nice that this isn't another ActRaiser situation: fun core mechanics, dull progression.There's very little about this game that I'd call dull, actually. Very little, though, not nothing, because honestly, the way that players find themselves leveling their characters is a bit of a slog, and not in line with the fun, streamlined nature of the rest of the package. In fact, I wasn't even completely aware I could upgrade anything until multiple hours into the experience. Done at save crystals, players will use points accrued through leveling up to strengthen their characters of choice, and the experience is quite the tedious one. A long list with annoying pop-ups that are slow to disappear, the process through which players upgrade their characters is monotonous and takes way longer than it should, especially with fourteen effing characters to maintain. It's a royal pain, and an unwelcome departure from a series that has introduced ingenious leveling mechanics like the Sphere Grid and the Crystarium.My sentiments are the same for the process of upgrading spells. When players kill enemies, they explode their corpses (!) and synthesize special gems from them. These gems are used to strengthen magic, and lord, is it easily the worst part of the game. Each element of spell has a series of sub-spells that are only differentiated by confusing acronyms, and not, you know, actual names. And all of the characters have different types of acronym spells, and you have to access a separate screen to see who knows what, and, well, you're probably beginning to see the problem here. You'll end up wasting gems you earned in battle upgrading the wrong spell for the wrong character, without even knowing you're doing so. The system in place here is clunky and unnecessarily complicated, and could have done with more streamlining. It reeks of being limited by its original platform, and not being upgraded for home consoles. Four years after release, that's a bit of a letdown.You know what else wasn't upgraded for home consoles? A lot of the visuals, because, easily, this is one of the most badly textured games on modern consoles. Some of the textures are literally ripped straight from the PSP, and look godawful when blown up on a bigger screen. The same can be said for 80-90% of the NPC models, who are disturbingly static, never doing anything beyond standing in uncomfortable poses and moving ever-so-slightly to simulate breathing. Some parts of this game are simply ugly and a brutal letdown for a series that's always prided itself on sharp visuals.But the odd thing is, it's only some of the textures. Other textures and models and whatnot look astounding, and more in line with what I expect for my sixty-dollar purchase from a AAA publisher. Namely, places you're doing battle and the characters you're controlling look fantastic, and make me long for a version of this game that looks consistently good. It's a bit jarring when a beautifully rendered and animated model is standing next to a static one rendered with muddy textures from a handheld. Yes, the exaggerated motion blur and carefully positioned lighting makes you not notice the visual flaws at times, but it takes only a cursory look to see that this game is not what it could be in the looks department, and that's a real shame. The art direction is great and all, but sometimes, that can only go so far.At the very least, though, the soundtrack is gorgeous. It's the signature mixture of electronic and orchestral sensibilities that has anchored the series since the early 2000's, and it works just as well here as it ever has. In particular, the remixes of classic tunes, like the main theme of the series (used for the background of Akademia) and the darker version of the Chocobo theme (used for the overworld theme) are fantastic. The battle themes are nothing to sneeze at, either, and a bit catchy as well. Oh, and that classic ""victory theme"" is just as good ever, and makes leveling up feel that much more satisfying.Is Final Fantasy Type-0 HD a good game? Undoubtedly, yes. It's the best game in the franchise for way, way too long, and has hours of fun, engaging content that'll keep you busy for quite some time, on top of having a load of replay value. But on the flip side, is it all that it could be? No, not quite. The leveling system is flat-out dull, the visuals aren't up to snuff for a sixty dollar game on a home console, and the plot still has a lot of the same niggling flaws as other entries where Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have been at the reigns.The end result is a game that recaptures what the series is supposed to be all about, but is still held back by some meandering issues that prevent the game from being a gung-ho, balls-out return to glory. Still, though, it's hard to deny that this is a very good game with a lot of great things going for it, and for fans jaded after a series of duds, that's more than enough reason to pick this up.Pros- Interesting story and world- Fantastic core gameplay- Lots of diverse content- Pleasing art direction- Great soundtrackCons- Underwhelming visuals- Dull leveling systems- Counter-intuitive menus- Still a convouluted Nomura/Toriyama jointScore: 8(This review also appears on my website, thefriedcritic.com!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OSK1EGQBVIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWJ4JW4#wasThisHelpful","R15OSK1EGQBVIL","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it acceptable to say nice things about Ninja Theory's 2013 reboot yet? If you were going by the vitriolic Facebook comments that can be found on the franchise's official page, you'd think not. Yes, continuing the current trend of ""buy time for making new games by re-releasing old ones,"" the controversial reboot of ""Devil May Cry"" is now out on the PS4 (which is the version I played) and Xbox One with all the bells and whistles you've come to expect with these sorts of releases. Somewhat upscaled graphics? Check. All the DLC bundled in? Check. Somewhat cheaper price point? Check and check. At this rate, it's become less of ""how much has changed"" and more ""how little am I going to regret buying this game twice""? Luckily, Ninja Theory seems to know that more prudent players are dubious of these rehashes, and has done a lot to merit second-time adopters giving this another go... along with making the best version of the product for newcomers.Is this still the same game that came out in 2013? Largely, yes. The story is the same, of course. Dante is a lovably loudmouthed punk who gets thrown in the middle of an age-old conflict between angels and demons. The latter party controls the world through televised news and soft drinks, among other things. In order to stop their control, Dante, along with Virgil and Kat, learns to tap into his past in order to take down everything keeping America lazy and stupid, then eventually take down the demons behind it all.I said this in my review two years ago, and I'll say it again: the story here is one of the very best out there, at least in terms of video games. It's a sarcastic, rude pop in the face to the side of America that any rational person despises. There's no ""we need to respect these opinions,"" or, ""they have a right to do this"" sort of diatribe here. The writers don't play nice with the material, and why should they? The best political satires are sharp, focused and mean. This is all of that and then some, and by consequence, it feels like a much more mature satire of American society than, say, ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" which is more content to softly poke at things rather than voraciously attack. As far as political games goes, ""DmC"" is one of the smartest and funniest out there, and while it may liberally borrow from ""They Live"" in some capacity, it does enough with the concept that it feels fresh and original.Are there any changes to the story? No, not really. There's a small snippet of dialogue cut out (yes, people are already crying ""censorship,"" but please note the developers just didn't care for the line,) a new cutscene added to provide context to something that happens later in the game, and... well, that's about it. Oh, actually, Virgil's dumb fedora got the axe, too, but I'm not sure anyone was too, erm, euphoric about that look the first time around, right? Right. Moving on.Now, I could go into heavy, heavy detail explaining the numerous, minute changes made to combat here, because that's where the meat of the upgrades lie. But we'd be here for a very, very long time if I talked about all that, and Capcom actually put up a 30-ish page changelog detailing everything new under the hood, so you can just go look at that if you're interested. So I'll keep it brief. Basically, if you button-mashed your way through ""DmC,"" you won't notice a lot of differences here. Maybe you'll see that some bosses are tweaked, or that some enemies take more or fewer hits, but the game will feel basically the same to you. However, if you're one to focus on mastering combos, racking up scores, collecting trinkets, then this is a whole other ballgame. Certain combos don't work the way they used to. It's harder to pull off good Style Combos. A lot of collectibles have been shuffled around. A good portion of enemies react differently to different moves. There's a solid lock-on mechanic. So on, so forth. Again, there are enough changes to merit 30-plus pages of tiny details, but the overall point is that people who love breaking apart a game's mechanics and mastering them will have a field day with this game. The only complaint I might have, perhaps, is that by ""rebalancing"" the gameplay, everything feels a touch easier on the standard difficulty level... but maybe that's just me.Is the gameplay still good, though? Yes, definitely, 100%. Of course, this game still has numerous detractors, people who will try to explain why it's objectively inferior to the originals, because opinions are apparently facts when it comes to video games. To this day, I don't understand the complaints. Everything about ""DmC"" is smooth as butter. Every button press has a certain weight to it, and if you really focus on learning the intricacies of the combat, each move has a distinct feeling of purpose and meaning behind it. Like other action gaming greats like ""Bayonetta,"" the key to victory isn't blindly spamming the same moves until you win. You have to mix things up and have variation to how you tackle each and every enemy. When consumers these days end up spending sixty dollars on titles that are, essentially, five-hour interactive movies with barely any thought put into the gameplay, a game like ""DmC"" still feels woefully unique... even over two years after its release. Compared to other action games in this vein, Ninja Theory's title is very good. Compared to virtually everything else on the market that isn't on the Wii U right now, though, it's a complete and total godsend.In the visual department, get ready for a bit of a trade-off. For the first time on consoles, ""DmC"" runs at a full 60 FPS, and it's one of those games where the difference is massive. Action is blisteringly fast, truly capturing the frenetic energy that the game's tone is trying to convey. Nothing feels plodding or sluggish, and there was absolutely never an instance of stalling, chugging, or even screen tearing on my copy. As far as the performance goes, on top of adding the Turbo Mode (which makes the game go 20% faster, adding a whole other level of challenge,) Ninja Theory has hit it out of the park with this version, and deserves serious commendation. That said... the actual visuals are more lukewarm. Artistically, yes, this is still a very visually arresting game, and at 1080p, you can see virtually every detail about it. The way the world comes alive to try and kill Dante, the varied and amusing facial expressions of characters, the vibrant colors... that's all here. But so are a copious amount of lazy textures that just flat-out don't look good, and were obviously not a huge concern to the devs when touching this game back up. While I would argue that this looks leaps and bounds better than most of these ""Definitive Super Ultra Wombo Combo"" editions, it's still not the sort of game that I expected to playing on ""next-gen"" consoles well over a year after their release, and it's still a tad disappointing that this is still where we are. Paying for upscaled versions of last-generation titles. Kind of sad, if you ask me.I'm not losing much sleep over it, though, because ""DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition"" is still very much worth your money. What with the tweaks in the gameplay department, the new resolution, the improved framerate, all of the bundled DLC, a whole boatload of extras, and on top of that, a very attractive price point... you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. If you have a PS4 or One, and haven't played this already, then it's definitely worth your time and money. It was an excellent title when it came out, and it's only gotten better with all that Ninja Theory has done to it. And for people who picked it up the first time around? I can fairly say that it's the second time, with all of these upscaled re-releases, that I truly feel like the double-dip is worth it (the first being the wonderful ""Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition."") No matter who you are, unless you fall into the ""hating it because it's not like the old ones"" camp, Ninja Theory's take on the venerable demon-slaying franchise is a blast, and this is easily the best version to snag.And if you do fall into that camp, well, you can play as the original Dante from the outset so... you win, I guess?Pros:- Still a funny, well-written game with a likable lead- Gameplay has been honed to a razor's edge- 60 FPS makes a lot of difference here.- Hours upon hours of contentCons:- Lazy visuals in some areas- Feels like a much easier game this time around- It's another re-release, and I'm kind of tired of them, aren't you?Score: 9 (Bomber)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R142PU4WTT0Q70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9NWTQO#wasThisHelpful","R142PU4WTT0Q70","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always feel bad for reviewing Kirby games. Not because they're not fun to play, or because I don't like them. Quite the opposite, actually. As a whole, I love the franchise for all of its various entries and incarnations, almost to a fault. That is to say, there isn't a single entry in the series that I dislike, and so, I feel bad, because anybody reading a review will immediately see my subjective bias towards the cute, cuddly and inventive worlds that various developers always seem to cook up. This time, HAL Laboratory picks the reins back up and takes the series back to the gameplay of 2005's ""Canvas Curse,"" but also brings two new things to the table: claymation and GamePad-snapping difficulty.You read that last part right. ""Kirby & The Rainbow Curse,"" the pink puff's first go at a Wii U title, steers the series in a completely unexpected direction. Historically, the Kirby games have been satisfying little romps that are none too difficult to complete, unless one is trying to 100% the title. Usually, players are able to set their own difficulty, go at their own pace, and play how they want to play. If you're expecting more of that here, you're out of luck, buddy. ""Rainbow Curse"" has a very specific way it wants you to play, and if you don't play by its rules, be prepared to send Kirby careening into chasms, spikes and to a multitude of other grisly ends.Well, grisly to an extent. It's still a Kirby title, meaning that everything is adorable, right down to the sugary sweet story. Kirby's world is attacked by Claymia, who sucks the color out of everything, meaning that the world is a colorless wasteland, and more important, the apple Kirby's about to dig into turns into a grey sphere. Heavy stuff. It's up to players to guide the little guy (with the help of new friend Elline) through a variety of worlds to restore order to everything. Except, Kirby opts out of walking this time around, and with the aid of your trusty stylus and touch screen, you have to draw lines and tap him as he rolls through almost every level. Again, it's the exact same concept as ""Canvas Curse,"" only on a bigger screen and with a new art direction.But as far as that bigger screen is concerned? You won't be using it much, unless you're playing co-op. That's because, due to the very nature of the game, players are forced to almost constantly look down at the GamePad throughout the entire experience. This means that, regardless of how big your TV is, you won't be seeing much of it if you're playing alone. If you even so much as try to draw lines while looking up at the TV, it's going to end disastrously. This may sound like a minor trifle, especially if you have a couch co-op partner (thankfully, my girlfriend loves Kirby as much as I do, so that wasn't an issue,) but it's a massive disappointment because of how utterly gorgeous this game is. Of course, it's hard to focus on the visuals when you find yourself frantically struggling to stay alive.Yes, this game is hard. Very, very hard, to an almost unbelievable extent at times. Not even including the seemingly impossible challenge maps, almost every level after the second world or so is a large-scale, fast-paced puzzle, where the penalty for not solving it is death after death. Kirby rarely stops moving, and the amount of magical brush power stuff that creates lines is limited, meaning that precision becomes critical if you want to survive. A single, tiny flick of your wrist can make or break an entire run, and with the sometimes unforgiving checkpoints and introduction of several heinous enemies, the game eventually evolves into a frustrating exercise in trial and error.That said, unlike some negative reviews directed at this game from big-name websites, I don't believe ""too hard"" is a valid criticism, and in fact, I admire ""Rainbow Curse"" for its challenge. It rarely feels unfair when you lose a life, and generally speaking, it's easy to see where something went wrong. Only every once in a while have I suffered a touch screen hiccup, and for the most part, success relies purely on learning the mechanics. It's the type of difficulty that can be overcome by getting good, as opposed to the type based on artificial boosts in enemy strength or other such garbage. To other critics's credit, though, there are some irritating moments (mainly boss battles) where I felt stuff was up to blind luck, which could have been smoothed over to make a consistent package. I'm not really a fan of ""randomly send Kirby flying everywhere and hope you hit something"" types of encounters, which are admittedly rare, but still present and accounted for. Altogether, however, I do feel like over 90% of the game is based on mastering the mechanics, which is the best sort of difficulty in my mind.Aside from guiding your cute Kirby ball through the colorful worlds, you'll also take control of his various forms, ranging from tank to submarine to airplane. These segments are a nice break in the gameplay, and a total blast to play. Aside from the delight of watching a clay Kirby get molded into another clay figure, the shifts in gameplay are definitely remarkable. That is to say, all of them feel significantly different, and lend variety to the overall package. My personal favorite insofar would have to be the sub, where Kirby automatically fires missiles, and players have to steer the missiles into stuff while simultaneously managing where they are on the screen. It's fun little challenges like this that help make ""Rainbow Curse"" feel like a well-rounded package.Yet there's even more to help with that feeling. Aside from the core game, which is of a decent length, there are numerous, numerous challenge maps, most of which are hellish. There's a whole library of music to collect and listen to in a cute screen where Kirby dances to the beat. You can collect pages of Elline's Secret Diary, which all fit together to form one of the cutest things ever put in a video game. But, most importantly (to me,) there's the collection of virtual figurines you can build. Each one has an adorable description, and can be looked at from virtually every angle, a la the trophies in ""Super Smash Bros."" It's in this collection that you get a real appreciation for the painstaking effort HAL put into this game, ensuring that everything look as much like stop-motion claymation as possible.Which, in turn, makes this a visually arresting experience unlike anything on the market. I feel like this is something I have to say about every major Wii U game at this point, just to remind people that raw processing power does not equal good visuals, but I'll say it again: ""Rainbow Curse"" has better graphics than most PS4 or One games. I would know, I own both consoles, so please, keep that in mind before mouthing off. Look, when you look at this game, you see a beautiful world that looks and moves and feels like it was handcrafted. Coasting or rolling or diving through levels, or looking at the gorgeous virtual figurines, I was convinced that this game was interactive claymation at several points. It's bright, smooth, crisp, and just downright pleasing to look at. You can use however many polygons or whatever high-tech engine or whatever other thing that can be done better on a PC to render 1886 London or Revolution-era France, but that doesn't change the fact that your game is grey and brown and full of people and stuff that run together, not to mention look the same as almost every major release on the market. I may get flak for saying this, but add ""Rainbow Curse"" to the pile of Wii U games (including ""Super Mario 3D World,"" ""Pikmin 3,"" ""Mario Kart 8"" and ""Bayonetta 2"") that look better than almost anything else the competitor has to offer, outside of rare exceptions like... I dunno, ""Sunset Overdrive,"" I guess?And tying this aesthetically stunning package together is something I rarely take time to commend: the soundtrack. This, hands-down, might be the best music ever put in a Kirby game. Not only does it provide catchy takes on classic jams, but most of the soundtrack is composed of new music, and it's all stellar. Utilizing several different styles and instrumental arrangements, the musical soundscapes here are top-notch, and I seriously hope that consumers are able to get their hands on a copy of this soundtrack, whether physically, digitally, or both. Yes, it's that good, a perfect blend of retro and modern sensibilities. Marvelous, in a word. Oh, and Kirby's little squeaks and grunts are cuter than ever.""Kirby & The Rainbow Curse"" has a few issues. I'm not denying that. Some of the boss stages are frustrating. Having to look down at the touch screen in single-player is a bummer. The controls definitely mess up at times. But despite those, it's excellent based on three criteria that I hold near and dear to my heart, and help me decide how to score a game. Firstly, it's a wildly original title, what with the inventive art style, great implementation of the GamePad, and a great co-op mode (the second player plays the game like a standard platformer, making for some interesting times.) Secondly, it has a distinct style of gameplay that is undeniably challenging, but based in mastery and problem-solving as opposed to mindless repetition. And third, it's a bang for your buck. For forty bucks, you get a great single-player AND co-op game, loads of supplementary content, and hours upon hours of replay value. It's a total bargain. Oh, and to top it all off, it's all cute as a button.In a gaming landscape where things keep getting greyer and big-name releases keep blending together, a game like ""Kirby & The Rainbow Curse"" helps to remind me that there are still people out there that care about making fun, original titles that don't shove DLC down your gullet and end in a series of quick-time events. Because of that, it comes with my highest recommendation.And seriously, guys. It's really adorable. Do you see that cover? Do you? If that doesn't sell you on it, well, I have nothing left to say to you.Pros:- A wildly original title- A beautiful art style- Fantastic soundtrack- Loads of content- Cute- Really, really cuteCons- Occasional control hiccups- Some boss fights are mechanically frustrating- Solo players barely get to look at the TVScore: 9.0 (Bomber)amiibo Impressions: The amiibo integration here is pretty nifty, as it's useful, but you won't suffer without it. Kirby amiibo figures allow you to use a super dash ability at anytime; DeDeDe lets you have twice the normal amount of health; Meta Knight makes your attacks tougher. Keep in mind, these only work for one level, you can only do it once a day, and oh yeah, it's next to impossible to get DeDeDe or Meta Knight currently. I used a Kirby for the sake of this review, and will probably use it again at times. Again, it's not imperative to the game, but it's a nice supplement. Plus, the figures themselves are, of course, fantastic. A nice complement to an already stellar game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9N0IV3C9481/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFCUNS#wasThisHelpful","R3D9N0IV3C9481","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a year ago, I was talking to my girlfriend when she was in the middle of playing 2011's excellent ""Ocarina of Time 3D"" about the possibility of ""Majora's Mask"" getting the same treatment. We both agreed that it was next to impossible. It was a smaller Zelda game, that from my understanding didn't sell particularly well, and its dark, sinister setting seems to not jive with the tone modern incarnations have. And yet, here we are, four years later, give or take a few months, holding what may very well be the definitive version of the game in our hands. Was it worth the wait?Most definitely. ""The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D"" is a loving restoration of the dark horse favorite in Nintendo's flagship adventure franchise. Every detail is lavishly restored with eye-popping visuals that run at a crisp framerate. New mechanics are added to make the game more accessible, while still retaining the core difficulty fans expect. And it's a large, intricate game packed with content that can be put in your pocket and played anywhere at any time. A game that, at one point, was thought to only be possible on consoles, yet somehow is a vast improvement over the past incarnation.Believe it or not, this is the first time I've seriously played through the game, having only dabbled in it in the past. For the first time, I can truly appreciate the darkness inherent in the world and in the narrative. Nothing in ""Majora's Mask"" feels heroic or grand. Everything is grimy, sinister, creepy. Even when Link is technically saving the world from the machinations of the Skull Kid, who plans to destroy the planet with the aid of a grinning moon, the player doesn't feel like a savior. They're accomplishing things by harnessing the souls of dead characters through putting on masks. The way to Termina's salvation is paved with the bodies of fallen heroes, and as the last one standing, all of their hopes and desires rest on your shoulders. Kind of intense, right?That's why I'd have to say that ""Majora's Mask"" may be my new favorite Zelda game. Never before has the idea of being a ""hero"" and ""saving the world"" been undercut so dramatically by the narrative itself, at least in this franchise. It challenges the very structure of the traditional hero's journey narrative. True, it adheres to the basic highlights, but does so much different from other entries and other fantasy games in general. There's no princess to save. There's no significant rise to action. Link is simply thrown in the middle of turmoil and expected to thrive, and he barely does so. In fact, one could argue that he doesn't, and that his entire journey wouldn't happen if it weren't for the benevolent spirits guiding him every step of the way. Not to get too deep here, but I might go so far as to say that ""Majora's Mask"" is a cynical critique of the typical Zelda plot, much in the same way that landmark works like ""Watchmen"" and ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" were critiques of their respective mediums. The ""lone savior saves the land and gets the girl"" type of story is deconstructed and challenged, and that's what makes ""Majora's Mask"" so memorable to me. It's something different, and something that hasn't been done since.Of course, it wouldn't be much of an undercutting if the basic formula wasn't altered somewhat. It is, though, which is another rarity. There are four main dungeons, not eight or more. You don't get to the first dungeon until a good deal in. There are an unconventional amount of side-quests. And, of course, there are the masks. Masks which alter Link's body and give him an arsenal of cool abilities. Skip on water as Deku Link, zip around like Sonic as Goron Link, or effortlessly cut through water as Zora Link. The masks help break up the typical ""go around with a sword and some items"" format. All of this, combined, make for an entry that looks, feels and plays differently from its brethren, and by consequence, in a time where I've grown a little weary of the formula (especially after the multitude of misfires in ""Skyward Sword,) feels fresh. Which is ironic, considering it's well over a decade old.Of course, the fetch quests are a hit or miss for some people. I really enjoy them. Micro-managing people's schedules, getting little trinkets to get more trinkets in order to get even MORE trinkets... all of that is kind of my jam. It reminds of the old days in the best way possible, where getting new stuff wasn't simply a matter of progressing the story, where players weren't spoonfed everything. Basically, it feels archaic, but in a good, nostalgic way, instead of a monotonous, clunky way. I'm aware that not everybody has the same affinity for this style of gameplay, and I respect that. But for me, it's a fun way to add length to a game, provided the rewards are worth all the back-and-forthing. And considering that the eventual reward here is the famous Fierce Deity Mask, I'd say it totally is.That said, there are a few new tweaks here to make the fetching and questing a little more easily managed. For starters, there's the overhauled Bomber's Notebook. It not only keeps track of everybody's schedule, but automatically tracks each and every side quest for players. This makes managing everything a lot less frustrating and allows for greater focus on certain tasks. On top of that, players are able to save far more often than before, what with the numerous save points scattered across the map. And, of course, there's the return of the Sheikah Stone from the previous remake, which lets players who need a little help get an idea of what they need to do next. These additions, on top of some remixed dungeons and boss stages, make the game feel like a more streamlined package, while still retaining a good deal of challenge.The original ""Majora's Mask"" doesn't look too hot by today's standards. Not so with this beautiful remake. This is one of the most visually arresting games I think I've played on the 3DS, matching and maybe even topping personal standards like ""Resident Evil Revelations"" and ""Kirby: Triple Deluxe."" Of course, like the original, there are reused assets from ""Ocarina of Time,"" but you barely notice in the face of all the improvements. Character animations are more detailed and expressive. Environments feel more distinct than ever before. The colors are vibrant, bringing the mysterious land of Termina to vivid life. And, most impressively, the framerate and load times are impeccable, even when playing on the standard 3DS XL. It's a beautiful, crisp game, perhaps even more so than ""Ocarina,"" that makes the most of the console, and on top of that, has pretty spectacular 3D effects.As a newbie to the full ""Majora's Mask"" experience, I'm finally seeing what the whole fuss is about. I kind of expected the same old, same old from it, and tapered my expectations accordingly. But what I found was something much, much more. So much more in fact, it not only puts modern Zelda games, but a lot of modern games in general, to shame. Yes, it's a collection of fetch quests that reuses a lot of assets from the previous game, but the extent to how different the whole package feels is remarkable. It's dark, but not artificially so. It's epic, but not lavishly so. It's emotional, without stooping to Spielberg levels of heartstring-tugging. In more simple terms, it's the most stripped-down, raw, genuine entry in the venerable series, and hits on something that I feel hasn't been touched since, with the possible exception of ""Twilight Princess.""This may be one of my shorter reviews, because everything I can say about this game boils down to one sentiment. ""The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D"" is an unconventional game in the best way possible, and nothing like it has been made since its release. And now, Nintendo has given us a version that's been improved in virtually every area. There might not be something this unique for years to come.Pros:- The narrative is dark, twisted, almost cynical- Unconventional structure for a Zelda game- Great art design rendered with gorgeous graphics- More accessible than the previous versionCons:- Fetch quests aren't for everyone.Score: 10","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLUVVG85FU175/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PB9LZQI#wasThisHelpful","RLUVVG85FU175","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Techland is a developer built upon a series of caveats. For every ounce of promise in one of their titles, there's always some sort of flaw, mishap, or otherwise unfortunate design choice that hampers the overall experience. In other words, it just wouldn't be a Techland game without an intriguing concept held back by bad production choices. For better, for worse, it's sort of their trademark at this point. So, when going into one of their titles, one usually needs to taper their expectations accordingly, so the good can surprise you, and the bad you're already braced for.When the initial hype train for ""Dying Light"" left the station, and I discovered that it was, in fact, a Techland game, my response was apprehensive at best, turned off at worst. I'd grown tired of wading through the myriad issues in all of their titles just to glean something good out of the experience, and just wasn't interested in yet another zombie game. Yet their last project, ""Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,"" was a fantastic title, and gave me a bit more faith in their future endeavors. So I took the bait, and for once, I'm glad I did. ""Dying Light"" is one of the most interesting AAA titles in ages, and the most promising new IP in recent memory. Maybe that seems like hyperbole, but it's something that I stand behind. What with all the corridor shooters and tower-climbing simulators, the AAA marketplace has grown stagnant with a sense of ""same-ness,"" Despite obvious cribs from other games, ""Dying Light"" does a flying leap over competitors in terms of originality and pure fun.That originality starts at the story, shockingly, which is something I never thought I'd be saying about this title. Zombies are kind of beat at this point, to be honest, and whatever life they had in them was drained by ""The Last of Us"" and ""The Walking Dead."" Somehow, though, the world and scenario of this game managed to grab me and not let go. Players are put in the shoes of an undercover GRE (Global Relief Effort) agent Kyle Crane, and thrown into the impoverished yet oddly beautiful Harran to hunt down a terrorist. But no sooner does he arrive than is he swept into a group of people trying to survive after a viral outbreak of a rabies mutation has zombified most of the inhabitants of Harran. Crane ends up aligning himself with them while trying to act as a double agent for the GRE, and throughout the game, he becomes gradually torn between his mission and his growing concern for his new allies.The whole idea of being trapped in a liminal space between honor and duty isn't new or original, but the way in which it's executed in ""Dying Light"" is impeccable in its approach. Players aren't given any reign over Crane's decisions, so as he's struggling to do the ""right"" thing in any given moment, players have to experience this from his perspective. They're forced to watch his decisions help or hurt others, to see if he'll take the high or low road, to live every mistake he makes. This is a stark contrast to the trend of giving players the keys to the story, and to me, it's a bold move on part of Techland. There are obvious wrongs that Crane perpetrates, yet players are helpless to stop him, and in a way, forced to be a sort of accomplice. That basic disconnect between player actions and character choices doesn't always work, and can sometimes ruin a game. Yet here, I feel as if it does a good job of defining Crane as more than just a generic, run-of-the-mill self-insert, which is a serious challenge to first-person games.Anchored by Crane's struggle to define his own morals,steered by some pretty major twists after the halfway point, and supplemented by a cast of surprisingly robust and diverse characters, the narrative in ""Dying Light"" is one that's better than it has any right to be. A modern zombie game with such a conventional set-up shouldn't have a decent plot, yet lo and behold, it has not only an acceptable one, but a memorable one at that. There's some cool stuff brewing in this game, and I'd behoove players to try and pay attention to it. It's definitely worth your time.But is it worth playing to experience that story? Is the talked-up parkour gameplay really that special, or does it swan dive into a ""Dead Island"" meets ""Assassin's Creed"" pitfall? Much to my surprise, ""Dying Light"" manages to do plenty to differentiate itself from that latter title, with more nuanced gameplay than ""hold a button to win."" As players leap from rooftop to rooftop, plummet 20-30 feet, balance atop railing and other things in that vein, they have to pay the utmost attention at all times. One poorly timed jump or slip from a ledge, and you'll be sent to your death, either at the hands of gravity or the hoards of zombies that roam the streets. For the first time since ""Mirror's Edge,"" which is an obvious inspiration on this title, parkour feels like something entirely in the player's control. As you learn the ins and outs of the mechanics, you'll notice yourself being able to pull off trickier maneuvers as time goes by. Combine that with being able to upgrade Crane through a skill tree, and you've got a pretty rewarding experience in terms of navigating the impressive world.But the combat is a different story, sadly. It's... unremarkable, to say the very least, and some might even hazard to call it ""sloppy"" or ""unpolished."" On top of that, it's uninspired as all get-out, because it's simply the ""Dead Island"" combat copied and pasted into a new title, then given a fresh coat of paint. The melee often feels unwieldy, leaving players unable to figure out what, exactly, Crane is going to do with the weapon he has in his hands. Bash? Swing? Something else entirely? It's too unpredictable, and coupled with weapons that break too easily (sorry, wrenches don't bust after hitting a skull five to ten times,) and a stamina system that needs to be upgraded to not be horribly limited, it feels like a huge lash against an otherwise fun title. Imagine the ""Dead Island"" combat, but less consistent and more up to chance, and you've got a clear idea of how the mechanics feel. It's not the worst combat I've experienced in a game, but it's far from ideal in tense situations when quick, direct actions are needed.At least the ranged combat fairs a bit better. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the gunplay and projectile combat are the most memorable parts of fighting off zombies and thugs here. This isn't a title where you get a gun and then get free reign to wail on opponents. It's a tactical, tense affair that feels incredibly gratifying, and honestly, I wish that guns were more of a focus in the title, considering your firepower is somewhat limited, and guns don't even get introduced until way later in the game. Techland crafted some fantastic shooting mechanics, then barely ever utilized them, and honestly, that's a total waste in my book. As far as other projectiles are concerned, though, they're plentiful and a delight to use. There's just something special about a game that lets you jump off a rooftop, chuck an exploding throwing star into an enemy's head, then bolt off as they burst into pieces behind you. So, again, as long as the combat is based away from Crane, it's visceral and satisfying. It's when it gets in the proximity of a few feet that it sort of falls to shambles... even if the slo-mo zombie decapitations are fun at times.Two last things worth mentioning that elevate this game above other zombie titles are the nighttime gameplay and the PS4-exclusive features. Yes, believe it or not, I really just said that last part. Anyway. The former, which (obviously) takes place during the night cycles of the game, turn ""Dying Light"" from ""Dead Island with parkour"" into ""Outlast in an open world."". All of the zombies become ridiculously powerful, and more advanced breeds hunt Crane down by climbing and chasing after him at breakneck speeds. This shifts the focus from platforming and zombie killing to just trying to run for dear life and hope for the best. It's intense, fun, and helped to shape some of the best survival horror moments I've had in a game since last year's excellent ""Alien: Isolation.""As far as PS4 features go, it's all a bunch of gimmickry... but I'm a sucker for solid, well-implemented gimmickry when it comes to games, and ""Dying Light"" fits that bill quite nicely, more than any other game on the console. The controller clanks with each reload of a gun, lights up when the flashlight is switched on, and talks to the player when a character is coming in through walkie-talkie. It's all stuff that's been done in other titles, but it just feels more seamless and less forced here. The implementation draws you into the experience instead of yanking you out with needless touch-pad distraction or making you holding the controller a weird way, and to me, that's the mark of a good gimmick when it comes to video games. A supplement, not a distraction. Hats off to Techland for making the most of the system's little bells and whistles in a fun way.Also, hats off to them for creating something this jaw-droppingly gorgeous on a home console. Now that the PS4 and One have been out for well over a year, we're finally started to see developers try to get the most of the systems, and there's no better example of that than this game. Rivaling the PS4's most gorgeous titles, like ""Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition"" and ""Far Cry 4,"" the world of ""Dying Light"" is elegant in its mastery of a bleak, oppressive atmosphere, and beautiful in its attempts to show players an ancient, lived-in city on the brink of destruction at the hands of zombies and humans alike. Players can climb atop tall buildings and see the landscape for miles, then simply go wherever they want, with the only loading screens reserved for going inside major interiors. This sort of ""see a place and go to it"" aspect is something I value very, very highly in open-world games, and few have done it this well on current consoles. The world is interesting to look at and explore, and the textures used to render it are disarmingly pretty, to the point where I sometimes forget I'm even playing a game. Really, this is one of the prettiest games on the market right now, and a nice sign of things to come for this generation, I hope.To recap, ""Dying Light"" is a beautiful game with an engaging story, held together by perhaps the most compelling parkour mechanics ever put together, and polished off with a sprawling world jam-packed with stuff to do. On top of that, the PS4 version has some awesome controller chicanery, and the night time sequences are thrilling and terse. If it weren't for the deeply flawed and frustrating combat, something that the limited and unsubstantial crafting mechanics don't help, this would be a near-perfect experience. Yet, unfortunately, they hold back and hamstring an otherwise stellar experience. What we're left with is a game that, for all intents and purposes, is an easy recommendation... provided players can put up with serious mechanical problems. So, yes, it's still a Techland game in that sense. Big shocker.Yet I find myself not hating this game as much as their past titles, if at all. In fact, I'd say that ""Dying Light"" manages to hit all of the right notes outside of close range zombie-slaying, and could be a contender for the best game they've made yet. I'd also say that it brings something truly unique to the market, which is a relief, considering most AAA titles these days are a resounding disappointment and an excuse to buy DLC above all else. While, yes, some parts of the game are cobbled together from other, more popular titles, these elements work to provide a level of familiarity as opposed to feeling like straight rip-offs. It lets players not think about certain things and focus on mastering the new, innovative mechanics on display instead, which I feel isn't a bad trade-off.So, yes, if I were more cynical, I'd say that ""Dying Light"" is a typical Techland title, what with the enormous caveat of ""the melee combat blows"" threatening to hamper the entire experience. Yet everything else is so sublime and presented so well that I can't write this game off as a failed experiment. I feel like the developers did exactly what they set out to do, then added the combat as an afterthought, plain and simple. The result is a game that is one step shy of true greatness, yet still somehow manages to pull off being a great game well worth almost anyone's time. As the first ""big"" title of 2015, it's a blast, and hopefully sets a precedent for how to pull off unique, interesting games in a rapidly stagnating marketplace. If Techland tweaks the combat, the sequel could very well end up being one of the best games I've ever played. Here's hoping.In the meantime? Don't write ""Dying Light"" off as just another Techland joint, because you'd be missing out on one of the most intriguing open-world titles in quite some time.Pros:- The game world is detailed, beautiful, life-like.- Parkour is sublime and nuanced.- The night time gameplay is pitch-perfect.- Narrative is shockingly compelling and engaging.- The PS4 gimmicks are fun and help provide immersion.Cons:- The melee combat is a sloppy mess.- Fun, tight gunplay is underutilized.- Techland needs to stop aping their own ""Dead Island.""- Opening is a bit slow, takes a while to get going.- Frame rate is a tad inconsistent at times.Score: 8.5 (Groovy)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7E1EPY8XL3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2ZK1IG#wasThisHelpful","R1O7E1EPY8XL3O","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where would quirky Japanese games be in America be without the Persona series? The popularity of Atlus’ flagship spin-off to the larger Megami Tensei series opened up the floodgate for dozens upon dozens of weird, niche titles that now commonly populate store shelves. Yet very few achieve the level of success, let alone the quality, found in the seminal franchise.Something about the seamless blend of randomized dungeon crawling and dating sim mechanics just works, and has worked ever since the series as we know it was born with Persona 3. But can the characters and stylistic choices from both that game and its wildly popular sequel succeed outside their element? In short? Yes.Developed by the same internal team who brought you the notoriously difficult Etrian Odyssey series, Persona Q is a first-person dungeon crawler that operates largely in the same way as that franchise. Players go through preset dungeons, drawing the map as they go along, and run into frequent random battles. Each floor of a dungeon has large enemies (called FOEs here) that run amok and shouldn’t be engaged until one has long since mastered that dungeon.But despite the core similarities to the Etrian games, I can’t help but feel that Persona Q is a far more polished, organized and overall more fun experience. I think part of that lies in the sense of progression and organization. Instead of a large open world populated with several, several dungeons, there’s a small hub world and five dungeons.While that may seem a bit scant, each dungeon will take you an upwards of 10 hours at the very least, and that’s just on first clearing. Expect plenty of returns to levels both to grind and to take care of FOEs. And then there’s the hub world, which is home to several hours just of spoken dialogue and anime cutscenes. So, in spite of seeming like smaller title, Persona Q is still a large time sink with plenty of content.And I think that’s important, actually.  It demonstrates that you can have a lengthy title while still having some steady sense of progression and an organized layout. I’ve always felt like the Etrian games lacked a coherent structure, even though they’re definitely good RPGs overall. The overwhelming sense of disorder and lack of instruction is more frustrating than fun for me. But Persona Q introduces a bit of a compromise. Unexplored dungeons with unrelenting difficulty married to a tidy, minimalist hub that progresses the story. I like it.Speaking of the story, it’s a bit of compromise in and of itself… much like the Persona series as a whole. I mean, this is a franchise where solving serial murders and stopping mass depression diseases is interspersed with sub-plots about puppy-dog romance and peppy school trips. Here, there’s definitely a focus on the lighter side of things.Taking part at a point in both Persona 3 and Persona 4 when all party members are available, it weaves a yarn where the casts of those games are thrown into a perpetual high school cultural festival into a dimension that definitively falls outside of the ordinary space-time continuum. And while this is still a Persona game, meaning some deliciously ridiculous plot twists, the story is a largely farcical one.The reason for that? This is, first and foremost, a game for franchise fans. It’s an excuse to see characters you know and love fight side-by-side, break the fourth wall, and crack jokes. While, yes, this is still a canonical entry in the universe, and there is some interesting and serious stuff that happens, it’s definitely more interested in self-referential hijinks than main entries. When you think of a game revolving around fan service, this could practically be the poster child.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. For any non-fans who might pick this up, scarce as they may be, everything else here is definitely top-notch, and there’s at least some moderate universe explanation. The localization is punchy and fun, as per usual, and the character dynamics are just as good as they’ve always been. And despite the story being played fast and loose, it’s still a fun yarn to follow.As mentioned above, the gameplay is basically the same as it has been throughout the whole Etrian franchise… to an extent. Yes, you map out dungeons, and yes, the battles are in first-person, but everything else is pure Persona. That rings true for everything from enemy weaknesses to the flow of combat to the usages of Personas. I mean, the same battle strategies I used throughout the entirety of Persona 3 Portable work here. And the same enemies have the same vulnerabilities. People who have sunk dozens of hours of their lives into these games will feel right at home here.There are some differences, of course. Characters can be equipped with secondary Personas, which give them supplementary abilities and HP/SP buffs. This comes with a bit of a trade-off. On the one hand, it means that characters can be equipped with different Personas and be more adept to varying situations. On the other? It’s entirely possible to create a completely overpowered character who spends barely any MP and takes very little damage, and within the first 20 hours of play, no less.While I take no issue with this, some may feel a bit let down at how the secondary Persona mechanic significantly dampers the “risk and reward” formula. To be fair, though, those people may be better off playing some of the higher difficulty levels, as there are four to choose from. The easiest, “Safety,” lets players start over any battle they lose without getting a game over.  But “Risky,” the hardest? Prepare for a game over when the main character falls in battle, on top of ridiculously amped-up difficulty in combat.So, despite the added mechanics which ease progression, there’s still challenge to be had here. Even “Easy” mode is nothing to sneeze at for the first several hours of play time. Overall, I would say that the gameplay in Persona Q is a nice blend of accessible and challenging. It successfully manages to give people who expect difficulty some of what they want, while not seeming like an insurmountable task to newcomers.And the presentation? The presentation is among the best on the system, and the reason I say that boils right down to one thing: the art direction. The art direction is varied and beautiful, with each dungeon possessing different motifs and directions. You’ll travel through an ominous version of Wonderland. You’ll get lost inside a maze of Japanese horror movie tropes. And, when out of combat, you’ll get to interact with adorably cherubic versions of the Persona 3&4 casts.Everything about the stylistic choices here just works. It blends the threatening with the cuddly with such effortlessness that it continues to impress me. If you’re looking for something that is stylistically unlike anything out there, this is a sure contender.It would be impossible to review a Persona game without giving props to Shoji Meguro, the maestro behind the music. Aside from more original tracks in his eclectic blend of every style known to humans, Persona Q also contains plenty of tracks from both of the featured games, both in their original and remixed forms.  As expected, it all sounds great, and really rounds out the package to make this feel like an authentic entry in the series.And that’s what I think surprises me most about Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth. People can argue day in and day out about what makes a Persona game what it is, but I think it’s pretty simple. You can change the gameplay around, mess with the progression, and even put a heavier focus on comedy. But at the end of the day, it’s the characterization, the style, and the atmosphere that make these games so endearing and wonderful.“Wonderful” is an apt word to describe Persona Q, actually. It’s been one of the rare games this year that both challenged me and motivated me to rise up to the task. No matter how much the difficulty gets ramped up, it stays impossible to put down for more than a little bit at a time.And while perhaps this is lacking some of the more substantial bits in other entries that would push it to a higher score for me, I still say that Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth is a damn fine game that most RPG enthusiasts will love, and that all Persona fans must have.Pros:– An accessible yet challenging adventure spanning 50+ hours.– A great art and sound direction make it feel authentic.– Progression feels steady and gradual, very organized.– Localization is top-notch and snappy.Cons:– Secondary Personas can make characters overpowered.– Story lacks complex social issues tackled in main entries.Score: 9.25","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZZHN1P4CYD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVRK3EU#wasThisHelpful","R1VZZHN1P4CYD0","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dance in the Vampire Bund has truly come into its own as a series over the course of its lengthy run. What started as a pulpy vampire series with copious amounts of fan service and overblown violence has turned into, basically, a political conspiracy thriller with vampires… while still maintaining a certain quota of fan service and violence. Because why not?The point being, creator Nozomu Tamaki has crafted a rich world populated by diverse characters acting as players in a huge, overarching narrative. Now, after a hiatus to work on some side-series, the main brunt of the DitVB narrative is back in full swing again. And if this first volume is any indicator, readers are truly in for something special.It always shocked me, truly, that Seven Seas got on board with publishing something like Dance in the Vampire Bund in the first place. After all, this was the company that balked at releasing Kodomo no Jikan (retitled as Nymphette) in America due to the entire premise being, well, patently pedophiliac. Yet DitVB always had more shocking content to me, and despite protagonist Mina Tepes technically being hundreds of years old, she still looks like a child with baby fat routinely put in unsavory sexual situations. I suppose that’s less offensive than a third-grader trying to sleep with her adult teacher, but still, visually, there’s some weird stuff that could potentially make certain individuals do a double take.Which is why, in Scarlet Order, I was actually a bit surprised at just how restrained Tamaki has become over the years. The first chapters of the original series featured the main protagonist, Akira, dressing and undressing Mina, as well as rubbing oil on her naked body. Here, we barely get any glimpses of nudity from her, and the only full-frontal we get is from a woman encased in crystal. This is no longer the untamed, fan-service-laden series it was when it first hit the pages of Comic Flapper almost a decade ago. Despite the fact that, yes, every woman looks like they’re about to burst out of their clothes, that’s not what the reader’s attention is drawn to.Instead, almost every page is packed the brim with word balloons and text filled with complicated political jargon, which is a direction the franchise has been taking since about 3/4 of the way through the initial series. Of course, there are still action sequences, and yes, there are still plenty of heavily sexualized ladies (and the occasional dude) to go around, but readers will be spending more time trying to process all of the complex lingo and layered conspiracies being conveyed in the text, as opposed to ogling the characters.The thing is? I don’t mind that one bit, personally. What initially drew me in to Tamaki’s twisted web of vampiric politics were the intricate world and dynamic characters, and to me, the fan service and blood n’ guts always distracted from that. Now, there are barely any distractions, and instead of feeling like I’m reading a violent T&A manga that has some occasional plot, it feels like much more of a plot-driven work with the occasional violence and T&A. It’s a huge shift, and one that I, as a longtime fan, appreciate.But is the core narrative any good? To me, it’s gearing up to be the best story arc we’ve seen from the series yet. While the “evil twin” concept in the second half of the original series was fun, it eventually spun out of control and was wrapped up in a hasty, haphazard manner. Now, Tamaki’s reeled it back in, and is seemingly giving us a story that operates on multiple levels. There’s a radical religious terrorist cell dedicated to the eradication of all vampires. There’s a freshly-awakened bloodsucker who’s running amok in Tokyo. There’s the growing political tensions stemming from the fact that Japan’s economy is now intrinsically tied to and run by vampires. Throw some romantic drama into the mix, and you’ve got a rough idea of what you’re dealing with here.This type of story, where several concurrent narratives are happening, is what’s kept me reading this series for almost five years now, and I dare say is something that Tamaki is a bit of a master at. It’s all deliciously complicated and can’t be read passively. Scarlet Order‘s first volume not only requires your utmost attention, but demands it if you want to derive any sort of enjoyment from your reading experience. So while, yes, it’s a complicated, wordy yarn, it’s worth paying attention to.That isn’t to say that everything is entirely perfect here, because despite being an enjoyable read, some things are rearing their head that could become an issue if they continue unchecked. First off, despite the excellent female characterization, Tamaki still relies a bit too much on the whole “world that’s incredibly awful to women” trope. This time around, we see two women dragged into a van and almost raped by a gang of thugs. In the middle of getting their clothes ripped off, though, they’re saved by the aforementioned new vampire villain, who murders the men and (seemingly) leaves the women alive. Sexual assault is a thing that happens, yes, but it’s also a really lazy way to up the ante of a scene in any media, and there are countless ways in which Tamaki could have shown his new villain wrecking some criminals without stooping to that level. He’s better than that, in my opinion.Secondly, the character of Akira’s longtime friend, Yuki, is starting to feel a bit forced. Initially, her purpose was to crush on her friend and be jealous of Mina. Then, she became Mina’s best friend, and provided emotional support for her. And then, she became a paralyzed mute that used her brainy disposition to help solve the mystery of the “fake Mina.” And now, she’s… just kind of there, stuck somewhere between a background character and a trusty companion, her role in this volume incredibly underwhelming. With such a great development of her character near the end of the first series, it’s really a shame to see her already falling into the ranks of the maids and Mina’s advisors. I’m hoping Tamaki does something cool with her, because she’s just too good of a character to waste like that.As for everything else, it’s top-notch as usual. Tamaki’s art is fantastic, and even if you’re not a fan of his “gargantuan bosoms and rippling six-packs” style, there’s no denying that he has a certain visual flair. Characters have a ridiculous range of facial expressions, and every panel is packed with so much fluid motion that it almost feels cinematic at times. Not only that, but he’s proven once again that he’s one of the few modern manga-ka that can draw people of color in both a non-insulting fashion and in a way that you know they’re not just really tan Japanese people. I feel like that’s worth mentioned because, again, it’s a rarity in modern manga, and it’s nice to see him carry on his tradition of diverse representation, comparatively speaking.The first volume of Scarlet Order: Dance in the Vampire Bund II sets into motion a lot of plot threads, and all of them seem particularly enticing, and perhaps even better than the first series, despite Yuki seeming to no longer be an important character. That said, Tamaki still relies a bit too much on female victimhood to artificially amp up tensions, which is a pitfall he’s always been sort of trapped by, and one that I hope goes away with time. Still, this is a good read, and if you’re as much of a fan of the franchise as I am, you’ll be pleased with the direction it’s taking.Pros:– Beautiful art as per usual.– The new story arc looks to be a good one.– Segues from the original in a way that doesn’t feel awkward.– A diverse cast of interesting characters.Cons:– Some major characters are getting a downgrade.– More of Tamaki’s typical “women in peril” filler.Grade: B+ (Groovy)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5YN59B61W8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626921385#wasThisHelpful","RB5YN59B61W8D","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fighting games sure have had a big surge in recent years, huh? Thanks in no small part to the massive success of ""Street Fighter IV,"" the genre that, for the longest time, was in its death throes, is now enjoying a new lease on life. Tournaments are raking in huge numbers, publishers are pumping out fighter after fighter, and, most importantly, we're getting a wider variety to choose from. And of course, when the proverbial well starts running dry, publishers dig a little bit below the surface, in hopes of finding just a tad bit more juice to make a profit from. Thus, we get ""Arcana Heart 3: LOVE MAX!!!!!,"" a follow-up to a 2008 game that I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who actually bought. But I digress.The ""Arcana Heart"" franchise, as a whole, has a very simple conceit. Do you like sparkly anime girls? Do you like fighters? If so, this is the game where both of them meet in the most hilarious, over-the-top, and just a tad bit stupid way possible. Every female character stereotype to grace modern anime is unabashedly on display here. You have your underage cute one, your spunky one full of pluck, your ""tsundere,"" your ""yandere""... really, truly, if you're a completely anime nut, and those last two words mean anything to you, you'll instantly recognize these types of characters. It's a franchise that knows its audience and isn't ashamed to pander to them blatantly. In a way? It's admirable.And I say that with pure sincerity. While the story is practically non-existent, (Japan's going to get destroyed? Demons? Monsters?) the way the roster of fighters is portrayed is surprisingly refreshing. Look, this isn't the bastion of great female characterization. I'm not trying to say that. But despite the pandering to ""moe"" tropes, combined with the preposterous bust sizes of some characters, everything in ""Arcana Heart 3"" feels very fluffy and innocent. It doesn't have the creepy, leering vibe I typically get from something like the later ""Dead or Alive"" entries, or even the otherwise fun ""Dragon's Crown."" Yes, there are cute and sexy characters, but the game doesn't dehumanize and fetishize them to an absurd, almost perverse degree. They're eye candy, if you're into that sort of thing, but not in a way that makes it feel sleazy. These days, in an age where we're getting a game about sexually punishing women in order to ""correct"" them (killer Vita exclusive of 2015, folks!), that's a definite plus.Getting off my soapbox now, I'm sure most people reading this are mainly concerned about the fighting mechanics. Quite frankly, ""Arcana Heart 3"" represents my personal favorite type of fighting game. There's a very generous learning curve when it comes to getting the mechanics down, and players aren't thrown into a confusing, jargon-heavy fray, an unfortunately commonplace trend present in recent games like ""Killer Instinct."" A casual player will be able to pick up this game and have a fun time learning the special moves, getting a feel for all the different characters (more on that in a moment,) and just plain relaxing with some one-on-one battles. It isn't a daunting, terrifying prospect, picking up this game. Instead, it's a welcoming environment for people who aren't as experienced with the genre. While more competitive players might demand something more, this game firmly fills the void for everyone else, which isn't an easy task.What's also not an easy task is the process of having a roster in which every character has a unique feeling, Even the biggest games in the genre eventually have characters that have a large degree of ""same-ness."" Not so here, which is a trend carried over from the stellar first entry. In terms of animations and playstyles, pretty much all of the characters feel completely different. Sometimes, it's subtle, from the speed of attacks to the rate of movement. Others, it's signified by a huge physical difference, such as a girl riding a giant mech (!) or a toddler commanding a hulking chalk beast (!!!). Everyone controls and feels different, and it shows, even when some of the button combos do run together.Speaking of button combos, that's one thing that may be a hit or miss, depending on who you are. Unlike a game like, say, ""Tekken"" or ""Soul Calibur,"" in which everything is based on damage derived from physical blows, ""Arcana Heart 3"" is very much based on learning special moves and spamming them. While some of these special moves can vary, depending on which Arcana you equip your fighter with, the fact remains that this isn't a ""walk up to a foe and kick/punch/grab them."" Yes, there's definitely some of that at play, but you'll mainly want to stick with throwing out special attacks and stringing them together. The good news is that, like I mentioned above, the actual learning curve for these moves is very forgiving, and you'll be able to enjoy the whole thing at your own pace.As far as gameplay is concerned, ""Arcana Heart 3"" is a light, fun time that's accessible to just about anyone. On top of that, there are plenty of characters to choose from, each with their own mini-story, and a wealth of modes on top of multiplayer to dig into. It's fun, it's simple, and you won't get bored quickly.Visually, I'm a sucker for everything here. While the 4:3 aspect ratio on the beautiful widescreen OLED Vita screen is almost a crime, the game's actual aesthetic is great. It's all gorgeous 2D sprites fighting it out in backdrops that look ripped straight from an anime, lending an air of authenticity to its ""anime stereotypes come to life"" atmosphere. The game is full of bright, warm colors that make it downright relaxing to look at, and give the whole thing a welcoming vibe. On top of that, the animations for all the women and girls here are expressive and varied, as mentioned above, and help keep them all distinct from each other. Rounding it all out is a great framerate and easy-to-navigate menus, making it a win in the visuals department. While I'm not quite sure why the game's loading times are quite as long as they are, I'm not losing any sleep over it when everything looks and performs this good.""Arcana Heart 3: LOVE MAX!!!!!"" has a stupid title and isn't for everyone. If you don't like fighting games, or anime isn't your cup of tea, you probably won't get or enjoy this. For those that this game is intended for, though, it's a wonderful time. There's hours of content, on top of the infinite appeal of playing with others, and it all looks and sounds and feels great. PS3 or Vita, this is definitely a fine fighter if you're looking for something accessible and relaxing, and is something that I plan on sinking a lot of time into in the coming months.Pros:- Fun and accessible for all interested parties.- A great art direction.- Every fighter feels distinct.- Feels like an anime stereotype simulator, in the best way possible.Cons:- Some oddly long loading times in places.- Limited appeal due to subject matter and genre.- 4:3 aspect ratio is bad and the developers should feel bad.Overall: 8.25 (Groovy)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSY1D2ZISK08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXDJSFS#wasThisHelpful","RPSY1D2ZISK08","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EA and Activision get a lot of hatred for their corporate practices, and for good reason most of the time, especially in the case of the former. But to me, no publisher has earned a right to be loathed more than Ubisoft. The French corporation routinely shows off doctored footage at gaming conventions, forces players to install their third-rate Steam knock-off to play PC games, releases broken products that require numerous patches, and worst of all? They publicly defend themselves. On more than a few occasions, higher-ups have come out and defended glitches and low frame rates, trashed consoles because they allegedly couldn't handle their games, called their products ""too innovative,"" said that female animations in games were too expensive... the list goes on. No other game company has dared to defend their own B.S. so loudly, so blatantly, so obnoxiously.And now, after months of trying to defend various issues with it, trying to explain away potential issues, they've released a game that stands a testament to their practices. ""Assassin's Creed Unity"" is a glitchy, broken game with fundamentally awful design choices, tied together with a contrived story that goes nowhere and does nothing. In a year of hyped games failing to deliver, ""Unity"" not only fails, but doesn't even try. At no point in this game does it feel like anyone actually cared about it during the development cycle. Instead, it feels hobbled together and rushed out to turn a profit, complete with several, several options for micro-transactions. Honestly? It's absolutely disgusting, and has further convinced me that the AAA industry is continuing to dig its own grave.The first warning sign? ""Unity"" has a plot that could be called uninspired at best, shallow at worst, and a lazy joke if I was feeling particularly mean, which I am considering people have been duped into spending sixty bucks on this turkey. Arno is a Frenchman whose father dies,  has a tragic love interest, is motivated by revenge, must become an assassin, blah, blah, blah. Look, you've played this game before. ""Black Flag"" took some incredibly savvy and innovative steps towards a new direction for the franchise, but this? This is the same gunk you've been fed from the first moment you took control of Altair. It's the same cocky, sarcastic lead we've seen in Ezio, the same supporting cast we've seen in most other games... it's all the same. It ignores the fact that this franchise has housed Aveline Du Grandpre and Edward Kenway, two of my favorite protagonists in recent memories, and gives us a boring, stale, stubble-faced white dude with no original personality. Yes, there are the token historical figures thrown in, but they're just... there. Just another box to be checked.So, yes, the narrative here is an abysmal failure. All of the intrigue built up by the exhilarating climax of ""Black Flag"" has been thrown out in favor of a more streamlined, more casual direction, and the whole experience is worse off for it. The sci-fi sub-plot is worse than it has been in quite some time. The excuse for why we're playing yet another white guy is lazy and hokey. Everything here is just present to give us a reason to go kill people and explore another period of time in the past. It's not substantial. It doesn't matter. It's irrelevant drivel, and honestly, you could do yourself a favor and skip most of the cutscenes.What do you have to look forward to, though, after said cutscenes? After the disgustingly long load times? Well, you have some of the most egregiously broken controls this side of... actually, there's no comparison. As far as top-tier, big-name titles go, this takes the cake for terrible design and unresponsive control. Arno handles like an erratic child covered in some hybrid of both molasses and olive oil. That is to say, he sometimes sticks to things and refuses to move, but will also slip right off the side of a building and plummet to his death. He'll take a huge leap when all that's needed is a tiny jump. He'll clip right into scenery and refuse to move. This is a character who is actively a chore to control, and even when you can manage it, you'll never feel truly in control. Part of this is the unpredictable nature of his movements, part of it is the camera that will get stuck in the worst possible positions and get you killed repeatedly.That last problem is painfully obvious in the combat which, by the way, is uniformly awful. Sneaking around and killing people is a miserable experience, thanks to aforementioned broken climbing mechanics, erratic enemy AI and inaccurate targeting. Getting in sword fights is truly unpleasant, as Arno's swings constantly miss, his parries barely work, his finishing animations trigger while five feet away from an enemy that has already dodged... the list goes on. And the ranged combat? Well, I mean, it works. You point, you shoot, people die. But it lacks panache or maneuverability, and thanks to the artificial difficulty of large enemy encounters, you'll probably want steer clear of using guns altogether.But say you really want to keep playing this game, you cheeky masochist, and you're having a hard time. Then, boy, does Ubisoft ever have the perfect solution for you! DLC is available right in the pause menu, because they care so much about making it a fun experience! And not just any DLC, no, they're too far gone for that. At any point, you can buy both in-game currency and ""time-saver packs."" In-game currency lets you buy stronger weapons and gear, and you'll need it, because you don't get nearly enough to get some of the better in-game stuff by completing missions and side activities. On the same token, ""time-saver packs"" let you upgrade Arno faster, get more resources, and other things that should be able to be accomplished entirely without the usage of your wallet... considering, you know, you just spent sixty bucks on this and everything.Yes, folks, this is it. This is what Ubisoft has been working towards. Purposefully underpowering your character, in your single-player game, with their seeming intent to make you pay more money to make your experience less painful. It's a disgusting, cynical move, one that undermines whatever credibility they had to begin with. Frankly, any self-respecting consumer should boycott this company for this game alone. They release a broken game, then expect you to pay more money to have more fun with it? No, I'm sorry. That's not how that works. You're supposed to give me a game that stands alone, and then, later down the line, I'll give you more money for thoughtful supplementary content. This? This is reprehensible to its very core. This is taking the model of a ""freemium"" mobile game and applying it to a full-price console game. It's what outspoken critic and personal role model, Jim Sterling, calls ""fee-to-pay."" As in, you've already paid money, and they want more because, hey, why not? Why not? Because it's sick. And gamers deserve better.And when I say this game is broken, like I have several times, I'm not just talking about the gameplay or the micro-transactions. This game looks like trash. Occasionally, there are some pretty lighting effects, and the main character animations admittedly have a surprising level of expressiveness... in cutscenes. But for the most part, Paris looks like a muddy, muddled mess of repeated textures and jittery animations. Nothing more than 20 to 30 feet in front of Arno is rendered right, and even then, it will routinely flicker in and out of existence. Clothing and scenery pop in at random, groups of the same NPC walk together in droves, grass and water look flat and colorless. Oh, yeah, and that 30 FPS frame rate Ubisoft was so proud of? Practically non-existent. The frame rate is sometimes so appalling that the whole world will freeze for a few seconds, even in places where there's barely anything on the screen. It's wildly inconsistent, and sometimes makes the whole thing downright unplayable when coupled with the bad controls.I don't have much else to say about ""Assassins Creed Unity,"" other than that I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that anybody looked at this game and decided that it was functional and ready for store shelves. It needs at least another year of work done on it, and even then, the abysmal plot and immoral DLC options would still hamstring the entire experience. In 2014, I'm confused how a buggy piece of garbage like this got shoved out the door and put into people's consoles and PCs. I'm confused that Ubisoft thinks they can keep doing stuff like this and expect to keep customers. I'm just... confused. Confused and very, very angry.Almost anything would be a better use of money than this. Don't make the same mistake I did.Pros:- Story has potential- Paris is a neat settingCons:- Gameplay is broken- Narrative is broken- Graphics are broken- Physics are broken- DLC practices are broken- Virtually everything is brokenScore: 3 (Offensive To The Senses)","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TPEZRJK62DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48MUS4#wasThisHelpful","R35TPEZRJK62DW","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewing a Call of Duty game is a slippery slope these days, more so for high-profile critics than independent bloggers like myself. Still, though, your opinion about an entry in Activision's unstoppable juggernaut of a franchise will earn you the damnation of one crowd and the adoration of another. It's become such a stigmatized series. If you like it, you're a ""casual"" or a ""dudebro"" or a ""fake gamer girl"" or a this or a that. If you hate it, you're a ""snob"" or an ""elitist,"" so on, so forth. There's barely any in-between, I've noticed, which is really sad. A first-person shooter franchise with some genuinely good games in it has become an example of exactly what's wrong with the gaming community. That is to say, a lot of anonymous people on the internet shouting their opinions at one another as if they are objective facts.And with another year comes another entry. The proverbial wheel keeps on turning.Ladies. Gentlemen. Everyone else. I present to you ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,"" what feels like the 3,857th entry in the span of less than a decade. But as we saw with last year's Ghosts, which was a festering heap of generic garbage masquerading as a video game, not all COD entries are made the same. Something about that game cemented many people's beliefs, myself included, that it was time to throw in the towel. Everything, from top to bottom, reeked of desperation, of a cynical attempt to churn out a product in order to satisfy a sales quota. But the problem, it seems, was not with the franchise itself, but the developer. As time has shown, Infinity Ward is a developer that only knows one or two notes, lacking any sort of vision or creativity. Leave it to new blood Sledgehammer Games to return the series to a standard that, I would hazard to say, can compete with the big-league AAA titles. In fact, I'd go a step further and call this one a genuinely good game, if not a great one.As you're probably aware of by now, ""Advanced Warfare"" takes place in the future and has Kevin Spacey in it. That's pretty much the only look at it we've gotten from commercials, on top of some robots and drones and other futuristic stuff that the franchise has implemented before. The thing is? This is the first entry that everything fits together. There are no oddly outdated things standing in stark contrast to these shiny new toys. Miraculously, everything fits together to form a coherent, cohesive future, one that feels consistent in its presentation throughout the entire experience. From the multiplayer to the surprisingly entertaining campaign, everything feels like it has genuinely been ramped up to the next level, perhaps in fear of falling to other big sci-fi shooters, like Titanfall and the other big 2014 Activision shooter, Destiny.But ""Advanced Warfare"" actually has a massive edge on both of those titles. How? Because it actually feels like somebody cared about this game as both a standalone product and as an ongoing online title. See, ""Titanfall"" and ""Destiny"" failed because they didn't seem to have a firm grasp on the idea that, hey, maybe people don't want to spend sixty bucks for an online-only game with no substantial single-player content. Now, I'm not saying that this title's campaign, as good as it is, is ideal single player content. It's not. It can be cleared in 6-8 hours, if even that. But in that 6-8 hours, there's variety. There are new ideas. There are interesting characters, despite the glut of walking cliches still present. It's the video game equivalent to a blockbuster Hollywood film, but one of the good ones. If you're not into the multiplayer side of things, there is something on this disc that will still be good four, five, six years from now. That's more than I can say about the other two ""competitors.""And to be fair, some real effort went into this campaign, especially the performances. Kevin Spacey is wonderfully hammy as a mysterious head of a sinister corporation. His mocap performance is quite good, and avoids any of the creepy, uncanny valley aspects that are present in a game like Beyond: Two Souls. The other actors, including Troy ""I'm taking over video games"" Baker, are also pretty fantastic, their delivery impeccable, their facial expressions distinctly human in their variety and complexity. Also, there's a franchise first in Ilona, an ex-Spetznaz woman who you partner up with in a few missions. Yeah, Advanced Warfare is still very much a male-driven game, but it's nice to see a lady who isn't sexualized get in on the action and be an important character based on her own autonomous decisions. Kudos to the writers for doing something a little different there.The story itself, carrying you a wide variety of locales to partake in different tasks, is interesting but flawed. For my purposes, the vision of the future was convincing, and the dynamic between a large private military versus a national army that occurs was relatively compelling. There are some intriguing geopolitical questions that get raised in the narrative... and then either dropped or hamfisted away by grating patriotism. Despite all the attempts at trying new stuff, the narrative still falls into the trappings of ""gruff man who loses a best friend,"" or ""war isn't pretty but we need it,"" or ""questioning the status quo leads to evil."" It feels like the writers wanted to flex their muscles, but Activision came down hard and neutered what could have been a complex, thought-provoking title. The final result is an engrossing world with a flimsy structure, primarily populated by stock characters that are still somehow compelling. Again, very much a traditional Hollywood type of story.But for those of you who don't care about the campaign (your loss,) the signature multiplayer returns. It's... well, it's largely the same kind of game we've been playing since 2007, but I guess if it isn't broken, don't fix it? To be fair, though, the tweaks added help make it something that I find myself drawn to, more than I have since the original Black Ops. I may go one step further and say this is the multiplayer at its finest, and even if it won't win over many longtime naysayers, people who like this sort of affair will come away pleasantly surprised, and might even keep their copy around for some time to come.This is where it really comes up to a matter of personal taste. Having already sunk a good deal of time into the multiplayer within a day or two, I can see myself playing this well into next year, maybe even paying for new maps as they become available to me, and (in an extreme case) until the next entry comes out. This is a rarity in a game, considering I almost never buy DLC of any sort, including the story-based variety. That being said, I understand some people won't be impressed by the changes. Yes, you can use your Exo Suit to boost around the map or double jump, but it is still very much the same type of game consumers have gotten used to. And if you're looking for something different in that regard, then, well, wait for the next Battlefield or something. ""Advanced Warefare,"" as stated above, isn't going to bring in a ton of longtime detractors (who have legitimate reasons for disliking the series,) but it sure is a blast for fans of fast, frantic shooters.Whether you like the series or not, though, you have to marvel at the technical side of things. This is one of the most beautiful games I've played so far in this console generation, so if you have a PS4, Xbox One (or, y'know, a good PC,) you won't be disappointed in the graphics department. The character animations are excellent, the environments are lush and brimming with life, the weapons are ornately detailed. Everything has minimal aliasing, and despite the occasional area with glaring texturing laziness, generally places where we're obviously not supposed to be looking, it all looks fantastic. Perhaps it's not as top-notch as ""Tomb Raider,"" or as imaginative as ""Bayonetta 2"" or ""Super Mario 3D World,"" but it's still nothing to sneeze at.""Nothing to sneeze at"" might be the best way I could describe ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare."" It's a fast, furious, futuristic shooter with tight gameplay and some nifty technical bells and whistles. Sledgehammer Games (along with the two other co-developers working on multiplayer) remembers how to make a compelling, addictive shooter with substantial content both online and off. While it might not be the absolute best shooter this year, or even remotely close to the best game this year, it's enough to keep me snared in the multiplayer for some time to come... which is more than I could say for Destiny.It's a fun game that represents the best Call of Duty has been in years, and for many, that'll be enough reason to put forward their sixty bucks. Well, that, or Kevin Spacey's performance that's great for all the wrong reasons.Pros:- Tight gameplay- Pretty graphics- Campaign isn't trash- Multiplayer is addictive, rich in content- Kevin Spacey plays Kevin SpaceyCons:- It's still Call of Duty- The soundtrack is garbage- Narrative hiccups stunt the story- Zombies being cut off for DLC is sleazy... just sayingScore: 8.0 (Groovy)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277DONM0H7NXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K31C478#wasThisHelpful","R277DONM0H7NXT","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was somewhere between riding a flaming unicorn through the underworld and surfing on a jet through hoards of angels and demons that something hit me. Throughout my entire playthrough of Platinum's much-anticipated ""Bayonetta 2,"" there was not an instance in which I felt the game peaked. Most good modern games have a peak moment, a moment where everything works and the experience is a breathless, exhilarating thrill ride. Everything after that, nothing is quite the same. Yeah, the rest of the game is good and all, but it never reaches the crescendo that one moment managed to hit. It's unreasonable to expect that most games would be good throughout the entire thing, though. After all, barely anything can be entirely good, through-and-through, right?That's what I thought, anyway. But Hideki Kamiya and company have proved that assumption wrong for the first time in many, many a year. There is no downward spiral in ""Bayonetta 2,"" no definitive ""this is it moment."" That sensation of peaking, of a dramatic climax, begins when the first cutscene appears, and only lets up when the last credit rolls. The whole game is a non-stop thrill ride that constantly trumps itself, what with the ridiculous set pieces, gawdy comedy, flawless controls, fantastic aesthetics... the list goes on. The point is, Nintendo has put out not only put out my top contender for Game of the Year, but perhaps a modern classic as well.You would be fooled to think that by the plot. Not that it's bad, per se, but like everything else on display here it is a display of utter ridiculousness. Bayonetta's former rival and now bestie Jeanne has her soul dragged to the depths of the underworld, and the titular witch has to go all ""Dante's Inferno"" and rescue her. But there are complications, like a Yugi Motoh wannabe complete with a pyramid necklace and magical cards, and the fact that both demons and angels are now attacking the stylish witch. Within the first few chapters, everything about the narrative goes completely off the rails (if there were any rails to begin with) in the best ways possible, and the player is just supposed to accept the insanity inherent in the narrative and roll with it.They'd be behooved to do that, because once you accept Kamiya's unique brand of madness, you're in for a real treat. The narrative might not win any awards or be lauded for its emotional resonance, but boy, it sure is a good time. Part dimension-bending epic, part farce, ""Bayonetta 2"" is a game that isn't concerned with consistency of tone or tasteful subject matter. Instead, it's a delightful carnival of unfettered violence and sexuality, reveling in its own farcical nature. It's the antithesis to every grim, brooding game with gritty, gruff white dudes spouting generic tough-guy dialogue. Good-natured and earnest in its attempts to stay ""over-the-top"" at all times, this game is one that I would fervently recommend to anybody looking for one of the most genuine, anti-""big box game"" experiences out there.A lot of this is due, in part, to Bayonetta herself. Some people have some issues with her characterization and portrayal, and I honestly understand that. There are some points of the game in which she's blatantly sexualized, and a post-credits pole dance sequence is a bit on-the-nose and lacking the fun punch of the dance sequence in the last game. ""Good"" objectification is still objectification, and it should be acknowledged. But do I feel like this is a harmful depiction of a woman? No. Not in a million years. Bayonetta is actually one of the most fiercely independent, in-control leading ladies in gaming, and that sentiment is only backed up by this game. All of the men in the game are forced to play second-fiddle or fill the ""support role"" that women are usually relegated to in modern games, and to me, that's a pretty cool thing. On top of that, here's a woman completely in control of her sexuality, and literally wielding it as a weapon. We live in a society where women are frequently made to feel awful about displaying their sexuality, made to live in fear of expressing themselves. Bayonetta is a fictional character, but I feel portrayals of women like this are important. It can serve to remind smaller-minded men that women can be fierce, in-control, and independent. So while I acknowledge that some aspects of her portrayal can fairly be criticized, I feel that it's good to have female characters like this... just so long as there are other, non-sexualized female characters (Amanda Ripley, Noriko, Rubi Malone, or the modern Lara Croft, for example,) to supplement her.Onto the gameplay side of things, if you've played the first entry in this series, you know what you're getting into here. It's a combo-heavy action game that punishes players for mindlessly button-mashing. You're forced to learn the intricacies of the combat, get the hang of the ins and outs of how each weapon works, master the ""Witch Time"" dodging mechanic. Timing and precision  are everything, but it never feels too daunting; once you find a few combos that work for you, you'll be able to chain them together ad naseum to slay monsters and rack up some points. Despite this being a sequel, I actually feel like this is the easier game to be introduced to the series with. It's far less punishing than its predecessor, and good deal shorter as well. Also, the difficulty is adjustable at any time, so if you're having trouble, or if you find to be a bit too easy at times, there are options.What I think struck me most about the gameplay here is the way it feels. Recently, I played the much-lauded ""Shadow of Mordor"" and found it to be a boring, monotonous clone of other, better games. But the most egregious error, I felt, is that I was constantly aware that I was pressing a button. At no point did the barrier between me and the player-character break, and eventually, I gave up in frustration thanks the mindless repetition that punctuated the experience. Not so with ""Bayonetta 2."" Yes, you have to learn button presses and combos, but when you're executing them, you almost forget you're playing a game with a controller. It feels like you have control over Bayonetta's limbs, that you're in the game, dodging and slashing and shooting. Out of all the games I've played since I started gaming over a decade ago, I can count the ones that made me feel this in control on a few fingers. In terms of that illusive feeling of being truly immersed in a game, ""Bayonetta 2"" hits that perfect sweet spot.The beautiful graphics help with that sensation of being sucked into the game world. I've said this before, and will say it so long as people denounce the Wii U as an underpowered console for kids, but this system is capable of producing some beautiful visuals. Some of the most ""next-gen"" experiences I've had, graphically, have come out of this system, and this is coming from somebody who owns a PS4 and a moderately powerful computer. It's not about fidelity or resolution or pixel count; it's about the imaginative landscapes rendered with bright colors and unique set pieces. ""Bayonetta 2"" is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, even if it doesn't have 1,293x anti-aliasing or consistently 60 FPS, but because it actually feels like the developer put some thought into. Compare this to the supposedly ""next-gen"" games coming out this month that all look suspiciously like the same grey-and-brown tripe we've been getting served for the past few years. Processing power means absolutely nothing if you can't put it towards anything original and cool-looking, and ""Bayonetta 2"" drives this point home with gusto. It's pretty and imaginative, simply put. Enough said.That really is enough said about this game, because I can't put into words how astounding it truly is. While playing I flashed back to years ago, when the game industry wasn't as blatantly about cash-grabs and competitor-bashing, and was more focused on unique, quality titles that were significantly different from each other. There's no DLC in ""Bayonetta 2,"" no micro-transactions, no sleazy membership required to play. Every bonus item, every costume, every weapon is all there to be unlocked not by your money, but by your time, patience and skill. It's love letter to the way video games used to be, filled with interesting characters, tons of content, and fun gameplay taking place across numerous imaginative worlds that are unlike anything in real life.Every moment in ""Bayonetta 2"" is a peak, a high note. In turn, the entire game is a high note for video games, and the only game this year that I feel is worthy of my highest, unreserved praise. It's a must-have, and with the original bundled in, it's a steal.Pros:- The gameplay is fantastic- Beautiful, imaginative scenery- A love letter to Nintendo and gaming in general- Bayonetta is a great character- The soundtrack is a masterpiece- The best game I've played this yearCons:- A certain character's voice acting is dubious- Bayonetta's sexualization isn't for everyone, and I respect thatScore: 10","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ST4OZQ3WLWSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC7G1WE#wasThisHelpful","R2ST4OZQ3WLWSD","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picture this. You walk into a room while a pack of murderous looters are just outside the door, ready to shoot you on site. There are two generators in this room that you have to activate, because you have to trip an emergency evacuation alarm to open the exit. But when you do this, you realize that you've also activated an android who will bash your skull open if it sees you, and attracted the attention of a vicious predator in the air vents above you. You sneak around, throwing a makeshift noisemaker to distract both your assailants, and frantically use a device to hack into the security system while they investigate the racket. Suddenly, the alarm trips. Lights flash. Everybody is aware of your presence. Frantically, you turn tail and run right into the hall full of looters. You think you're safe, that maybe they're gone. But what you didn't notice was the disgusting slime coming from a vent dead ahead. Before you know it, a Xenomorph snatches you up and everything cuts to black, all because you were too busy panicking to pay attention.This type of experience is par for the course in ""Alien: Isolation,"" the new survival horror game/apology for ""Aliens: Colonial Marines"" from Sega and Creative Assembly. There has been a lot of talk, recently, about a revival of survival horror games. But the fact of the matter is, most horror games that attempt to breathe life into the genre stumble and miss the mark way more than they succeed. They're too focused on jump scares, or letting players shoot the enemies with a huge arsenal of weapons. Even the upcoming ""The Evil Within,"" by the prolific Shinji Mikami, looks to make concessions towards modern AAA gaming, and to not be focused on true survival and true horror. Yet I'm happy to say ""Isolation,"" a licensed game of all things, is the first game in a long, long time that I've felt can truly be called ""survival horror."" As in, you're trying desperately to survive, and dear lord, is it horrific.Part of that horror comes from the inspiration behind the game itself. It's made very clear that this game is not inspired by ""Aliens,"" James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's original ""Alien"", which most games in this franchise have been based upon. No, what we have instead is a quasi-sequel set after the events of the first film, when space marines weren't a thing and Xenomorphs weren't being overpowered by giant robotic suits. It's just the player, taking the role of series heroine Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda, one Xenomorph, and an army of assailants both human and cybernetic. She's searching for answers to her mother's disappearance after the events of the first film, and gets roped into exploring a derelict space colony formerly owned by Seegson, a second-rate corporation with big dreams and shady practices. But those answers will have to come later, with everything and seemingly everyone in the colony working together to kill her in the worst ways possible. And, y'know, the aforementioned Xenomorph doesn't help at all.Some critics have questioned the significance of ""Isolation""'s narrative, and I can't see why. I would actually say this is one of the best additions to the series canon in a long while, and certainly an improvement on the narrative roadkill that was ""Colonial Marines."" It expands upon the ""Alien"" universe in a myriad of new, intriguing ways, in my opinion. The most major of these would be the introduction of Seegson, whose turbulent history and unsavory behavior is chronicled through various logs throughout the game. Theirs is a story of corporate espionage and broken promises that helps to paint a fuller picture of the effects both space colonization and the reach of the sinister Weyland-Yutani Corporation have had on humanity. Long story short? They're the cheap knock-off of their bigger and better competitor, and throughout the game, that shows in various ways that I wouldn't dream of spoiling.Another way that this expands on series canon in important ways is the development of Amanda as a character. Previously, she had been mentioned only as an already-deceased old woman in ""Aliens"" after her mother woke up from cryo-stasis, and thus, seemed like an insignificant footnote to the Ripley bloodline. But here, we get to see her as much younger, less dead entity. It's a good thing, too, because Amanda Ripley is one of the more memorable female characters I've played as in a video game, period. Much like her mother, she may be thrown into several horrifying and deadly situations, but she's never playing the victim. By her wits, determination, and physical strength, she always has the leg up on the opposition... it's just up to the player to figure out exactly how. Add on a fierce sense of dry wit and a rugged determination to get what she wants, and you've got one of the best characters of 2014 so far.None of the important narrative choices would matter, though, if the game itself wasn't fun to play. And in some ways, it isn't... in the absolute best way possible. ""Isolation"" is a brutal, unforgiving game in which players need to get used to dying, restarting, and then dying shortly thereafter. Despite the way some trailers make it look, this is not a first-person shooter. There are guns, yes, and occasionally you'll have a use for them... when they're not attracting other threats which no weapon can kill. See, this is a survival/stealth game, in which players need to stick to the shadows and air vents if they want to actually get through the whole experience in one piece. Every situation is a puzzle, in a way, and using a gun (outside of certain situations) is a form of desperate resignation, because it indicates that you can't think of any other way to solve that puzzle. And in all likelihood, there's an answer that you're just overlooking.To compensate for barely any ammo and purposefully ineffective weapons, there's a wealth of scrap materials laying around the colony to make some useful survival tools. A molotov cocktail will scare the Xenomorph back into the vents for some time, for example, and a noisemaker will make any attackers look elsewhere while you give them the slip. Scavenging for raw materials to craft new items is not a feature, it's a necessity. Having to do it in real time also adds to the tension, as you cross your fingers that won't get mauled while trying to make something to heal yourself. With severely limited slots and the requirement of total stealth to effectively craft, ""Isolation"" really drives home the survival aspect of survival horror, and it's a joy to experience. A tense, stressful kind of joy, yes, but a joy nonetheless.But what about the horror side of things? The game may be hard and push a focus on terse survival situations, but is it actually scary? It would be an understatement to say ""yes"" to that question, because ""Isolation"" is downright terrifying at times, and simply mildly terrifying the rest of the time. Most horror games fail to scare me these days. ""Amnesia"" is more frustrating than scary, ""Outlast"" wore out its welcome halfway through, ""Slender"" is a gimmicky festival of jump scares... frankly, none of these supposedly ""scary"" games successfully shake me up. At most, they'll just startle me for a few moments, and then I'll just go about my merry way. Not so with ""Isolation."" Death is a constant threat here.The unnerving androids dubbed ""Working Joes"" are what really do it for me, to be honest. Their glowing eyes, expressionless faces, and vague threats freak me out, as do their ability to pursue you while on fire and melting right before your eyes. If you get anywhere close to them, they'll lift you up and start throttling you without a moment's hesitation. Quite the disturbing experience, especially when you consider that only a few things can actually do damage to them, like a shotgun blast to the cranium. They'll grab your melee attacks, walking through your flamethrower, take five or six shots to the head with a pistol... unexpectedly, the original foes that Creative Assembly are the most interesting enemies in the game, and are sure to keep me looking over my shoulders for quite a while. Thanks, guys!Which isn't to say that the Xenomorph itself isn't enough to make me yelp out loud, because it is. As I mentioned above, death is an ever-looming threat, and that's thanks to the creature. It will stomp around on the floor, go through the vents, rip you out of hiding places, and just about anything else in its power to end you. And rest assured, it will end you. Unlike the Working Joes, there's no chance for escaping this thing's grasp. Once it has you, it's over, and the amount of ways in which it can kill you is staggering. Walk under a vent with some weird liquid coming from it? You're dead. Try to outrun it once it's spotted you? You're really dead. Attempt to shoot it once it gets close enough to you? Completely and utterly dead. The only thing you can really do is use the flamethrower and molotovs to scare it away for a while, but ultimately, your best bet is to use your motion tracker and never let it even know you're there.That's easier said than done, though, thanks to the fantastic AI. As you're not the only human in the colony, the Alien will sometimes drop in and kill five or six people in a matter of seconds, then finish you off... or run away... or perhaps not even show up in the first place. 90% of the time I thought I was witnessing a triggered, pre-determined event, I was triumphantly proven wrong. The Xenomorph is dynamic and constantly moving, constantly changing up its game, and it's pretty much impossible to predict what it's going to do next. You just need to prepared when it does decide to do something, unless you want to get impaled or decapitated.These two enemy types, along with the desperate remaining humans, make the atmosphere of ""Isolation"" reek entirely of dread. Coupled with a ship that's always falling apart in some way, shape or form, and ominous lighting that made me genuinely afraid to go into certain rooms, the entire game is tense and terrifying, one of the scariest in years. Yet unlike most new horror games, players are actually given the chance to fight back and survive. You don't get a little lantern or camcorder, then thrown into the trenches. The controls are buttery smooth, the aforementioned crafting system works like a charm, and there's materials to be used everywhere if you look hard enough. Yes, death is a constant threat, but one that can always be avoided if you play it smart.My concerns with the gameplay are minimal thanks to all of that good stuff, but still worth mentioning. First off, the Xenomorph's movements can be wildly inconsistent. Sometimes, it chases you at a normal pace, and others, it's able to catch up from 40-50 feet away in a matter of seconds. It reminds me of the arbitrary way in which some characters in last place can suddenly pull ahead in a game of ""Mario Kart,"" able to somehow speed up enough to leave you in the dust thanks to video game magic. Except, in ""Mario Kart,"" you're not going to get rammed through the gut and forced to go back to the last manual save point. So while I admire the dynamic AI present with the Xenomorph, and I enjoy the sense of tension created by having no auto-saves, there are some serious balance issues that should have been addressed.Another major issue is the occasionally frustrating way in which players are lead through the game. Now, I hate hand-holding in most games, and love being forced to learn a map and explore. The thing is, the way in which players are lead through the story can be a bit confusing sometimes. In some instances, a player will have a clear blip on their radar, and then have to uncover the map as they go along towards said blip. That's fine. But then other times, players won't have the entire map yet and will be told to go places, yet they have no clue where they're going because there's no indicator on the map. Also, the different levels of maps aren't made clear in the interface, leaving it up to a player's guesswork as to which floor they're on. One might make the case that this lack of instruction makes for a more tense experience, and in some aspects, I can get behind that sentiment. At the same time, clearer directions and a better map system would have greatly benefited the experience as a whole.At least wherever you stumble next will most likely look really, really good, thanks to masterful art direction and stunning lighting. Despite some occasional sameness when it comes down to some of the predominately grey and black rooms present here, most of the colony (and other places you'll set foot on) is interesting to look at, and rendered with lovely visuals. Everything has a very nice 70's sci-fi sheen to it, what with the usage of cassette tapes and the clunky, plastic-looking structures that surround you. Simply put, it looks very much like the original film and its vision of the future, and is aided by Geiger-esque design for the Xenomorph and everything related to it. While some might say that we should be aiming to create newer-looking worlds for games, I think it's admirable that Creative Assembly tried to remain as faithful to the ""Alien"" universe as possible. It paid off, too, because almost everything looks gorgeous here, and it's easy to stop and just take in some of the scenery when you're not being hunted down.In the wake of the absolute disaster that was ""Aliens: Colonial Marines,"" I didn't see this one coming from a mile away. A developer primarily responsible for strategy games trying its hand at a first-person survival horror game? I was understandably skeptical, as were most. Yet ""Alien: Isolation"" goes above and beyond all expectations I had set forth for it. At best, I was hoping for a mildly tense, shiny-looking game that was predominately linear and eventually turned into a form of a shooter. Instead, I got an extremely disturbing experience which is impressively open-ended and focused on stealth over brute force. For people who want to be led through a series of jump scares and then patted on the back, this is a horrible experience. But for people who want a game that demands thought and requires strategy, and features scares that will last long after the credits roll, it's a pure triumph.""Alien: Isolation"" is a new benchmark in survival horror for me, and one I doubt many games will hit or exceed for a while. Even if it does make me want to throw my controller into the TV thanks to a cheap kill sometimes.Pros:- A great story with a unique lead- Absolutely terrifying, requires lots of thought- Beautiful to look at- The score is one of the best out there- Stealth and crafting mechanics are perfect- It's a licensed game that isn't terribleCons:- Unbalanced Xenomorph AI- Occasional lack of direction- Some lazy texturingScore: 9.75","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUMJ0M420JBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I19TYW2#wasThisHelpful","RYUMJ0M420JBN","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nintendo, as of late, has been taking some interesting risks as a company. A shooter featuring an adorable cast of squid-human hybrids? Sure! An entire game focused on Captain Toad? Why not! But to me, the most unusual announcement recently was ""Hyrule Warriors,"" which is exactly what it sounds like. That is to say, a ""Zelda"" game that plays exactly like a ""Warriors"" title, albeit with a few tweaks. Would this be a simple reskin, a la the ""Dynasty Warriors Gundam"" titles, or would it bring the best of both series together in a deliciously orgasmic package? The series have very little in common, and putting them into one game sounded like the most incongruous mixture possible.Pleasingly, ""Hyrule Warriors"" represents the very best of franchises in varying capacities. Koei-Tecmo brings its satisfying core formula of ""press one or two buttons to kill hundreds of enemies in minutes,"" Team Ninja spices said formula up with gameplay mechanics that lend a distinct variety and weight to each attack, and Nintendo brings its established lore and does some really funky stuff with it, in the best way possible. These three forces collude to produce a game that is rich in content and heavy in fun, not to mention some of the most fun I've had with a co-op game in a long time.From a narrative stand-point, this is one of the more interesting ""Zelda"" titles out there. A new villain, the unrealistically proportioned sorceress Cia, tears rifts between different points in Hyrulian history in an attempt to cause disorder and steal Link's soul. This is a sinister and evil plot, yes, but it's also an advantageous one for longtime fans of the franchise. The reason? It's the perfect excuse for fan-favorite characters from different games to team up and knock down evil forces side-by-side. So, aside from a patently annoying original character (Lana, a walking anime stereotype,) players will be able to get their hands on Midna, Ruto, Darunia, and many others, anachronistically teaming up to dispatch foes both fresh and familiar.There's obviously a lot more going on in the plot, but to spoil it would be a crime. While it would be silly to say that this is one of the absolute best ""Zelda"" storylines, it's certainly one of the more interesting ones. It constantly undermines your expectations, despite some jaw-droppingly predictable ""twists,"" and does away with the traditional ""one villain"" storyline that's made of the more recent entries a bit stale. It's also a novel concept to have three different periods in history appearing at the same time and interacting with each other, something that I've always longed to see happen. While there are no real moments of emotional resonance or significant character development going on here, there's a sense of chaotic whimsy that feels really fresh and interesting. Most importantly, it avoid the pitfalls of many crossover titles, and for that, it deserves some praise.That sentiment can be echoed for the gameplay as well. Many crossover titles lose something in translation, favoring one franchise too much and the other too little, or doing something entirely unwelcome and feeling nothing like either franchise. But here, it truly feels like a wonderful mash-up between both franchises, much like this year's earlier ""Professor Layton VS Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney."" Players will hack through thousands of enemies in a fast, frantic fashion, and unleash ridiculous special moves that devastate the opposition. They'll capture bases, take on special enemies, and upgrade their gear. But on that same token, maps are sprawling and varied, peppered with hidden collectibles and chests, and many possessing a signature boss fight that can only be effectively fought with a certain item. Koei-Tecmo and Team Ninja have both brought their own things to the table, but without losing the fantastical atmosphere and sense of exploration that comes with Nintendo's flagship.There's no hurting for both variety and depth of content here, either. On top of Legend mode, which is where the narrative unfolds, there's Free Mode (a hallmark of the Warriors series) in which players can play through any story level with any character they've unlocked thus far. There's also Adventure mode, where players progress on a charming 8-Bit recreation of the 1987 ""The Legend of Zelda"" map, taking on special challenges along the way. Each mode interacts with the others, too, meaning that materials collected, characters unlocked, and levels gained in one mode count towards the other two. As if this, along with the numerous collectible trinkets and healthy catalog of unlockable music, wasn't enough, everything in ""Hyrule Warriors"" can be tackled with two players locally (one on the TV, one on the WiiU GamePad.) Playing this with a friend or significant other comes highly recommended, as it makes tackling tasks easier by leaps and bounds. One player can conquer a base while the other hunts for a Golden Skultula, for example, and both can then come together to tackle a boss. This is one of the finer examples of local co-op I've seen in recent years, and with minimal slowdown, there's no reason not to play this with another person if you can.There have been some reviews disparaging the visual quality of ""Hyrule Warriors,"" and to be blunt, they can sod off. It might not have the resolution and parity of, say, a AAA title on the PS4 or One, but for what it's trying to do, it more or less hits the mark. The maps are carefully crafted and beautifully designed, taking players from a tree-top village to the depths of ""Ocarina of Time""'s infamous Water Temple, among many other locales, some new, some fresh takes on old classics. Despite some occasional texturing issues, each map does a good job of pulling one in, especially with the usage of varied, vibrant colors. The real showstopper here, though, are the characters. Everybody on display looks absolutely magnificent, rendered with the utmost attention to detail and fluidly animated. While Cia's design reminds me of what a horny middle-school boy would create on DeviantArt, everyone else looks great. Again, this might not win any awards for sheer horsepower, and the camera could use a little work (it has the tendency to grow unfocused from time to time,) it makes up for it with style and variety.""Hyrule Warriors"" is a lovely bit of fan service to longtime fans of the ""Zelda"" franchise, packed to the brim with content (with more on the way for some time to come,) fun to play, look at, and listen to. It avoids some of the monotonous repetition that comes with certain ""Warriors"" games, and the plodding pace that comes with some ""Zelda"" titles. Without strictly being one game or the other, it somehow represents both titles at their very best, and it's quite obvious that a massive amount of effort went into making this game just right.If you have a WiiU, love ""Zelda,"" and like killing lots of things at once with friends, it doesn't get much better than ""Hyrule Warriors."" Also, you can bring down the moon from ""Majora's Mask"" and crash it into a dragon using hookshots that spring forth out of a magical abyss.I rest my case.Pros:- Polished gameplay, tons of content- A great balance of both franchises- Excellent co-op- Looks and sounds greatCons:- Camera can be wonky at times- Only three or four Zelda games are pulled from- Main campaign is a bit shortScore: 9.0","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZFFRLWAQ8U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWEHBAG#wasThisHelpful","ROZFFRLWAQ8U7","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not seen everything Destiny has to offer. I know this, for a fact. And in fact, I may go one step further and say that I will, in all likelihood, never see everything this game has to offer. Of course, part of this has to do with the absolute chore it is to get this game to get connected, stay connected, and not throw about a dozen different cryptic error messages at me. But I'll save that complaint for later. Because if Bungie's overhyped exercise in the power of marketing was worth putting up with the horrible connection issues and egregious crashes was truly a great, original game, it would be worth it. But it's not. Like many dedicated video game players expected, Destiny is not particularly an original, innovative, or even a fantastic game. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is one of the most derivative, by-the-numbers experiences I've had with a piece of software this year, held together by a half-baked story and truly awful progression.The story, what little of it is there, is a hodgepodge of cliches filled with utterly forgettable characters and needlessly convoluted terminology. What can be sussed from it is that a giant orb, known as the Traveler (it's a Bungie game, so get ready for about a zillion capitalized nouns,) appeared out of nowhere and beckoned in an era of space travel for humanity. But the Traveler itself has had enemies in its, erm, travels, and those enemies of course end up attacking humanity and ravaging Earth. What remains of humanity is on distant planets, fighting against said enemies, most of whom are comprised by the generically-named Covenent wannabes, the Darkness.All of this exposition, and so little to care about. Honestly, you can ignore most of this story and be fine. In fact, you might be better off, because it's some of the most uninspired tripe out there, and I honestly expect more from Bungie at this point. This is a studio that's been around since the 90's, giving us the Marathon and Halo games, both series that have interesting lore and compelling narratives. But here? It's the stereotypical ""humanity must survive"" narrative we've seen time and time again in games, and considering this is 2014, where games have evolved to tell fantastic narratives grounded in believable yet fantastical worlds, stuff like this holds the industry back. Simply put, the narrative content of this game is bland and intellectually offensive, and not even worth trying to put thought towards. Because it feels, frankly, like no thought was put into it to begin with.No real thought seems to have been applied to the rest of the game, either, from what I was able to play. Yes, the core gameplay is very tight, and satisfying to a degree. The gunplay is polished and snappy, the melee feels good, vehicles control like they ought to, but... something is missing. There's a certain kind of spunk the Bungie-developed Halo games had to them, a type of freshness that's almost impossible to describe unless you're actually playing it. Yet that's entirely missing here, much to my chagrin. We have a futuristic story with strange weapons, mysterious worlds, a foreboding intergalactic threat, and yet all one can muster while playing this game is a resounding ""eh."" There is nothing broken here, yet nothing particularly wonderful. It works, but it doesn't excel at its task. When you think of a typical, big-budget, stereotypical ""AAA"" shooter, well, this is it. Right here. Just with some Borderlands elements slapped onto it haphazardly.And yes, I did say haphazardly. I'm not a big proponent of Gearbox, but with the first two Borderlands, they really nailed something special. They took the addictive qualities found in dungeon-crawling lootfests and somehow translated them successfully into an open-world shooter. There were hundreds of guns, a lively world to explore, and upgrades that packed a real punch if you knew what you were doing. Bungie, knowing that they couldn't just crank out another shooter and call it a day, looked at everything that series did right and figured they could produce a carbon copy. The problem? Borderlands takes place in a living, breathing world inhabited with memorable characters and a constant stream of new and unique weapons. Destiny, on the other hand, exists in a lifeless, dull vacuum, sprinkled with a few characters whose names you'll quickly forget, along with a few guns that wholly unremarkable. Yes, there are upgrades and perks, but why bother? Their progression is incredibly limited and stunted, and can be cheesed by exploiting the patently broken leveling system. Every similarity to that other, better game is only surface-level. It is a sociopathic imitation of an established formula, going through the same routines yet failing to truly grasp what makes it work.But what really undoes Bungie's allegedly ambitious new game is the insistence of having the entire experience be online. For the uninformed (I don't blame you, Activision has done an awful job advertising this fact,) everything component of Destiny requires the player be constantly connected to the game's servers. Want to progress the stale story? Grind a few levels? Go solo for some loot-hunting? Too bad. Even if you have no interest in playing with anybody else, the game insists that players be connected to the thing like an MMO. The problem I have with this is that the game functions nothing like an MMO. There are a few players in your lobby, and every once in a while, you'll see them do something. Maybe kill an enemy or open a chest. For the most part, though, you'll be wandering the lifeless landscapes by yourself, with no need for any other players. Yeah, you can invite whatever player you run into to form a team, but that's about it. This is a game that could have easily been a single-player experience, and forcing an always-online system onto players just wanting to experience the world by themselves is a pretty scummy thing to do.Aside from the vast expanse of nothingness to explore and the limp noodle of a campaign to go through, there are some other multiplayer options. There are deathmatches, which are pretty typical affairs albeit with some neat little gadgets, and Bungie promises a future of scheduled community events, such as raids. Again, everything here works as it should, I feel, but it all ultimately comes together in something that feels very undercooked. Bungie has done multiplayer before, and honestly, they've done it in some of the best ways I've ever seen accomplished. But that was with Halo, not this. This just feels a bit forced by comparison, at least for my purposes. For my money, there are better games on the market with playable deathmatch modes, and quite frankly, better games on the PS4 if you're looking for an MMO to sink some hours into.There are very few other things I can say about Destiny without really forcing myself to try. It's pretty to look at, sure, but as I've been saying this entire write-up, there's nothing particularly engaging the aesthetic on display. There were games about space travel released several years ago with worlds that felt more like living and breathing spaces than boring plains with some stuff to jump on. Even with very polished graphics that look almost lifelike in some areas, nothing can disguise the fact that Bungie has given players a tray of plastic fruit. That is to say, it's all very pretty looking, but there's nothing to really sink your teeth into and pull you into the experience.Writing about Destiny, I can't help but get a strange sense of deja vu. They are two entirely different games, yes, but this game reminds me very much of this year's Watch Dogs. Both experiences were built up with colossal amounts of hype, using buzzwords like ""revolutionary"" and ""innovative"" to drive preorders up. But at the end of the day, neither product was anything close to what I'd call a game-changer. They're riffs on things we've seen before, and quite honestly, seen done far better. Just because we're in a new generation of consoles doesn't mean developers get permission to just hit the ""reset"" button and start again from the ground up. That's not how this works. Each console generation does not exist in a vacuum, and nobody should get a free pass to just shove something we've been playing for years in our faces and call it the next big thing.But I guess this is where my opinion of the two games differs. Watch Dogs at least tried. It was a GTA clone, yes, but it had some novel hooks and a nice world, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft has never tried their hands at an open-world crime game. But Bungie doesn't get that much lenience from me. They've been in the industry for a long time, and have been developing shooters for most of that time. They know what they're doing. And for them to put out something this poorly thought-out, this soulless? Well, it's kind of insulting. It's insulting that I ever thought that they were capable of something great beyond Halo.Ultimately, Destiny is not a bad game. But it's certainly not a good one. It's above-average, yes, and better than the last attempts at shooters Activision has published. That being said, it's still a wholly derivative start to a series that, from first impressions, is looking to be absolutely nothing special. And from the people who crafted some of my favorite console gaming experiences to date, that's a real shame.Pros:- Polished gameplay- Pretty graphics- Good soundtrackCons:- Awful plot- Progression is uninspired, dull- Always-online is unnecessary- Bungie can do betterScore: 6.0","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPFKWZE90Y7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9Y3W#wasThisHelpful","R3UPFKWZE90Y7Q","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most recent main entry in the venerable ""Ace Attorney"" franchise had one phrase uttered dozens of times throughout its hit-or-miss story: ""the dark age of the law.""  It referred to the fact that corruption in the legal system had become rampant, with forged evidence pushing forward cases in which the ""ends justified the means."" To a lesser extent, that's how I've felt about the game industry as of late. Giant games boasting most preorders in history or developed by some big, AAA studio who developed some other massive franchise are dominating the market. Trailers with gameplay that is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, fabricated and not indicative of the final product. The ends justify the means, just so long as the big companies get their profit. It's instilled me with a healthy dose of bitter cynicism about gaming in general, and for a while there, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to keep on reviewing games, or pursuing a career in that vein. There just wasn't enough to keep me going.Yet there were some bastions of hope. Some of the upcoming Fall titles look engaging, the return of survival horror into the marketplace is great, and, more related to this review, Nintendo has put up its dukes again and started pounding into the competition again. Given that I love the company dearly, and that I obviously am heavily invested in the ""Ace Attorney"" franchise, this title was always a no-brainer purchase for me. In fact, it was one of the reasons I wanted a 3DS, when it was announced way back in 2010. I didn't know how good it would be, though. In fact, I had no idea that one game could singlehandedly restore my faith in video games, and my love of them. But that's what's happening with ""Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney."" It sounds hyperbolic, but this is one of the best games I've played this year.The set-up is ridiculous and whimsical, very befitting of both franchise involved. A mysterious book owned by a girl named Espella holds the history of Labyrinthia, a sleepy town that feels straight out of a fairy tale. And indeed, Espella's book makes that seem like a likely possibility, considering it not only holds the tale of Labyrinthia's past, but of its present and future as well. In two very different capacities, Layton, Luke, Phoenix and Maya get involved with Espella, and get drawn inside of the magical tome. To their surprise, being sucked inside of the book takes them straight to Labyrinthia, which is very much a medieval joint complete with knights, cobblestone streets, and... witch trials. Yep, you see where this is going, don't you?Four rational individuals are thrown into a wildly irrational world and expected to survive. Not only that, but they're expected to go up against widespread superstition to save innocent lives, and to try and topple a man known only as the Storyteller, who is essentially a god. Will logic prevail? Will their objections be heard? Or will the future written by the Storyteller come to fruition and foil everything our heroes are working towards? The basic conflict of this game is a top-notch ""fish out of water story,"" and it's one of the best adventures any of the characters have ever had.What makes the narrative work so well is not only the core conflict of ""logic versus superstition,"" but the combination of excellent pacing and great characterization. Layton and Phoenix are entirely out of their element, and watching them try to navigate the waters of Labyrinthia's tenuous legal system is thrilling, to say the least. The horrific nature of a guilty verdict equaling instant execution is balanced out by both series' signature senses of humor, which work perfectly together. It pushes all of the characters to their logical extremes, and as somebody who enjoys both series, it's a pure joy to watch unfold. At the same time, the game's structure and excellent usage of cliffhangers makes sure that players don't get too tired of puzzle-solving or courtroom drama, breaking everything up into nice chunks that prevent tedium from setting in.The gameplay itself is a perfect combination of both series' hallmarks. Sections in which you're pointing and clicking are now not only filled with puzzles, but with clues and evidence that can be used in court. This means that you'll see Phoenix and Maya solving puzzles in the same fashion as a Layton game, as well as Layton and Luke questioning witnesses and discussing evidence in a similar way to an Ace Attorney entry. This simultaneous combination and role-reversal is the compelling kick in the pants both franchises have needed in recent entries, in my opinion, and keeps things constantly engaging.Long-time fans of the Ace Attorney franchise, the ones who expect each entry to have a cool new mechanic (Psyche-Locks, the Mood Matrix, and the like,) will be pleased to see two new features added here. It's a bit of a mixed bag, though, as one of them is a bit perfunctory, while the other is surprisingly novel and interesting. The useless one is the addition of a spell book, which the player can use to present different spells in court. We've been collecting and presenting evidence since 2005 (earlier in Japan,) though, and this just feels like another arsenal of evidence as opposed to a legitimate new feature. That being said, the second addition is having multiple witnesses on the stand at once, which is a healthy amount of chaotic fun. Different testimonies contradict each other and trigger other trains of thought of other witnesses, and it's up to the player to suss through all of these to get to the bottom of each case. It's a novel feature that could only really work in this setting, and while I'd like it to return, I understand that it wouldn't work using the modern legal system as a template. As it stands, I'm grateful for such a cool feature here, and appreciate the exciting twist on the formula it brings to the table.I would say that my biggest qualm with the gameplay is the incongruous mixture of difficulty and mollycoddling players get. I get that hint coins are an integral part of the Layton series, but I don't really feel like they have a place in Phoenix's courtroom. It's true that Ace Attorney has always had a problem of oblique answers to vague questions, but using hint coins that either narrow the evidence you can present or straight-up tell you the answer to things is not the right way to go about fixing that. Personally, I would have preferred better lines of logic instead of a cheap tactic driven by collecting trinkets which are overly abundant in the game world. That doesn't speak to the quality of the core mechanics themselves, of course, but it is something that I really take issue with. So while everything works as well as it should, some more fine-tuning of the lines of logic and less liberal application of coins would have been nice.There are no real complaints in the presentation department. In fact, this is one of the best looking titles on the 3DS in terms of pure aesthetics. Just to be clear, that doesn't mean it has the most polygons, or the most ""realistic"" appearance. Instead, its art direction can only be described as brilliant. It is a beautiful collision of both Layton and Ace Attorney's radically different styles that feels tasteful, and is aided by a fantastic presentation in the town of Labyrinthia itself. Playing video games for as long as I have, I've seen plenty of medieval villages and mysterious dungeons. Yet few of them have managed to make me feel the sense of awe and whimsy I feel while playing ""Layton vs Wright."" It's filled with several interesting characters of varying art styles that, somehow, never clash, and feel like living, breathing citizens of their world. This fantastical cavalcade of bright color is tied together by a fantastic use of 3D and smooth character animations, further drawing players into Labyrinthia. Oh, yes, and those animated cutscenes? They're easily the best either franchise has ever had.Arguably, though, my favorite part of this game is the soundtrack. Layton and Ace Attorney are both scored by some of the best in business, and have distinctive tunes which franchise fans know and love. While the primary Ace Attorney composer didn't work on this, which is kind of surprising, the main Layton composer and another famed game musician teamed up for the soundtrack this time around. The results can only be described as... actually, no description does them justice. But what I can say is that this is the best soundtrack, to any game, that I have heard all year. The light yet mysterious vibe of Level-5's games is given copious amounts of punch and spice by the signature brash and bold atmosphere of Capcom's. Musical hallmarks of both series are touched upon and messed around with in new, interesting ways, which helps drive home the fact that this is a true combination of both franchises.To me, that's what makes this a must-play. This is not a cheap crossover, an excuse to just throw a few beloved characters into a game in hopes of making a quick cash-grab, which is a shocker considering Capcom was involved. Like peanut butter and jelly, like fries and a chocolate shake (try it sometime,) this is a flavorful combination, with both tastes complementing and aiding each other to make the entire experience something that could not be replicated elsewhere. This game represents both franchises at the top of their game, no pun intended. It is both the best Ace Attorney since ""Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney"" and the best Layton since the early entries, mixed into 20+ hour experience.""Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney"" is not without its issues, but in my years of experience, no game is. As it stands, though, it's two fantastic franchises done right, thrown into one game and then put on the market at a budgeted price. For adventure game fans, it's a fantastic value and a great introduction to a cast of unforgettable characters. For fans of both or either franchise, it's everything you know and love, plus so much more. Either way, it's a fantastic game with very little hampering it from being one of this year's best.At the end of the year, after the overhyped shooters and DLC cashgrabs have come and gone, I will look back on this game still, and might even still be playing downloadable puzzles and bonus episodes. I will look back on it and remember it as the game that restored my faith in games. Not bad, huh?Pros:- A lengthy, twisty story.- Engaging, varied gameplay.- Vibrant graphics.- Beautiful, brilliant soundtrack.- Both a great starting point and a great piece of fan service.Cons:- Hint coins have no place in the courtroom.- The spell book is a useless addition.- Ace Attorney still has some oblique lines of logic.Score: 9.5","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L44XBWRQ0YZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFY04A#wasThisHelpful","R3L44XBWRQ0YZZ","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally, I went in with the lowest of expectations with ""300: Rise of an Empire."" The first ""300"" was very good for its time, an entertaining festival of unadulterated machismo and bloody carnage. Perhaps it hasn't aged very well in the seven years since its release, with its more problematic elements becoming more highlighted by the influx of action films with better female characterization, but I would still contend that it's a very entertaining, fun film. But three years shy of a decade later (god, I feel old,) why is a follow-up even remotely necessary?For much of its 100+ minute runtime, ""Rise of an Empire"" desperately tries to prove its worth to skeptics like myself, and mostly succeeds. It isn't a sequel, in the strictest sense of the word, nor is it a prequel. Instead, we have a story that takes place before, during, and a bit after the events of the first film, It follows Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton,) a blue-caped Athenian crusader responsible for killing King Darius, which in turn spurs his son Xerxes into becoming the borderline iconic villain fans remember. But while Leonidas focused on direct ground confrontation, most of the action here takes place on the high seas, pitting our protagonist against the menacing navel commander Artemisia (expertly played by Eva Green.)And when the focus is on that action, this sequel soars. The action sequences are some of the most well-choreographed I've seen all year, especially the explosive, physics-defying climax. When films have a focus on navel warfare, they often tend to drag on and becoming grandiose, budget-driven bores. But here, the script eschews typical ship battles, instead focusing on implausible yet exhilarating bits of action. Horses jump from boat to boat, ships spew oil which is of course lit ablaze, soldiers leap from masts and plunge their blades into the skulls of the opposition. If you're looking for fun swordplay and bloody chaos, few movies do it better than this.Which makes other parts of the film feel like a thundering bore. Yes, when ""Rise of an Empire"" decides to focus on political intrigue or grand proclamations of battle, it falls woefully short of the heights delivered by its predecessor. There are no ""tonight we dine in hell"" or ""this is Sparta"" moments here, only cut-rate dialogue which exists only to drive the plots. That is, when we're focused on the Athenian side of things. The characters of Artemisia and Gorgo (Lena Headey reprises her role) get the best lines, ironic in a movie so blatantly pitched towards men. But when they're off camera, which is too often, the film necessitates that Stapleton steps into the spotlight, and not to be too harsh, but the guy just can't carry a whole movie.Speaking of Gorgo and Artemisia, I have to commend Zac Snyder and Kurt Johnstead for improving the female characterization present in this series. While it's still no ""Divergent"" or ""Hunger Games,"" both of these characters get to slay the opposition and remain mostly undefined by victimhood. I also have to hand it to the movie for handling the topic of sexual assault in a non-glorified, non-sexualized manner. It's portrayed not as some forbidden vice, but as a disgusting act of subjugation and domination, which is exactly how it was implemented in the time period during which this is supposed to take place. Gone are the days of the naked, dancing oracle and Gorgo's assault in the previous film, and it shows that the franchise is willing to not entirely alienate a female audience. Good stuff. Not great, but good.What more is there to say about ""300: Rise of an Empire"" aside from that last sentiment, then? It's nothing groundbreaking, nor does it feel as innovative or original as the first film, but it constantly undermines the viewer's doubt in it being a worthy addition to the series canon. It may get dull at times, but the action sequences and great performances from Green and Headey, paired with Junkie XL's excellent score, manage to save the film from complete mediocrity. This won't win over people who don't like this sort of film, but for fans of the original or people looking for a high-flying action experience, it's a solid bit of entertainment that'll probably be worth your time.Grade: B-","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYM3YELME6E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8OBCQS#wasThisHelpful","R3DYM3YELME6E8","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when you give an American studio and the ""God of War"" writer access to a cult favorite Japanese property? I was hoping for something good, really. The first two ""Appleseed"" movies are much better than some people give them credit for, and I'm always sure to recommend the first one to those looking for a fun, futuristic thrill ride. It looked, from the trailers, like the prequel was on track to have an interesting set-up for the franchise coupled with some beautiful animation. Still, there were warning signs, like Deunan's absolutely moronic costume change to the unfortunate choice of generic, dated dubstep. I held out hope, and was promptly shot in the foot.Without any exaggeration, I believe that I could fairly assert that ""Appleseed: Alpha"" is one of the worst things to happen to a great franchise since ""Metroid"" got hit by the speeding semi that was ""Other M,"" or when George Lucas thought Jar Jar Binks would be a genuinely worthy character addition to the ""Star Wars"" lore. Without trying to come across as a bitter nerd here, I'll keep details on why this is a bad ""Appleseed"" movie to a minimum, and try to focus on why this is just a bad movie, period.First off, the plot, or what little there is, is one of the most contrived pieces of drivel to be churned out by a writer this year. We see the world in ruins after World War III, and series protagonists Deunan and Briarios are travelling through a ruined New York, running errands for a black stereotype that also happens to be a robot with devil horns. Off to a great start, I know. They're searching for Olympus, this fabled Utopian society that viewers of the previous films will be all too familiar with. Somehow, they get embroiled in a conflict stemming between a mysterious pair of androids and a young girl who is apparently the key to some nefarious scheme they're hatching. Will our heroes save this young girl in a suit seemingly made of latex? Will Briarios get the help he needs to repair his cybernetic body? Can this movie get any more cliche?You probably know the answer to all three of those questions. Yes, this movie is comprised of some of the worst tropes to grace science fiction since its inception, and it doesn't use them in any original way. No unique twist or spin, just regurgitated archetypes and plot points that can be and have been executed in a far more compelling fashion. None of this is aided by the positively awful script and patently bad direction, both of which work in tandem to give the film an abundance of awful tough guy dialogue and stilted scenes rife with awkward pauses. From a narrative standpoint, this movie is positively broken down its very concept, and not at a single point did I begin to think this was a story worth telling.To add a bit of a nitpick here, the characterization of Deunan here is downright awful. Here we had a character with an excellent personality who was unafraid in the face of adversity and handy with a gun. She had practical clothing for the battlefield, and stylish clothing for going out on the town. Brash but bold, caring yet tough, she was one of the best female anime leads of the mid-2000's when the first CG ""Appleseed"" film hit. Here? She's the stage nag to Briarios, who is actually the lead here, spewing macho lines and talking with a grizzled voice about the war. Deunan barely does anything except for act as a caregiver, fire off a few rounds, and then become emotionally overburdened at the drop of a hat. This is not the character fans know and love, and while I wasn't expecting good female characterization from the writer who brought us the ""God of War"" series, this isn't mediocre. It's bad. It's flat-out bad. But hey, at least we get a scene where she cooks, and the hilarious joke is that she, in fact, is terrible at cooking! Aren't those jokes still hilarious in 2014? So fresh!Perhaps the only thing that ""saves"" this movie is the animation. I'm not going to lie here, it's what prevents me from giving this movie a flat ""F"" and going about my merry way. Make no mistake, this is a beautiful film. The characters are expressive, and the environments are very,very pretty. And on the rare occasion there's an action sequence that isn't botched by terrible direction or pacing, it can get moderately exciting for a few moments. Unfortunately, the budget sunk into it was squandered, as even the decent action sequences are very trite and worn, nothing like the high-flying, dizzying spectacles I've come to expect from this series. It's all very pretty, but very soulless and repetitive. Oh, yes, and Deunan's new costume is utterly stupid.Also utterly stupid is every aspect of the sound design here. I don't have very much to say about it, other than it's basically sewage. The voice acting is tepid and bland at best, atrocious and grating at worst. It's all uniformly bad, and the more minor the character, the worse it sounds. But honestly, it's nowhere nearly as atrocious as the music, which is a completely disorganized mess. One second it's awful dubstep, the next it's a symphonic score, then trance, then rap, and then... you get the picture. And while variety is the spice of life, there's something to be said for knowing how to blend different things together in a seamless fashion. This film does the polar opposite and suffers gravely for it.Ultimately, your enjoyment of ""Appleseed: Alpha"" will depend on how little you care about plot-to-visuals ratio. If you're the type of person who plops down money to go see a Michael Bay movie for the technical wizardry, or buys new games based on their graphical fidelity, you might enjoy this. There's nothing wrong this. I'm not one of those people, though, and that makes me the polar opposite of the type of person Aramaki and company wanted to pull a fast one over on. Banking on franchise good will and hoping to get away with just having pretty visuals, this movie falls apart the moment one begins to try and pay attention to the garbage plot, listen to the atrocious soundscapes, or expect any sort of interesting action.The bottom line? ""Appleseed: Alpha"" is a bad apple in a franchise of ripe, juicy ones, and there's no reason to give it your time. Even if it does look shiny and delicious on the surface.Grade: D+","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKE4PDRYFUWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5LXS4U#wasThisHelpful","REKE4PDRYFUWI","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original ""Robocop,"" made by Paul Verhoeven back in 1987, was a product of its era. This was a period that I wasn't alive during, but from my understanding, was filled to the brim with violent action films that oozed testosterone and viscera in equal amounts. While some of these films have aged quite well, such as ""Commando"" and ""Die Hard,"" many of them were exercises in mind-numbing repetition. But ""Robocop"" was the antithesis to this. It worked on several different levels. As a satire, it laid bare the societal fascination with hyper-violent entertainment. As an analogy, it told a biblical tale as filtered through a cynical, post-modern lens. And as a sci-fi action movie, it managed to excited and thrill with memorable sequences and set pieces galore. At the time of its release, the world needed it. It felt urgent.Which is partially why this update feels so passe. The new ""Robocop"" is a film that can't decide what it wants to be, and frantically tries on far too many hats for its own good. One moment, the audience is given a rollicking action sequence with a pumping soundtrack, and the next, a futuristic news program hosted by Samuel L. Jackson as a far-right political pundit. This is not a film that is ""one part X, one part Y""; instead, it is a film that wants to be ""parts A-Z,"" but lacks the writing and directing chops to pull it off. The result? A film that is a frantic mixture of various things that, ultimately, feels superfluous and unnecessary in today's cinematic landscape.Why, for example, do we really need a sob story about the lukewarm protagonist and his family? The original film left the titular robotic do-gooder, Alex Murphy, abandoned by his wife and son, the memories of his past life a cruel facade that gave him drive but could never be recreated. But here, we have an underdeveloped family who are supposed to act as the catalysts to him finding his humanity again, after an explosive attack on him leaves with only a head, a hand, and a robotic body. While this could be an okay plot device in a better movie, handled by capable writers, the fact remains that it is botched here. Watching these scenes that were so obviously attempting to be ""emotional,"" I wished that the film would stop its cloying attempts to tug at the heartstrings and get back to the central conflict of the movie.Which is when I remembered that there is no central conflict, yet another reason why this is a far inferior film to its predecessor. In the original, we had the menacing Clarence Boddicker, a psychotic mobster who shot up the protagonist for fun, blowing him apart limb by limb until barely anything resembling a corpse remained. To top that off, we had an entire gang of equally depraved individuals who engaged Robocop in an array of dazzling and violent action sequences. Here? We have a bloated cast of cliches parroted about like they're important or interesting. They're far from it. The bland criminal who killed Alex is barely there, and only gets brought up again in the ancillary revenge plot. There's a robot specialist cum weapons expert who also wants Alex off the streets because... he hates the idea of androids or something. And last but not least, there's Michael Keaton as the head of OmniCorp, whose character fluctuates wildly between ""rogue,"" ""greedy suit"" and ""sociopathic murderer,"" with no sense of development or rational progression of actions. There are also several sub-plots that come and go, which left me wondering which one I was supposed to really be caring about. The answer? Not many of them.It's become a common sentiment, I feel, to lash out at critics who compare the old film and the new one. I call shenanigans with that sentiment, because ""Robocop"" so desperately tries to ape the original while adding completely jarring and unnecessary flourishes that do nothing but fill the story with bloated nonsense. There are little nods and references that feel wholly out of place here, and quite honestly, undermine what could have been a good film. And make no mistake, there are flashes of compelling stuff here. Gary Oldman's tortured scientist character, in particular, is fascinating. His struggle between his humanity and his desire for technological innovation is surprisingly interesting, and provides a compelling anchor to some of the more stupid bits. On top of that, the film raises some very stimulating questions about US foreign policy, and the morality of drone warfare, not to mention the caustic nature of American imperialism and unfettered patriotism. Indeed, when this movie isn't trying to focus on sappy family bits, phoned-in action, or a perfunctory revenge plot, it actually starts to work and become compelling science fiction.That, coupled with some strong performances from Oldman, Jackson, Keaton and (shockingly) Jay Baruchel, prevent ""Robocop"" from becoming a truly bad movie. But while that may be the case, there's no denying that it's a mediocre one which lacks direction or a compelling central conflict. If you come in expecting a cohesive plot and exciting action, well, you're going to be disappointed. But if you can overlook these faults and take away some of the interesting things the writers are trying to accomplish, you may be pleasantly surprised by the genuinely engaging politics in this movie.""Robocop"" lacks the bite of the original, yes, but it's an entertaining little morsel that will make you think about some cool stuff, if only for five minutes or so. With some more polish, it could have been something special, but as it stands, it's simply worth a rent and a casual viewing. Nothing more, nothing less.Grade: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JRUQKGYQCL4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK67OQO#wasThisHelpful","R3JRUQKGYQCL4P","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some things that I review where I simply can't describe why I like them. I just do. It may be a certain trait that just plays right into an interest of mine, or an original concept that I particularly jive on. But sometimes, even that's not the case. There's no fathomable reason why I should love this thing as much as I do, yet I go and sing its praises to anybody who will listen. And so, I can't really explain why I love ""Tomodachi Life"" as much as I do. But I suspect the ability to make anime icon Lupin III and Hillary Clinton get hitched, or have Hank Hill and Sadako of ""The Ring"" infamy be best buddies might have something to do with it.""Tomodachi Life"" has absolutely no plot, and to an extent, absolutely no point whatsoever. You might think of it as ""The Sims,"" but played with Miis and done in the style of a particularly abstract Andy Kaufman gag. You either import Miis from your 3DS, create your own in-game, scan them in, or use a friend's, then put them on an island that you name. Oh, yes, that's after you customize their voice and personality. After that, you set them loose to interact with each other, solving their crises, aiding their relationships, and occasionally taking a peek into their dreams. Which sometimes involve them in humorous ""Sailor Moon"" fantasies. Or dancing and chanting in a very cult-like fashion around a miscellaneous household item. Yep.Honestly, there isn't much in the way of real, engaging gameplay, but to me, that's what makes it such a fresh experience. There are no convoluted menus. No annoying menial tasks that might take 20 minutes at a time to do. Nothing like that. ""Tomodachi Life"" is, to an extent, a life simulator for people who hate life simulators. Everything is handled with a few clicks of the touch screen, and you can either play for five minutes at a time or fifty minutes at a time. Yes, sometimes, things will repeat. A Mii will have the same dream, or a line of dialogue will be uttered twice. But having been played at a very dedicated rate for over two weeks now, I can wholeheartedly say that I am seeing new and unique things everyday still. To top it off, my partner has the game as well, and her experience has been almost entirely different from my own. To me, that speaks volumes to the quality of the game. No one copy will progress or act in the exact same way, which is more than I can say for Nintendo's other major life simulator, ""Animal Crossing,"" despite being a very big fan of that as well.But what do you do outside of creating Miis and paying attention to their needs? You'll definitely be shopping for them, whether it be hats, clothes, outlandish costumes, food, or new decorations for their rooms, which contribute to their RPG-like ""Happiness Level."" Outside of that, you can check in on them in a restaurant, send them on an 8-bit role-playing quest, watch two lovebirds chase each other down the beach, or peek in on an outdoor barbecue party. My personal favorite side-activity, and one which can certainly become a time sink if you let it, is at the concert hall. Choosing from a nice variety of musical choices, you can make Miis sing as a solo act, a duo, or a group. Best part is? You get to write the lyrics to any song and hear them sing it. They can be silly, funny, or (if you work around the censored words list, which is pretty easy) a veritable cornucopia of nonsensical raunch. This is just one of the many activities in ""Tomodachi Life"" that may seem like a silly diversion, but can quite easily keep you engaged for far longer than it should.That's something that could be said for the entire experience, though. ""Tomodachi Life"" might not be the most in-depth, realistic life simulator out there, but I don't think it's trying to be. If ""The Sims"" is the most painstaking, and ""Animal Crossing"" the lighthearted equivalent, then this is the out-of-left-field, completely off-the-rails festival of unmitigated silliness that people who just want a good laugh play. It's fun by yourself, and it's fun playing side-by-side with a friend, trading Miis and watching them interact with each other's islanders. There's no huge commitment, and you can play it every day, or quit for a month then come back to it. Honestly, this is the type of life simulator I've been waiting for, and it's the type of bizarre, risky game that I've wanted to see Nintendo make more of. Abstract in its humor, novel in its execution, this is something that I can't help but love every second of.So, like I said above, at the beginning of this admittedly short review, ""Tomodachi Life"" is something that I can't necessarily put into words. Simply put, it's just fun, funny, and most importantly, fresh. There's nothing else on the market quite like this. Any person of any age, I think, could have a blast with this. While I do think it would be nice if same-sex relationships were included, and that the default ""player hand"" that shows up sometimes could have its race customized (because, y'know, not everyone has pale skin,) I still think this is, all-in-all, a very wonderful and unique experience that almost anybody could have a total blast with.I mean, c'mon. Where else are you going to watch Duke Nukem become the most desired man on an island? Or watch yourself get into a committed relationship with a dreadheaded goth? Or see Danny Trejo role around on the floor in a sweatsuit out of boredom? Yeah. I rest my case.Pros:- A unique idea executed well.- Loads of content, and most of it is fun.- One of the funniest games on the market.Cons:- Lack of same-sex relationships sucks for those aren't straight.- Occasional repetition.Grade: 9 (Bomber)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8W8ZMEECMQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM3R6M6#wasThisHelpful","R1E8W8ZMEECMQY","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are plenty of experiences that could be called stressful, but watching something isn't usually one of them. Typically speaking, you watch something to relax, to engage your mind, to tickle some sort of fancy. But there are those rare experiences that make you cringe, make you ask more questions than receive answers, that truly unnerve and stick with you, and make you question why you're even watching the darn thing... yet you just can't get enough. And before you've realized it, your nerves are fried and you've finished whatever it is.""Flowers of Evil"" is one of those things. Easily the best psychological thriller since ""Lain"" or ""Paranoia Agent,"" and on the very same level of quality of the former, this 2013 series is one of the most controversial anime in recent history, and for good reason. It's unconventional both its approach and its execution, and by no means is this something I'd recommend to the casual consumer. It's a show for those like to question everything they hold sacred, and for those who like their viewing experiences to be the intellectual equivalent of trying to drive through a wall of molasses or glue. This is a show that is unsatisfying and impenetrable in many regards, yet on the exact same token, one that is satisfying, cathartic, and engaging.Without giving too much away, ""Flowers"" follows Kasuga, who is a painfully introverted book lover who gets a crush on the beautiful, seeming epitome of normality, Saeki. After class one, he notices she's left her gym clothes behind, and takes them home in order to keep them safe, but somebody sees him. This person is Nakamura, a young woman who can only be described an absolute, literal psychopath. She accosts Kasuga for taking the clothes, and swears that if he doesn't undergo a series of demented ""tests"" she has lined up, she'll tell the entire class that he took the clothes for some perverted purpose.This begins what is one of the most nerve-wracking experiences ever put to animation. The tests, while generally non-violent, are positively deranged in their perversity, and difficult to watch Kasuga go through for 13 episodes. It would be a real shame to spoil any of them, but I will say that they usually involve the protagonist constantly on the verge of public humiliation, or engaging in some kind of defacement of property. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this show, there ends up not being anybody you can really cheer for. As things wear on, you'll realize that no one character is actually good person. Everybody is absolutely messed-up in their own unique way, and a little more than halfway through the series, the whole experience becomes watching bad people do bad things to each other in increasingly disparaging ways. If you couldn't take the hint, this show is a giant downer, and a mentally taxing one at that. Oh, yes, and it's positively horrifying.One of the major contributing factors to this is Nakamura herself. She's a brilliant character. Everything about her oozes ill intent and sadism, yet the way she manipulates people into doing what she wants is masterful. You hate her, but you want to see how she's going to enlist Kasuga or any of the other characters to help get her way. I've been reading books, playing games, and watching things since I was essentially cognitive, and I can fairly assert that she is one of the greatest villains ever written. Every horrible thing that happens in the plot, every negative aspect of every character that gets brought to light can all be traced back to her and her actions. Nakamura is a cunning master of deceit, constantly on the verge of an angry and violent outburst if she doesn't get exactly what she wants, exactly how she wants it.What also manages to contribute to the overall atmosphere of tension and unease is the combination of bizarre imagery and the masterful usage of silence. There is, indeed, a soundtrack, quite a good and chilling one, but there are numerous instances throughout the series in which the only audible sounds are voices, background noises, or neither, for extended periods of time. This very minimalist approach also applies to the divisive rotoscoped animation, which sometimes is packed with action and unsettling, otherworldly imagery, yet sometimes is spent depicting a 12 minute walk back from school. Sometimes, the horror comes from what's occurring on screen, and others, it's based in what's inferred out of what isn't visible. ""Flowers"" is not a show that gives you things, unlike most productions in today's instant-gratification anime marketplace. Instead, it demands you to work through it, and to come to your own conclusion. And much like the works of David Lynch, or his late anime equivalent, Satoshi Kon, that mind-bending approach helps elevate it above the majority of what's released today.As mentioned above, the animation in this series is very controversial. You can find articles praising it for its artistry and ambition, but you can also find angry forums about how it's not ""real anime,"" accompanied by unfortunate screenshots that ""prove"" that the animation is ""terrible."" Note the usage of quotations. I will face rage from fellow anime viewers and say that anybody who claims that this isn't ""real animation"" is patently wrong. Yes, the characters are rotoscoped from real actors and actual locations, but so much effort went into coloring it, adding visual flourishes, and drawing the otherworldly, hallucinatory scenery that calling it anything but animation is positively foolish. Anime, by its very nature, is animation that is Japanese. It does not mean big eyes, unrealistic proportions, or ""moe"" character designs. Insisting that it should adhere to those principles limits artistic expression in a field that desperately needs it, and furthermore, is the kind of entitlement that is exactly what's wrong the anime industry.""Flowers of Evil"" is not a good show. It's not a great show. It's a fantastic show. In my 10+ years of watching anime, I haven't seen anything like it, and the stuff that's comparable came out a long time ago. It's a masterpiece, simply put. It's something that should be loved and cherished, passed down from one generation to the next like a fine work of cinema by Lang or Kubrick. It's all the things that the anime industry needs more of (risky, bold, thought-provoking,) all rolled into one. Whether you care about anime as an art form, or are simply looking for something in a Lynchian vein, this is something you simply must watch.Grade: A+","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29D7MNVS64716/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9IP7K2#wasThisHelpful","R29D7MNVS64716","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The quality of the first ""Thor"" entry is often a point of contention among a good deal of people and myself. Personally, I found Branagh's film to be energetic and lively, with a fantastic cast bolstered by solid direction and an entertainingly cheesy plot. Many people don't share that viewpoint in the slightest, I came to find out. Regardless, that didn't damper my excitement for the follow-up, which has a different director but the same writers. It's a shame, then, that after seeing this on opening night, the first phrase that came out of my mouth was, ""Well, that kind of sucked."" Because despite all of its best efforts, ""Thor: The Dark World"" suffers from a sophomore slump that undercuts any of the film's strong points.After the events of ""The Avengers,"" Thor has been patrolling the nine realms in an attempt to keep interdimensional peace. Loki has been locked in away in a cell, and Jane Foster has been... well, apparently trying to step up her dating game, despite still pining for her pretty-boy Asgardian prince. But all of this is threatened by the introduction of the Dark Elves, an ancient race of warriors whom Odin presumed to be dead after he ravaged their world with the restraint of a crazed elephant. In a predictable twist, the Dark Elves invade Asgard, kill a lot of people, and severely anger Thor and Loki to the point where they end up working together. Also, Jane gets possessed by some ancient parasitic weapon, the laws of physics start failing in London, and the Earth is on the verge of getting destroyed.As you can probably tell from my less than excited tone about the plot, this movie's narrative is a complete snore-fest when held in comparison to the first one. The writers have simply tried to tackle way too much in way too short of a running time, which results in a film that feels simultaneously plodding and rushed. Casualties of this flawed narrative include entire subplots that get introduced, then dropped with no abandon. We're supposed to be led that there's an elaborate love triangle, that Loki has some sinister plan being carefully plotted out, that physics going berserk is because of a certain reason. But when the credits begin to roll, it feels like we've only seen about 1/4 of the story. Altogether, this film feels incredibly unfocused and incomplete, and for the second time in the Marvel Universe films (the first being the ""Captain America""), it felt like I was watching a two hour trailer for the next ""Avengers"" film.The other problem with this film is the absolutely unbelievable love story. Despite both being great actors in their own right, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman simply have no chemistry together as the lovers from other worlds. When they kiss, it feels forced, and their ""romantic"" dialogue made me feel as if I was being forcefed sugar from a funnel. It's almost unbearable to watch them interact at times, which is a bit saddening when their chemistry in the first film was pretty convincing.At least the acting and fighting keep things moving along. Tom Hiddleston is especially wonderful as Loki, finally showing a commitment to the role that I quite frankly didn't know he had. The energy between him and Hemsworth is dynamic, and honestly, it feels like they have more chemistry together than Portman and Hemsworth. Other actors, including Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins, are also top-notch here, and the inclusion of reliable Chris O'Dowd is also welcome. Aside from the acting, we have some pretty entertaining fights bolstered by lavish special effects, the best of which is the admittedly enthralling final brawl in London. What undercuts this, however, is when the film tries to be a low-rent ""Star Wars"" and implement downright stupid aircraft battles in Asgard, complete with faceless warriors carrying lasers, laser-blasting cannons, and laser turrets. Oh, and the main villain can essentially use the Force. I wish I was making this stuff up, but I'm not. It was if the writers didn't know what genre movie was, and artificially tried to appeal to as many demographics as possible.The result of this is a film that falls flat on its face harder than Thor's Mjolnir. Some parts of this movie are genuinely entertaining and fun, but not enough to merit the ticket price, and certainly not enough to merit owning it on home video. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is not an awful movie, but simply a very dull one, one that is nowhere nearly as engaging and fun as its predecessor. With a rushed plot, forced romance, and an ending that feels like a cheap ripoff, there are a lot better things you could spend your money on going to see this month.Overall: C","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IH2S2M6AWPTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUS0U#wasThisHelpful","R3IH2S2M6AWPTM","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Platformers have never quite been the same since the end of the PS2 era. It's a genre that has mainly fallen into the hands of various indie developers, who seem to try and reinvent the wheel several times with each passing year. Sure, we'll get our Marios and Donkey Kongs, but for the most part, platformers have become an increasingly less marketable genre. Heck, even the latest Banjo game had the formerly lovable mascot driving Lego-esque vehicles. As a whole, the market has become incredibly cynical, and not open to games that, well, feel like games, and most of the AAA platformers we do get are stale or outright bad, with the exception of most Nintendo products.Which brings me to Namco, who has had a very similar struggle to reinvent Pac-Man, its flagship character for over 30 years. You name the genre, there's been a game with his bright, rounded face on the cover. Yet, with the exception of a string of great 3D platformers about a decade ago, and some wonderfully trippy Championship Edition entries, the old dog has relied mainly on ports and retreads to survive, while his wife has been a permanent fixture in bowling alleys, laundromats, and bars the world over (along with Galaga, of course.)So it's fitting then, that these two struggles collide headfirst in ""Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures"", an attempt to reboot the character inside of a 3D platformer. The result is a refreshingly uncynical romp that hearkens back to the early 2000's, when a game didn't have to do anything more than be a game. Surprisingly, in today's cutthroat world of people criticizing games for not having enough ""emotion"", this carefree formula delivers in spades.There's not much here in the way of narrative, but for formality's sake, here's the basic set-up. Pac-Man is a student in a futuristic city, which is suddenly set upon by ghosts led by the evil Betrayus. After surviving the initial onslaught of them, however, he discovers that his two best friends have been kidnapped, and that the villain has also taken a volatile device known as the Fridgidigitator. That's pretty much it, but honestly, you're not left wanting for much more than that. The dialogue is cute and even charmingly clever at times, like some of the better Saturday morning cartoons out there. But then again, nobody's necessarily playing a Pac-Man game for the plot.So that leaves us with what really drives a game in this series, and that is the gameplay itself. And even though I can't believe the words being typed right now, it must be stated that this game is absolutely wonderful on that front. This is one of the rare modern, 3D platformers that succeeds on almost every conceivable level at being a fun, engaging, and progressively challenging little adventure. The controls are smooth throughout, ensuring that every life lost feels like the fault of the player, and not of faulty development. Movement is incredibly fluid, with Pac-Man himself having jumps that have a satisfying weight yet forgiving float to them, and a brisk running pace that finds that nice balance between a sprint and a jog. Whether they're outrunning a dragon's deadly fire blasts in a cavern, or jumping between disappearing platforms above a city, players can count on the tight controls to carry them through their adventures. Impressively, that carries over to the combat, which can be a messy affair in most platformers. Here, though, it's kept pretty simple, and plays out like a pared-down version of the ""Batman"" Arkham series' system of melee combat; Pac-Man's basic attack is a chomp, which can be chained between each enemy and lead to combos that allow him to activate a special ""scare"" move. Everything here is simple, but it works exactly how it should, which is more than can be said for a lot of games these days, regardless of the genre.Namco-Bandai went the extra mile, though, and added in an element that could have either made the game or broken it, and it's pleasing to say that the former occurred. The power-ups in ""Ghostly Adventures"" are a sheer delight, and elevate the game to a level that's head and shoulders above the competition. None of them feel gimmicky or tacky in the slightest, each of them contributing something to the wide variety of worlds. Obstructed by a lava geyser? Freeze it as Ice-Pac, then use it to hop to the next area. Want to bounce between a maze of vertical walls? Turn into Rubber-Pac and bounce away. The other power-ups are just as fun, and allow to do everything from shoot elemental blasts, magnetize yourself to metal surfaces, or turn into the Pac-Man equivalent of a Katamari ball, except with more destruction and less collecting stuff. These are all very charming little abilities, and add an extra layer of depth to the game overall, making it one with more variety than others out there.Altogether, the game really plays like a dream. Levels are not too long or too short, for the most part, and considering you'll occasionally need to replay one or two to progress, which is one of my only gripes, that's a godsend. The boss fights are all very creative and fun to battle, and never feel like something to dread. And to top it all off, there are things to break up the platforming, like lava-surfing and sliding down icy passages. To be quite honest, this game comes at a funny time, because almost every single complaint I had about the recent ""Sonic Lost World"" is completely inverted in ""Ghostly Adventures."" Things I hated in that game are things I love about this one, due to the fact that they are done right here, and it never feels like the game is trying to be something it's not, which is an unlikely occurrence into today's marketplace.Now, it seems that the developer did not necessarily have a huge vote of confidence in this game, which is probably why the graphics are a bit on the lower budgeted side. It's certainly not an ugly game, but some textures are kind of jagged and flat, and don't really pop out like other games today. Some levels certainly look better than others, though, and so it's kind of a mixed bag in the end. What's not mixed, though, is the creativity present in each level, which makes up for the lack of graphical prowess. Environments are widely varied, even within worlds that have specific designations like fire or ice. Even the more dark, murky levels are alive with colors and clever visuals which lend a fun, snappy vibe to the entire experience. So while these are certainly not the best graphics you're going to see in a game this year, they may very well be some of the more colorful, which definitely works for what kind of the developers were trying to make.The music and voice acting in this game might be pretty divisive for some. True, the tracks are somewhat endearing, and certainly fit the mood of each level. However, they're not necessarily the most memorable pieces, and it's a real pity that most of the incredibly fun boss and mini-boss encounters don't have tracks of their own. As far as the voice acting goes, I personally find it to be rather adorable and endearing, with each character having a defined attitude and snap. Pac-Man himself is a fun little guy, constantly making puns which are so terrible that you may wince, but are ultimately going to make you laugh out loud. Some may be put off by it sounding exactly like a kids' cartoon, right down to how simplistic the story-telling and cutscenes are, but it didn't damage my experience at all. In fact, it lent a little something to the overall tone that struck a chord.That tone is one found in many platformers of yesteryear, from ""Crash Bandicoot"" to ""Tak and the Power of Juju"" to, more obviously, ""Pac-Man World 2."" This game shows a remarkable amount of restraint, like those games, and never tries to be something it's not. There are no gimmicks or marketing ploys here, only gameplay and funny, pithy little story that simply serves the purpose of pulling you from one level to the next. Furthermore, there are no attempts here to reinvent platformers, or some pretentious drivel like that. Instead of buying a new car, Namco-Bandai refurbished the parts and gave it a new paint job. That is to say, they took an established, classic formula, and managed to do in a way that feels truly sincere.Sure, there are some trivial little bits, like arcade games in which Pac-Man pilots little vehicles, or a miniscule hub world that allows players to interact with the denizens of the game. Putting those insignificant things aside, however, players are given a solid core game that is fun and fresh enough to stand on its own, to the point where I found myself playing bonus levels simply for the sake of experiencing more of what it had to offer.""Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures"" is precisely what the doctor ordered for the troubled 3D platformer genre, having solid gameplay enhanced by fun power-ups, varied levels, and an environment of innocent fun that feels alien in today's cutthroat world of competing military shooters, sandbox games and the like. Sometimes, it doesn't hurt for a game to try nothing more than being a game, and that is precisely what Namco Bandai has done here.Grade: 7.75","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JUF981S7MULV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSLIYXY#wasThisHelpful","R3JUF981S7MULV","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some anime defies classification. How could you possibly begin to describe something that subverts genres and tropes such as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", or to put together the pieces of the puzzle formed by ""Serial Experiments Lain""'s often outlandish narrative? Yet, as a critic, it's a fun challenge to put together insight and opinion in such a way that accurately describes a work, while simultaneously offering criticisms and compliments of it. However, ""Harmageddon"" is undoubtedly one of the biggest reviewing challenges of my entire career. Not because it is particularly profound or thought-provoking, though. This early 80's film may, in fact, be the single worst piece of animation vomited up by the anime industry, and one struggles to find anything good to say about it.Whatever plot is here revolves around a psychic girl who meets a boy, and begins to relay to him a threat that may very well destroy the world. In order to stop it, they must work together and team up with a group of psychic children in hopes of defeating this menacing evil. If you're looking for more, well, you're out of luck. This threadbare and trite pith is about all you're going to get from this movie, which is sad, considering that it's adapted from one of the most profound works of Japanese science fiction. You wouldn't be able to tell that, though, with how little is going on, and how much it's padded out with long expanses of horrendous dialogue and pointless action.Everything here is truly abhorrent, an abomination to every type of genre it tries on. Awkward attempts at humor, forced romance, treacly environmental messages, absurd supernatural elements... truly, the writer has defecated on every single they tried to make work. Emphasis on ""tried."" Put all this together in a nearly three hourThe faults don't stop here, though. Oh, no. Madhouse, one of the most wonderful studios in Japan, must have made this with the smaller remaining budget of another, larger project back in the day, because everything here is positively terrible to look at. Stilted movement in the action sequences ends up making the original ""Speed Racer"" seem like a high-octane thrill ride by comparison, and character designs are so dated that I almost expect somebody to say ""tubular."" That's not even touching on the fact that, for the most part, characters don't even move their lips when speaking. Supposedly, this is because they're telepathic, but let's be honest here and just say that it's one of the stupidest excuses for not wanting to animate lip flaps ever put into ""animation."" If you could call it that.If you were hoping for a nice, cheesy soundtrack that you could at least laugh at, then you're out of luck as well. There is no safe haven from the sheer, awe-inducing badness of this shlock. Most of the score comes from famed British musician, Keith Emerson, who according to the director (in the commentary) was either drunk or high while recording pretty much all of the music. It shows, to put it bluntly. Horribly implemented synthesizers drive some of the most dated music this side of an 80's cop show, except ten times as incoherent and messy. The voice acting is also total garbage, barely matching up with whatever lip flaps there are. And just when you think it can't get any worse, the English dub comes out of left field and sucker-punches you in the gut.I wish this film were some of parody, some ironically awful stroke of brilliance. Alas, it is not. Nothing about this film is enjoyable. Whatever mocking laughs can be derived are worth sifting through over two hours of this cinematic garbage. It never crosses the boundary of ""so bad it's good."" No, this movie is not that lucky. Instead, it transcends ""bad"" into a sort of awfulness that cannot be defined. It's trashy, poorly plotted, somewhat racist, cheesy, trite, and about two dozen other degrading pejoratives that I simply don't have the space for.The fact of the matter is, though, that ""Harmageddon"" is an awful, steaming pile of a film, and is not worth paying any amount for. In fact, it's not even worth watching for free. In fact, it's not even worthy of its very existence. Many Central Park Media titles have gone up in price after the bankruptcy of the revered 90's establishment. This is not one of them, and that fact alone sums up how enthused people really were about a ""20th Anniversary Edition"" of this film.Plot: FAnimation: F-Sound: D-Voice Acting (EN): F-Voice Acting (JP): F+Overall: F","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXRP19GI781J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006HAYF#wasThisHelpful","R3JXRP19GI781J","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most anime series these days have nothing on the amount of controversy raised by 2011's ""Blood-C."" Some have decried as a horrendously boring show with an ending that comes out of nowhere, while others have lauded its bold attempts to subvert expected norms in a modern anime series. Opinions are generally split straight down the middle, but where nobody disagrees is that the main program ends on a rather unsavory note, and an even more unsavory cliffhanger. That cliffhanger is resolved in ""Blood-C: Last Dark"", and while not every loose end is ultimately wrapped up, fans of the first part of this divisive saga will go home happy. Mostly.Without getting into too much spoiler territory, Saya is on a quest for revenge after the surprisingly brutal events that took place during the climax of the series' final arc. Left for dead and out for blood, her travels take her to Tokyo in an attempt to take down the corporation behind the tragedy that turned her life upside-down. What she finds there is a city under an oppressive regime, with heavy restrictions based on what can be posted online, when people of a certain age can go out at night, and other punishing restrictions. This time, she is not alone in her battles, however, as she meets an underground ground of hackers and activists who plan on taking back the city. As it just so happens, their agenda lines up perfectly with her own, and together they begin to go up against an enemy who is better equipped, better funded, and all around stronger than they are.Overall, the story is one that is infinitely more accessible than what we found in the initial series. We have a cast of characters that, while underdeveloped, are nevertheless relatable and spunky. There's a coherent narrative which is full of twists and turns, and avoids the stretches of tedium of its predecessor, which is partially due to the medium through which this story is delivered. And last, but certainly not least, we have an interesting and unconventional love story going on amidst all of this, one that acts as yet another subversion of expected norms for this type of series. Without giving too much away, the relationship that slowly blossoms between Saya and the other party is incredibly bittersweet, and although you can't help but shake the feeling that their affection for each other is doomed, the movie keeps you rooting for them until the very end.Animation-wise, it was perhaps for the better than Production IG cut short the series and made a theatrical movie, because what's on display here is nothing short of incredible. Even by the studio's own standards, the visuals are some of the best in Japanese animation history, completely fluid and gorgeous in high-definition. The fight sequences are, of course, the real showstopper here, visceral and gory to some extreme degrees, and rendered in beautiful, precise detail. Even the CG, which is a hit-or-miss aspect of many anime productions, is incredible here, especially during the final battle, which is one of my personal favorite climaxes to any film in years. Everything here looks great, and it's definitely worth shelling out money for the Blu-Ray.The score is also fantastic, brought to you by series composer Naoki Sato. Dramatic and sweeping, the music keeps you engaged throughout the entire picture, blending naturally into each scene. Nana Mizuki's ending song, ""Metro Baroque"", is also great, and is among one of her best singles. Speaking of Mizuki, her turn as Saya in ""Last Dark"" is truly something breathtaking, as she no longer reverts to the ""cutesy"" Saya. This allows her to bring out deeper pathos and tragedy in the character, fleshing her out into a tortured but determined heroine who will stop at nothing to get answers for why she was brutally wronged. Of course, this actress is no stranger to larger roles, but this is one of her best simply because it's unlike anything she's done before, and breaks out of her usual character types dramatically. Other cast members in the film are great, definitely, but none excel quite as much as her.Now, despite some of these glowing praises, ""Last Dark"" is not necessarily a perfect film. While most of the loose ends of the series' narrative are tied up, there are still some lingering questions at the end of the experience, a few actually brought about the film itself. The somewhat taunting conclusion hints at a sequel that we will most likely never receive, which is honestly a bad note to wrap things up on. Another major complaint would be the bloated nature of the whole experience, which is partially due to the longer-than-most running time of 150 minutes. Some scenes feel extraneous, such as a bathhouse sequence which seems to serve no purpose other than to show some of the female characters' breasts and butts, and the movie could have benefited without them. While the running time does a bit to make the whole experience seem a bit more ""epic"", so to speak, I can't help but feel that it could benefited from some careful cutting.""Blood-C: Last Dark"" is a bit like the series itself. It's imperfect, but ultimately, Production IG makes an admirable attempt to do something new in the increasingly stagnant anime marketplace. While there are definitely more narrative flaws and pacing issues present in the film than in the initial 12 episodes, and a cruel tease of an ending, this is definitely something that will keep fans happy, while at the same time standing on its own as a fine piece of entertainment.Plot: BAnimation: AVoice Acting: B+Music: B+Overall: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZQ3417B3QF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E00G9AQ#wasThisHelpful","R32ZQ3417B3QF5","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was last year when I went with my family to go see the reboot of ""The Three Stooges."" For the entire 5-10 minute car trip home, I could not stop laughing, to the point where I had to make myself focus on my breathing so I wouldn't choke. The point being, that was the last time I remember a movie making me laugh so riotously, and I thought it would take years for me to find another. Low and behold, Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the ""Jackass"" crew nearly made me pass out from laughter with their latest masterpiece of raunch.""Bad Grandpa"" follows Irving, a crotchety old man who has recently been widowed, much to his delight. His aspirations of sleeping with everything living, breathing and female are cut short, however, by his daughter being sent to prison (again.) This wouldn't be a problem if she didn't have a son whose deadbeat father was across the country, but much to the grandfather's chagrin, that's precisely the case. And so begins a cross-country journey with Irving and eight year-old Billy, who can never quite seem to go anywhere without getting in some sort ridiculous antics. Whether it being trying to move Irving's dead wife from his trunk to a hotel room, or putting Billy in drag to win money in a child beauty pageant, the hijinks in this movie are among the best in a modern comedy.What makes these moments even more special is that, for the most part, Knoxville and company made the very wise decision to stage this in a ""Borat""-like fashion. This means that all of the shocked, bewildered, and offended reactions you see on camera were not staged, which is surprising when taking into consideration some of the things that they get away with here. A funeral is crashed in the most heinously inappropriate way possible, a kiddie ride goes haywire and crashes through a store window, and a farting competition in a restaurant results in explosive wall defecation. Just when you think this movie can't get any more over the top, it winks at you and laughs, then does something completely unexpected and out of the blue. It keeps upping its own ante, which is exactly what makes these kinds of flicks work.Even more of a delight is the fact that there is, believe it or not, a soul to this movie. The cross-country road trip with Irving and Billy is refreshingly touching at times, showing some of the signature heart that Knoxville typically displays in his non-""Jackass"" outings. The writers wisely stayed away from making fun of the mother and father's situation too much, probably realizing that this is a very real reality for many children. Instead, we get to see an old geezer and a reckless little boy duke it out, then realize over time that they actually are very fond of each other. It's pretty touching at times, and while it certainly isn't anything groundbreaking, it's still a sort of feel-good movie.That isn't to say everything here is great. Some gags get overused a bit too much, such as Billy trying to pick up women for his grandfather, and the continuous usage of the dead grandmother prop. There are also occasionally jokes that just don't work that well, like Knoxville wrangling a fish that has a massive human penis. Also, it feels like the movie could have perhaps benefited from a slightly shorter running time, by about 10 minutes or so. Still, these are very minor complaints for a movie that is, by and large, one of the funniest I've seen.When I saw this film, I was laughing harder than anybody in the entire theater. There were tears streaking down my face during some of the more outrageous gags, and even some of the not-so-funny stuff managed to elicit some strong chuckles. And at the end of the whole experience, right through the hilarious outtakes, none of it really made me feel bad for any of the bystanders involved (you'll get to see why during the credits), and I felt happy at the ultimate outcome for these two likable oafs of characters.""Bad Grandpa"" is not going to win any awards, but it is going to make you bust a gut and care about the characters, which is more than I can say for most comedies these days.Grade: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBX6JYCHNXS1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2PA0ES#wasThisHelpful","RBX6JYCHNXS1E","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By all accounts, I'm what could be considered a ""Sonic fanboy."" Even some of the character's worst outings have managed to keep my interest, and I still faithfully buy the new entries in the venerable series within a week of their launch, if not the very same day. Sure, it's made for some terrible purchases, such as the abysmal ""Secret Rings"", ""The Black Knight"" and (dare I speak its name) ""Shadow The Hedgehog."" But it's also resulted in some of my favorite games of the last few generations, such as ""Colors"", ""Generations"", and ""Adventure"" 1&2, not to mention the plethora of wonderful handheld games. But it often feels that I'm in a minority, given that a lot of mainstream critics constantly ask for Sega to reinvent its mascot, which results each new game attempting some dramatic shift that either works or falls flat.As a result, the Sonic franchise comes across as having a bit of an identity crisis, trying very hard to remain relevant in the ever-shifting landscape of electronic entertainment. And while most games fall on one side of the spectrum or the other, the blue blur's latest escapade lays bare every single problem his series has, while at the same time offering glimpses of a solution that are woefully underutilized. ""Sonic Lost World"" is a game that tries on several pairs of shoes, but only about half of them fit. But when they fit, they do so perfectly.So, in the obligatory narrative, we see Sonic and Tails, along with welcome additions Knuckles and Amy, discovering a lost world consisting of floating landmasses. They're chasing Robotn-... erm, Eggman, as he has once again captured fuzzy little animals and shoved them in capsules. This time, however, the arch-villain has a race of mysterious demons on his side known only as ""The Deadly Six."" And once Sonic eliminates the method he's using to control these enemies, they turn on both of them and attempt to suck the life out of this mysterious world. So, begrudgingly, the two old rivals team up (sort of) and try to stop these menacing foes before everything around them becomes, to quote Amy, ""cold and dead.""Now, the fact that Amy, the cutesy heroine of the series, would use such a phrase in this game should indicate the type of dialogue Sonic Team has opted for this time around. While the story is not particularly complex or nuanced, the character interactions holding it together are truly something special... albeit a bit darker than what we expect from Sega's flagship series. There are sharp, funny exchanges that would not be out of place in a PG-13 movie, delivered by some excellent voice actors that show full commitment to their roles. Extra props should go to the voicework and writing of The Deadly Six, who often deliver very menacing threats. The first enemy you face says such charming things as ""I'll skin you alive"" or ""you're going home in a box"", and while it rarely gets more violent than that, this tone of pure villainy is something new for the franchise, and a welcome change of pace. The story isn't great, but with dialogue this entertaining, one almost doesn't care. Unfortunately, the plot is the least of this game's worries.In Sega's attempts to address every concern ever brought up about the franchise, the gameplay in ""Lost World"" is an often disappointing hodge-podge of different genres. When it works, it does so swimmingly. There are some levels in ""Lost World"" that are truly some of my favorite in the franchise, such as an exhilarating grind-rail roller coaster through a water vortex, a vertical descent through a floating forest and a blistering run through coastal scenery that ends with Sonic bounding from clouds hundreds of feet above ground. However, these stand in stark contrast to levels that are, quite frankly, derivative and unbearable. Guiding giant pieces of fruit into a blender to make surfable juice paths, trudging poorly-designed and out-of-place level themed around candy, and slogging down a tunnel that frustrating has patches of molasses-like goop that you can't speed through or jump over are insufferable experiences that threaten to completely undo whatever fun you might have been having.This inconsistency carries over to the styles of gameplay Sonic team tried to tackle, and more often than not, failed pretty terribly. Aside from the 3D speeding and 2D platforming, you'll be awkward pacing through isometric levels, jumping slowly from floating platform to floating platform, and other things that feel brutally out of place in a Sonic game. What's worse is that these horrible segments are often in the middle of levels that are otherwise great, jerking you out of one gameplay style right into one that is tedious and frustratingly controlled. The final nail in the coffin of these segments is that they unabashedly steal from other, better games, ironically ones that are made by Nintendo. Running on spherical surfaces a la ""Super Mario Galaxy"", dodging mine carts and shooting from hidden barrels like ""Donkey Kong Country"", and other parts are sprinkled liberally into this game. It's disappointing, really, because it feels like Sonic Team didn't have enough confidence in the character to allow him to do his own thing. The end result is a 3D platforming game that feels as if Sonic just happens to be the star, as opposed to being a genuine Sonic experience.The fact that this is the case is especially upsetting considering that Sonic actually controls better than he ever has in 3D. No more floating and no more steering like car; the hedgehog moves with the utmost precision as far as moving the analogue stick goes. However, the same cannot be said for his speed and ""parkour."" Sonic will confusingly slow down and speed up, to the point where it often felt like it was totally out of my control when I was jumping or trying to run through levels. Again, it comes across as the developer taking too much criticism from too many sources into consideration, and meeting in a very uncomfortable middling zone. As much as some levels bring back good memories of the ""Adventure"" franchise, others bring back nightmarish flashbacks to the tawdry ""Labyrinth"" and ""3D Blast"" days, which is some of the worst criticism that could be stooped upon a game. Not only that, but the much-hyped ""parkour"" is nothing special, instead allowing Sonic moves and abilities that should come standard with pretty much every 3D platforming character, albeit a bit sloppier. Sonic Team should not be touting the fact that Sonic controls properly when trying to come up with marketable bullet points, because honestly, when I buy a game, I expect it to control properly.Finally, two parts of the game are some of the worst mechanics in any Sonic game ever created. Firstly, the boss fights are simply terrible. In concept, many of them are very interesting, but they are marred by a slow pace and unclear hit boxes on the enemies. Not only that, but there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to how much damage any given boss can take, and coupled with their sluggish timing, they become thoroughly terrible experiences. Secondly, in a throwback to ""Sonic Unleashed"" that nobody asked for, players are forced to collect a certain amount of trinkets to progress. In this case, they're animals, and you get them by finding capsules, killing enemies, and beating levels. The only problem? Well, the levels that have the most animals in them are usually the least fun to play, and thus, you'll find yourself slogging through bad levels in order to play more of the game. ""Colors"" and ""Generations"" managed to make trinket-collecting more or less optional, and its return here is a complete buzzkill. Also, as an aside, the Wisp powers from ""Colors"" return here, and they feel awkward and out of place as all get-out. Most of them control with the elegance and grace of an ice-skating rhinoceros, and also manage to derail the fun.At least the game looks pretty good. Well,for the most part. Most levels are bright and vibrant, and certainly make the most out of the WiiU's capabilities. Character models are beautiful, as is most of the scenery. That being said, a lot of the darker levels feel dull and uninspired, filled with the grey-and-brown color scheme that haunts far too many modern games. It's even worse when these poorly-designed parts are in the same level that houses some excellent scenery, once again adding to a brutally inconsistent tone to the whole experience. However, it's really not all bad, and mostly, the variety of levels and fluidity of the motion make for a fairly nice-looking package. Also, the pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty fantastic.As usual with the lesser Sonic entries, though, the real star of the show is the exceptional soundtrack. From coastal grooves to fast synths, from sitars to electric guitars, the musical variety here is simply wonderful. Oftentimes, a boring level would lead to me doing poorly because I was paying more attention to the soundtrack than actually playing the game. That being said, many levels suffer from BGM that is unoriginal (desert levels sound like desert levels, etc), which brings it down somewhat. However, the voice work is undoubtedly the best in any Sonic game. Sometimes, interactions between Sonic and his pals can be frustrating and grating on the ears, but here, it's fast, furious and witty. That's partially thanks to the aforementioned writing, but also due to the fantastic cast that's been with us since ""Colors."" If this game were being judged solely on audio merits, it would receive high marks. It's not, of course, but if it was, it would.And maybe that's what Sonic Team was hoping for: that players would focus on the technical prowess on display here, and not the fundamentally broken center at the very core of the game. Unfortunately, I can't be that kind. While some of what's on display here reminds us why we still give these games a chance, a lot of the chaff is absolutely inexcusable. By listening too much to the suggestions of others, the developers have marred what could have been an absolutely superb game. And while it's still worth playing if you want to see some of the best this series can offer, you have to be prepared to work for your fun.""Sonic Lost World"" is an indictment of the franchise as a whole. It's fantastic at points, but ultimately, it has no real idea what it wants to be, which results in a game that is almost as equally frustrating as it is fun. That being said, if you can forgive its flaws (which are many), it can be a truly fun and lovable game that offers some insight into where Sonic Team should go with future entries.Plot: 7Gameplay: 5Graphics: 7Sound: 8Overall:  6UPDATE (11/4/13): After much thought, and much continuing into the game, and reflection, I felt it necessary to drop my score a point. It simply does not get better as it goes on, and becomes a deeply frustrating experience that I cannot, in all fairness, wholeheartedly recommend. More downvotes are inevitable, as people seem to not respect opinions that differ from their own, despite how well-defended they might be. So be it, though. This is not a very good game to me, and that is a stance I will staunchly defend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16T12D44ZZFO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D41GCVS#wasThisHelpful","R16T12D44ZZFO2","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christopher Nolan left an undeniable impact on the Batman brand. More often than not, it's common to hear people sing the praises of the caped crusader based solely on The Dark Knight Trilogy and the events within it. But when you take a look back at the character's history, Gotham's stoic protector is not a superhero with consistently high-octane events occurring all around him. Instead, he is a detective with an arsenal of fanciful gadgets, who pushes himself physically and mentally to solve crimes and clean the streets. He is more ""Man"" than ""Bat"", really, and people often seem to forget that.Luckily, Warner Brothers Games Montreal have not, and despite their questionable handling of the gameplay at times, they have managed to craft a truly engaging experience that manages to delve deeper into the tortured protagonist in the mixed, but ultimately recommended ""Batman: Arkham Origins.""We're spared the origin story we've been told umpteen times by now (little rich boy sees parents get killed, stumbles upon cave, grows up, trains, fights criminals), and instead, ""Origins"" delves into the beginnings of Batman's early crime-fighting escapades. Only, not all of Gotham sees him as a hero, as the police doggedly pursue him, and people he protects from thugs cower in fear at his very presence. Even Gordon (pre-Commissioner days) doesn't like the guy. That doesn't make it any easier for our lovable anti-hero when he already has a city full of assassins sent to kill him for a ridiculously high bounty. But all is not as it seems, and as the plot thickens, we see power dynamics among villains shift, we see the corruption tearing apart Gotham's police department, and we see the introduction of an infamous foe who decidedly shakes up the course of the narrative.The narrative here is, in a word, shocking. This take on Batman is shockingly dark, much more in line with the Frank Miller and Alan Moore styles of storytelling than, say, the Paul Dini method. Some of the content in this game quite frankly pushes the envelopes of what can be done in a T rating, delving into some deeply disturbing content both graphically and tonally. Not that this is a bad thing, of course, because it all blends up into a delicious stew of gritty, compelling goodness, and ends up becoming my favorite plot in the entire Arkham series of games. We get to know Batman as a character more deeply, smaller villains are given their time to shine, and the seedier days of Gotham City are fully explored to a very effective extent. Not only that, but the titular character is much less focused on heroics, and more interested in sneaking through vents, investigating crime scenes, and taking down in goons in a quick, brutal fashion. This is an origin story worth telling, and one that will stick with me.But there is a huge caviat here, and one that I feel I should fairly warn people about. The gameplay is... well, to put it simply, it's pretty unremarkable for a good portion of the game. While the combat of the series is unchanged, and is still very satisfying, it's gotten to a point where I feel some variety might need to be in order. Yes, they do introduce new enemy types, and yes, the new gadgets are very cool (more on those in a second), but the combat and exploration themselves need a major overhaul in the next entry, and WB's refusal to address that concern might lead to a seriously awful game. Slogging through waves of enemies gets to be a bit of a chore, and getting lost due to lack of a good navigation system threatens to undermine my enjoyment of the game.Luckily, however, those concerns are offset by some pleasant surprises that keep me coming back for more. First and foremost, the stealth segments of ""Origins"" are undoubtedly the best in the series, giving players a wider variety of ways to take down enemies. The head-on approach works fine, but so do stalking and incapacitating, using gadgets to stun and dispatch foes, or simply finding ways to sneak past a majority of the enemies without any major conflict. New gadgets aid this variety. My personal favorite is the Remote Wire, which can act as a tightrope to sneak above enemies, a zipline to kick people in the face, or a wire to fling objects into people, or to fling people off of ledges. Yes, it's a little reminiscent of ""Just Cause 2""'s grappling hook, but it's still a fun little tool, and just one of the many gadgets that do a good job of allowing players to play how they want to.Another nice addition are the expanded crime scenes, which Batman now uses more high-tech gadgetry to recreate. He can fast-forward and rewind time to look for more details and inconsistencies, which all eventually adds up to a really cool cutscene that shows players blow-by-blow what happened. Personally, I really like this mechanic, but there are some issues. First off, it kind of feels like it handholds players through these segments, taking away a real sense of discovery. Sure, we eventually get a really cool explanation of everything that's transpired, but it feels kind of linear. But my second concern is a bit more major, which is that this was a crucial gameplay mechanic in this year's fantastic ""Remember Me"", and for this game to ape it and not expand upon feels kind of cheap. Other than those two issues, however, it's nice to see Batman going back to his ""Detective Comics"" days.So, when it all adds together, the gameplay is serviceable. Combat is great but overused, exploration is fun but poorly guided; however, the stealth and detective work aspects bring it up to something that I would recommend to a good portion of people. Couple that with side missions that I feel genuinely add to the world and the overarching narrative, and you've got a pretty solid package. But there's one thing that almost ruins the entire experience altogether, and that's the shocking amount of bugs. Bosses automatically die, Batman clips into areas before he's supposed to there, enemy models get stuck in walls (or go through them), and waypoints simply don't appear. It's upsetting that WB saw this fit to release in this state, and while it is still a fun game that is worth playing, it's pretty freaking rough for a ""AAA"" title.And seeing that this a ""AAA"" title, it stands to reason that the game would have good visuals, and indeed, it's a fairly nice-looking game. Enemy designs are fairly varied, and the rogue's gallery of villains on display offers a nice range of psychotic baddies. Batman's character model itself is also something impressive, and it actually has more detail than we've historically seen on him in games, from scrapes on his armor to a defined beard. The locales fair a little worse, though. While Gotham is a fun city to explore, the visuals used to render it are often ugly, and more often than not, you're going to experience some pop-ins and graphical glitches. That being said, building interiors are intricately designed, brimming with things to do and ways to approach different missions. So while the graphics are fairly decent, the design underneath them fairs a bit better.Unquestionably to me, though, the best part of this game next to the compelling narrative is fantastic audio work that went into it. The soundtrack bleeds atmosphere, and hits all of the high notes one expects from a Batman experience, along with complementing each narrative twist along the way. Even the music for side missions (such as a drug-induced trip into Wonderland courtesy of The Mad Hatter) is great. Same goes for the vocal cast, with new V.A.s taking over the iconic roles of Batman and Joker, and completely nailing it. Even the smaller bits of dialogue, such as banter between dim-witted thugs, is well-written and performed with a screwball, comic book-y tone that gives some extra humor to offset the grim nature of the game.This game is not perfect, and in fact, many parts of are woefully unpolished. However, that does not make it a bad game in my mind. It is clear that plenty of effort went into making the story and gameplay come together, as well as into the fantastic voice acting and scoring. While some critics see ""Origins"" as a cash-grab and a rush job, I'm liable to disagree. It is a fun, if flawed, journey, and while it certainly won't be one of the best games of 2013, it is one that I would encourage people to try, especially if they want to see Batman done in a suitably gritty and dark fashion.""Batman: Arkham Origins"" is a smaller, more focused game that its predecessors, and while it suffers due to some unfortunate design choices and poor bug testing, it is still very much worth playing just to feel the gratification of getting under the hood once again.Plot: 9.5Gameplay: 7Graphics: 7Sound: 9Overall: 8","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YW5XVYSHTXKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7103DO#wasThisHelpful","R1YW5XVYSHTXKX","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a full confession to make about this show. When it was first airing, my first viewing of the series was stalled significantly due to the fact that it seemed trite, boring, and repetitive. Throughout most of my time with the series, I found the characters to be deeply cliche, the narrative to be predictable, the suspense to be canned. So, after it had finished airing, I decided to marathon the rest on a whim due to lack of shows at the time. And I'm glad I did, because all of my complaints became defenses. Every single thing you hate about ﻿﻿Blood-C ﻿is put there intentionally to through you off of what is one of the most self-aware send-ups of the anime industry I've ever seen.On a very surface level, the plot follows Saya, a ditzy schoolgirl who happens to live at and train in a shrine on a secluded island. She eats sweets, pets stray animals, and acts like an all-around klutz. Her friends are pink-haired, silly twins, and her love interest is a stoic, yet bashful boy. But by night, she becomes a deadly swordswoman, murdering brutal creatures called Chiropterans in a horribly bloody fashion. So, to recap, a cutesy nerd turns into a badass by night and protects her town in secret. Yep, this sounds like a remarkably worn premise, no?Unfortunately, I cannot reveal the mind-boggling twist that occurs to you at the end of the series. It would ruin the effect of the show, which is to beat you into submission by using every single contemporary anime cliche imaginable. Terrible slice-of-life shows, dull grimdark action series, and other popular genres are merged together into a homoculus of stereotypes, making for an experience that is thoroughly and utterly predictable. Until, all of a sudden, it isn't. In the last 2-3 episodes, everything you thought up until that point is brutally subverted. Everything wrong with the modern anime industry is laid bare, put up on the chopping block, then (literally and metaphorically) butchered. In the end, we get one of the most beautifully meta-analytic works to come out of the anime industry since ﻿Neon Genesis Evangelion﻿.The show is certainly beautiful to look at as well. Character designs by Clamp are brought to vivid life thanks to the vibrant animation by Production IG. Backgrounds are simply gorgeous to look at, despite their usage during some of the shows more intentionally dull parts. Fight sequences are tight and move along at a nice, brisk pace, and result in buckets of satisfying gore. Most impressive to me, though, are the freakish monsters. Almost every single one of them is the stuff nightmares are made of, and I often questioned how in the heck they were conceived. Raw imagination oozes from the aesthetics of the show, in more ways than one.Background music is very solid. Definitely nothing that's wholly special, but it gets the job done depending on the scene, and for a show that is trying on a lot of different styles at once, that's definitely an admirable job. The opening and ending clips, however, are definitely exceptional, and are in fact some of the best in recent years. Most impressive to me is the opening, which combines Japanese, English and French to an awesome, thrashing J-Rock song, and tops it off with some excellent animation.Blood-C ﻿is supposed to infuriate you, and supposed to bore you at times, and supposed to make you roll your eyes. It does this with the express purpose of making you realize most of the problems with the anime we watch today, and to anger you as everything you took for granted is coldly snatched away at the last second. This show is a coldhearted smack in the face to works by studios like Kyoto Animation, and a sneering jab at otaku who keep throwing money at slice-of-life and moe series. While some of the execution is a bit sloppy, its intentions are in the right place.Some people call the writers of this series ""trolls"" for how they wrapped up. Me? I call them brilliant for having the guts to pull a fantastically cruel practical joke on everybody, including myself.Plot: A-Animation: AMusic: BOverall: A-","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K0DM41OGEAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T3ADGA#wasThisHelpful","R39K0DM41OGEAZ","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's honestly no point in giving a huge introduction to this franchise. Divisive and controversial, yet deeply important and innovative to the video game industry, Rockstar's ""Grand Theft Auto"" series has been riveting gamers and pushing boundaries since 2001's ""Grand Theft Auto III"", and hasn't let up its hold on the industry yet. But to me, this franchise has always had a tad bit of immaturity in its veins, even with the sobering ballad of Niko Bellic in IV. So, to my surprise, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" represents a new direction for the series, mature in every sense of the word, its humor deeply biting at pop culture, society at large, and even the series itself. Oh, yeah, it's also incredibly fun.Our ""heroes"" this time around are three incredibly different and eclectic characters, with years of trouble and experience written on their faces. There's Michael, a former thief who's been relocated via witness protection and has fallen into a retirement with a family that he now hates. Michael, through a series of circumstances involving a crash through a storefront, meets Franklin, who is a young street hustler that begins to learn tricks of the trade from his new acquaintance. And then there's Trevor, a former acquaintance of Michael, who is completely unhinged and running a meth enterprise out in the middle of the desert. They come together, somewhat reluctantly, to pull off a series of increasingly ridiculous heists, along with dealing with their own personal motivations and past demons.As you probably know by now, you control all three characters, which is an ingenious little system at first. After a few hours of gameplay, you can start cutting between characters at any time you want to for the most part, which can lead to some hilarious results. Cutting to Trevor may find him waking up on a bridge in his underwear nursing a hangover, or Franklin might be admiring the intricacies of a new house he's been given. Not only that, but there are certain missions and side-missions exclusive to each character, and certain strengths and weaknesses attributed to each character, along with unique special skills. That all being said, the gimmick wears off after a while, and it gets to the point where switching characters is only fun in missions, while the game begins to limit what you can do based on arbitrary reasons. It's a cool system, and it's definitely solid on a conceptual level, but it often feels like Rockstar didn't know what to do with this new mechanic.However, the elements at play in the narrative are incredible in every sense of the word. Part black comedy, part introspective drama, and part bitter commentary on the state of American society, everything about the overarching story is impeccably written. Dialogue is terse, and the situations grow increasingly unpredictable and shocking. This is definitely Rockstar's writing team at their best, yet even then, remnants of their past games remain. Women are still relegated to fairly unimportant roles, and the portrayals of racial minorities are still pretty cliche. Now, this isn't a dealbreaker, and I'm not personally offended by any of it, but it's definitely something that should be addressed and considered. Personally, I wonder whether or not Rockstar is making a commentary on how the industry portrays those demographics, or if they simply struggle to make compelling characters in that range. Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide that.No questions should be cast on the gameplay, though. Every major complaint received on the past entry (and there were plenty) seems to have been addressed. The gunplay is tight and flawless, taking cues from their work on ""Max Payne 3."" Driving feels fluid, every car driving in a completely different fashion, but all of them bound by racing game-like tightness and control. Not only that, but they are much lighter and more pliable for doing insane stunts that are much more in line with ""San Andreas"", which has been my golden standard for this series. Flying helicopters is much less cumbersome, as well, and the planes handle like a dream. Even walking, running, and climbing has a fun, parkour-like feeling to it. Playing the game is a total joy, without a doubt.Missions are a vast improvement over IV, presenting a massive amount of variety and challenge. Sometimes, you'll be stalking a target and killing them, a la every sandbox crime game ever. But mostly, you'll be chasing down a plane that your partner has shot down via motorbike, jumping frantically over trains and narrowly missing being smashed by a passing bus, or smashing into an armored van while wearing wrestler's masks, then proceeding to mow down 50+ cops with multiple weapons. The game is immediately fast and furious, throwing the shoehorned realism IV attempted to maintain by dripfeeding players missions that were only marginally better than the typical ""drive and shoot"" ones.A great addition to the series are the Heist missions, which are set up by a series of side-missions (gathering a submarine, buying boiler suits, etc.). After that, the player selects their approach (stealthy or violent), picks their cohorts (who will have their own cuts, and bring their own liabilities), and sets up other miscellaneous elements, like vehicles and weapons. Then, after pulling off these missions, which contain death-defying stunts and high-adrenaline chases, among other things, players get their cut based on how much loot they stole during the whole process. Everything about these missions is left up to the player, which is a fantastic element that adds an entirely new level of depth to the overall experience.That same depth applies to most of the missions, though. This is not a game that holds your hand and tells you how to do certain missions. Do you want to storm into a meth den and run over the rednecks who run it, then proceed to use explosives on the rest of the inhabitants? Or do you want to stealthily dispatch each guard, and instill a sense of unease in them as you gradually proceed? If you're hijacking a submarine, do you snipe it down from the ropes, or do you shoot up the entire ship? Kill or spare? Sneak or destroy? Everything is entirely up to you, and the game unravels entirely based on your choices, including your characters stats in various fields, another element that returns from ""San Andreas.""All of this, and the game is just a joy to look at. Los Santos and all of its locales and inhabitants is an entrancing, beautiful map that is immensely expansive and fun to explore. The textures are clean and colorful, with the dull, grey tones of IV long gone. Character animations are astounding in their dynamism, with even things like hijacking cars possessing a unique set of involved and nuanced animations. Even the cars get realistic damage and scrapes based upon where they get hit. It is beautiful to look at the entire time, and you will become immersed in the world the more you play. Don't be surprised if you even start dreaming about the place. I know I did.Unsurprisingly, Rockstar wins once again in the audio department. The voice acting, always a series strength, is excellent here once again, with the characters of Trevor and Michael being the indisputable highlights of the cast. Also nice is the amount of effort put into the NPC dialogue, with every pedestrian seemingly able to engage in pretty involved conversations with you (or about you), depending on which character you're playing as. And to tie it all together, the soundtrack is certainly the best in the series, with a disgustingly copious amount of radio stations containing around 240 licensed tracks, with well-known artists like Rihanna, Queen, and The Game, and a cornucopia of indie outfits with a massive amount of variety in terms of the genres at play.So, Rockstar's latest opus is certainly a great game. In fact, it's easily one of the best of this generation, and one which redefines sandbox games. However, my primary issue with it, and the reason I hesitate to call it ""perfect"" is that... well, nothing is tonally new about it. Sure, the gameplay has been refined. Sure, the narrative is more mature and biting than past entries. Sure, it may be one of the best games I've ever played, and it may be the culmination of everything this console generation has been working towards. But things that I've always complained about this franchise are still here, and the fact remains that every narrative device at play here has been done before in other media, and done just as competently, if not better.Yes, this is a very good game. In fact, it's a great one. Almost everything about it is fun, outside of some mission repetition as the experience wears on. However, despite how good the characters are, and how lovably biting the satire is, the narrative itself is still pretty trite, and explores themes and elements that have already been done several times over. Which puts this whole game in an awkward position. This is a fun and fast game, and everything it does, it does right. But outside of a lot of great missions and dynamic set pieces, and an ungodly amount of polish, there's a certain ""been there, done that"" feeling about the whole thing.""Grand Theft Auto V"" is, without a doubt, one of the best entries in the GTA franchise. Maybe even the best. But it's not the best I've played this year, and certainly not the most innovative. It's worth every cent, due to the fact that you will have fun with every hour you spend in it, but if you want narrative innovation and unique gameplay, it's not the best place to find that. However, if you pass up such a well-made genre piece because you solely seek innovation, you'll be missing out on a fun, snide, and vitriolic takedown of everything America holds sacred.Overall: 9","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQM848SUV2ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SXKU4#wasThisHelpful","R3SQM848SUV2ZN","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the course of the past week, I've done several things that I have never even thought possible in video games. Piloting a spaceship and shooting down enemies as Haddaway's ""What Is Love"" blasts into my ears. Running up the side of a building to face down enemies while wielding elemental superpowers and a laser sword that disintegrates all that it touches. And, oh yes, using a gun powered by dubstep to blow apart the inside of a 1950's sitcom. So many new experiences, but not from several games. Because these past few weeks, I've only been playing ""Saints Row IV"", and it's already one of my favorite games of this generation.After the events of the fiercely entertaining but ultimately flawed ""Saints Row The Third"", the player-created leader of the Saints (known only as The Boss) has somehow found his or her self in the position of POTUS. But players don't have much time to bask in presidential glory, because within the first 20 minutes, Earth is invaded by aliens, the White House is blown up, and you're slapped in a computer simulation of a 1950's sitcom. Once you break up, you find Earth has been blown up, and the only way to get even with the alien menace is to get inside a simulation of Steelport, Stilwater, and other locations. Oh, yeah, you also have superpowers this time around. As in, almost every conceivable type of power you can think of.If this story sounds a bit silly, please let me dispel that thought. The writers have crafted something that is not only a bit silly, but instead is downright stupid, immature, and borderline nonsensical. However, it is because of this that it is an unparalleled success in the industry. Most games that attempt comedy do it in the entirely wrong ways. ""Portal 2"" is the most recent success, and even that was only marginally amusing to me. SRIV takes the gonzo approach of sending up anything and everything, including itself. The most ludicrous movies, pop culture from multiple decades, and especially video games are sent up in the most loving method imaginable.Not only that, but the story itself isn't half-bad. Aping elements from ""Mass Effect"", ""The Matrix"", and ""They Live"", the narrative is equally as compelling as it is ridiculous. Not only that, but it's filled with some of the most likable characters in video game history. Most major characters from every SR game are here, including Johnny Gat, Kinzie Kensington, Shaundi (both SR2 and SR3 versions of her), Ben King... and many, many more. Not only that, but the narrative directly recalls events, locales, and even minor in-game brands from all games. In terms of a great narrative, excellent characters, and ingenious fan service, SRIV is an unparalleled success.Same goes for the gameplay. When players aren't walking around the hub world of the ship, or immersed in a side simulation, they're running free in the relatively large virtual Steelport. And I do mean ""free."" This time around, with the superpowers thrown into the mix, the open world feels as if it's positively brimming with possibilities. Do you fly a jet to bomb a swarm of enemies, or freeze them with your powers from hundreds of feet in the air? Do you plow through cars in a take or sports car, or use your super speed to plow through them? Shotguns or telekinesis? Grenades or a tank? If you like variety, then you're in luck, because there's virtually no wrong way to go about playing this game. It takes the best elements from every open-world game this generation and mixes it into the brimming pot, resulting in a zesty blend of varied action.That's not the only good news, however. With THQ's somewhat oppressive grip on the franchise loosed, Volition no longer has to slice off content and sell it off as DLC. Instead, this game offers a daunting amount of things to do and to unlock in any given playthrough. Your minimap will be absolutely flooded with side-quests, side-missions, activities, and little trinkets to pick up. As a longtime gamer, I was floored by the amount of variety and depth the game offered, with far more content than ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" and ""Far Cry 3"", and seemingly as much as any given Bethesda game. For a game that many people dismiss as ""too silly"", that's a pretty big accomplishment.All this, and the game sounds great too. The voice actors are all over-the-top and ridiculous, especially Daniel Dae Kim as Johnny Gat, Natalie Lander as Kinzie, and JB Blanc as the delightfully villainous Zinyak. On top of that, Keith David plays himself in one of the best self-lampooning performances I've ever heard, and Roddy Piper shows up as himself during a mission that is based, verbatim, off of the climax of ""They Live."" On top of this, the soundtrack is incredible. On top of the score, which covers almost every conceivable genre, the 109 licensed tracks are stellar. Aerosmith, Kendrick Lamar, OutKast, Stan Bush, Junkie XL, Biz Markie... the list goes on. Once again, ""variety"" is the best word that can be used to describe your experience with the music and voice acting.I've saved the worst for last, because it really seems like a trivial complaint in the face of everything else. But it must be said: this game isn't really the best in the graphics department, at least on consoles. While it certainly isn't horrible to look at, the game suffers from some low-res textures in a lot of areas, and the shading in the game is a bit dark, which makes it hard to see every little detail of your custom character at times. It seems to me that the disc is so full of content that it had to take a hit somewhere, and that ""somewhere"" was in the visuals. Again, these are not bad graphics by a long shot, but it certainly isn't as pretty to look at as, say, ""Saints Row The Third.""Hopefully, though, you're not a graphics snob (and if you are, just play it on the PC), because you'd be a fool to pass this game up for such a trivial reason. In all my years of playing video games, no other interactive experience has made me cackle with as much glee, amusement, and unbridled joy as ""Saints Row IV."" It is, from start to explosive finish, something that must be played to be believed. Every little twist and turn of the experience, your expectations are toyed with. Volition, not content to be great at one thing, decided to through almost every genre of game at the wall and see what stuck. Luckily for us, it all stuck, and what we're left with is one of those rare games that I will say, without a doubt, is worth the full 60 bucks.""Saints Row IV"", despite some graphical and technical issues, is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played, and one of this years finest. If you want to bust a gut while busting caps, then this is the game for you.Plot: 10Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 8.5Sound: 10Overall: 9.5","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPWDGYCU9WAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRQN2EM#wasThisHelpful","RSPWDGYCU9WAN","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When you say ""Shin Megami Tensei"", most gamers today will probably respond with ""Persona."" However, the MegaTen brand stretches back to the 80's, and virtually none of the other games are similar to those popular spin-offs. In fact, up until ""Nocturne"" hit the PS2 in the early 2000's, the series exclusively relied on first-person dungeon-crawling, excessive level-grinding, and punishing resource management coupled with elaborate demon training, a mechanic which Nintendo would successfully ape in their ""Pokemon"" games.This is an important introduction, I feel, because ""Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers"" is a straight-up port of a 1997 Sega Saturn game, predating the birth of the ""Persona"" series, and the modern overhaul which would bring the MegaTen franchise into the 21st century. As such, it's a weird transitional piece that, despite its flaws, serves as an interesting peek into what would make the series so famous in the coming years.Amami City is now the most technologically advanced place on the planet, thanks to every household now being connected by a broadband (!) network. Not only that, but people can now visit each other via the internet in a virtual town called ""Paradigm X."" Paradigm X houses movies, online shopping, and forums where people can assume different identities. But there's a sinister evil lurking beneath this seemingly perfect cyber utopia. The sinister corporation behind it is using the code to summon demons, causing them to materialize in the physical world and wreak havoc. As a member of the secretive hacker group Spookies, you must arm yourself with a portable computer and capture demons in order to fight back. Oh, and while you're at it, it might be a good idea to exorcise the demon from your best friend's body, one that's shifted her personality from ""shy and nerdy"" to ""brash and sultry.""As you might have already noticed, this setting is pretty dated by today's standards. Technology is treated like magic, and hackers as wizards able to control it. But concepts such as portable computers and a virtual city, not to mention online shopping and other things of that nature, are already commonplace in today's society, so the mysticism of it may be lost on a modern audience. That being said, the narrative itself is rock-solid. The characters are all very memorable, with the highlight being the protagonist's friend shifting back and forth between personalities, leading to some hilarious conversations with ""herself."" Another cool feature are the ""vision quests"", which put you in control of a character who has deceased in order to gain their knowledge and experience to aid you in your quest. This is a really unique idea, and something that I'd like to see return in newer MegaTen games.Props are also due to Atlus' translation team, which obviously knew that this was one of the sillier MegaTen games, and thus decided to tailor the dialogue accordingly. Therefore, players are treated to subtle references to films such as ""Clerks"", and gamer in-jokes like the infamous ""my body is ready"" meme. All-around, despite the dated silliness, the characters and excellent translation elevate this to the level of newer entries as far as the writing goes.What may be an unwelcome mechanic to fans of more modern RPGs, however, is the gameplay. It's all pretty basic and straightforward. Overworld navigation is handled by a map, and dungeons are first-person, grid-based corridors. Battles are random, and if you want to succeed, you'll have to be prepared to seriously grind levels, unless you want to die within a few turns upon entering a battle. The entire experience of navigation can be summed up in two phrases: ""resource management"" and ""trial and error."" You'll constantly need to manage Magnetite to keep your demons summoned, and you'll die more than a few times trying to figure out enemies' weaknesses and attack patterns. This is one of the easier old-school MegaTen games, true, but that's not saying much when the series is renowned for its punishing difficulty.However, the difficulty is alleviated somewhat by my biggest bone to pick with the game. For this 3DS version, Atlus added in optional ""hacks"" to alter the gameplay. Some of the more convenient perks include being able to summon demons regardless of your party alignment, and being able to see the entire map of a dungeon without exploring it (a lifesaver if you reach the end of the dungeon, then die.) These two features are pretty handy, and don't really rob the game of its challenge at all in my honest opinion. Unfortunately, the other ""hacks"" don't get off as easily.First off, there's one that allows you to see demon types in the game that you haven't even encountered, taking away the joy of discovery gained from grinding through dungeons. Even the super-casual ""Pokemon"" doesn't stoop this low. My biggest concern by far, though, are the difficulty hacks. Sure, you can make the difficulty higher, but let's face it, most people are going to be interested in making the experience less of a grind. And for the first time in series history, they can do this at a moment's notice. If a player is having trouble, they can simply turn on Easy Mode, coast for a bit to grind levels, then switch it back up to normal.For a series that has historically placed a huge emphasis on making a choice and sticking with it as far as difficulty is concerned, why would Atlus choose this game to implement such a feature? Why not wait for the bigger ""Shin Megami Tensei IV"", which undoubtedly has more mainstream appeal than this? I'm going to out on a limb and say that no new player of this series is going to stick with this one for long, and I feel as if this one is intended solely for hardcore fans, i.e. people who would rather deal with the game's difficulty as they're intended to: by dying, grinding, and repeating. Being able to change it on a whim throws the entire balance off. While I will fully admit this may be my bias as a longtime fan speaking, I don't like the inorganic implementation of such a mode, especially considering players can essentially use it to cheat.Aside from this, the gameplay is great. Capturing demons by conversing with and bribing them is as fun and funny as ever, and fusing them in order to create new recruits is immensely rewarding. Ofttimes, I'll find myself hunting dungeons for demons as opposed to items or experience points, just to find the right ingredients for my new creation. From combat to capturing to exploration, everything here is full of depth and has enough entertainment value to last for dozens of hours. While the design is still somewhat rudimentary and archaic, and thus requires some serious commitment to fully understanding, it's really worth the effort.The aesthetics of this game are truly a mixed bag. On the one hand, the art direction is brilliant, with some memorable and unique character designs, and some of the coolest settings in MegaTen history. On the other hand, Atlus forgot to mention that this isn't really a ""remake"" of the original at all. It's a polished, cleaned-up version of a game that is three console generations-old. Aside from the new anime opening, the graphics are virtually untouched from the Saturn game, aside from the fact that they look cleaner due to a higher resolution. What doesn't look clean, though, are the CG cutscenes. They're incredibly dated, and look really cheesy and terrible by today's standards. I'm not a graphical snob, so it doesn't bother me, but it's definitely something to be aware of going into the game. Expect an old-school experience through-and-through, right down to the graphics.That applies to the music as well. Even though the soundtrack has been re-done, the 90's aesthetic remains. It's an energetic blend of fast guitars and blazing synthesizers, brought to us by series veteran Atsushi Kitajo. It's a great soundtrack, with some surprises thrown in (such as the beautiful ""Hotel Goumaden"" theme) to keep you on your toes. Also a nice surprise is the quality of the voice acting, something the series has been really nailing since the release of ""Persona 4."" In my honest opinion, the auditory department of this game is where some of its biggest successes come from.If you go into this game expecting something like ""Persona"", then you might as well look elsewhere. Atlus has released an RPG that's about as old-school as they get, even moreso than this year's ""Etrian Odyssey IV."" While the ""hacks"" are a point of contention for me, and the graphics could have been spruced up a little more, this is still a winner in the end. For those looking for a game with longevity, challenge, and great atmosphere, ""Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers"" fits the bill quite nicely. It's a rollicking, if slightly flawed, RPG thrill-ride, sure to keep you engaged for ages.Plot: 8.5Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 8Sound: 9Overall: 8.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20H9ZQOBUCD3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APBF8A6#wasThisHelpful","R20H9ZQOBUCD3X","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Netflix has this listed under the horror genre, and I feel that it's a good idea to dispel that notion right away. This is the furthest thing from a horror film that I can think of, and the man wielding the chainsaw on the cover only has about 5-10 minutes of screen time. This is a movie based on a novel by master writer Tatsuhiko Takimoto, whose buggest claim to fame is the wonderfully twisted and beautiful ""Welcome To The NHK."" An uplifting, mellow tale of learning to love yourself and the ones around you, ""Negative Happy Chainsaw Edge"" is a surprisingly good film with some issues that are hard to ignore.High-schooler Yosuke is an incredible underachiever, haunted by the death of a close friend who he felt was always better than him. He spends a good portion of his life attempting to ""top"" his dead friend, to no avail. By pure chance, he encounters a mysterious girl named Eri while walking home one night, sitting alone in a park. However, they are not alone for long, because a hooded figure wielding a chain jumps out of the sky and lands in the park. Turns out it's Eri's destiny to fight this ""Chainsaw Man"", and that Yosuke is going to get dragged into doing combat by her side.This may seem like a catchy hook, but action junkies and horror buffs might want to skip out on this. There are only one or two fighting sequences throughout the whole film, the rest devoted to dialogue and the development of interpersonal relationships. We learn more about Yosuke's low self-esteem, about why Eri has to fight ""Chainsaw Man"", that Yosuke's roommate is a failure at everything he tries, and that their landlady is a depressive drunk because nobody pays attention to her. Much like Takimoto's ""NHK"", ""NHCE"" is a movie that presents us with a variety of characters who hit so close to home, it hurts. We've all known underachievers, drunks, and people with past demons they're trying to confront, and this film really creates likable characters whom you'll grow attached to in 109 minutes.Believe it or not, though, this is definitely more of a tragic romantic comedy than anything else. Sure, there are some seriously sad elements at play, but watching Yosuke battle his inner demons to get closer to Eri is a funny and heartwarming yarn. The comedy downplays the mystery elements at work, which don't really begin to make sense until the last 15-20 minutes of the film. It's best to go in expecting a bleak comedy, and let the mystery and fighting sequences jump out and surprise you.That being said, there are a few issues dragging the film down from greatness. First and foremost, it's incredibly obvious that this is an adapted film, because there are numerous characters who feel important, but have no real parts to speak of. They appear when convenient, and you get a basic feel for their character, but you're left with the impression that they had a much bigger role in the source text. That compounds the film's second problem, which is that the lack of a meaningful supporting cast makes the experience drag on a little longer than it ought to, and there are quite a few points that feel like a lead-in to a climax, but end up leading to nothing more than another plot thread. While these weren't egregious errors for me, they may waver the interest in more casual viewers.These issues did not completely hamper my enjoyment of the film, however, and I may go so far as to say that ""Negative Happy Chainsaw Edge"" is one of my new favorite films. It's a refreshing take on the tired ""young love"" trope, and its protagonists are so likable and multifaceted that the weak supporting cast is forgivable. Part action, part comedy, part tragedy, this film has the rare distinction of being like nothing I've ever seen. If you can forgive some of the more draggy aspects, you're sure to enjoy this unique and fun little gem of a film.Grade: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VNJRTPNBRAX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030ZIZRW#wasThisHelpful","R1VNJRTPNBRAX3","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while, a series comes along that shakes you up, along with everything else around you. This series pretty much ruins anything you could potentially enjoy over the next year or so, because you'll always be comparing whatever you watch to it. These series include classics like ""Evangelion"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"", along with contemporary gems such as ""Welcome to the NHK"" and ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya."" Joining that pantheon of classic titles is ""Kids on the Slope"", which anybody who enjoys living and breathing is sure to love, regardless of whether they like anime or not.Set in 1966, the series follows Kaoru, an introverted and bookish high school boy who is secretly skilled at the piano. However, his relatives seems to frown upon it, and thus, he focuses solely on studying. That all changes, though, when he meets Sentaro, a hotheaded boy with a bad reputation due to his somewhat violent disposition. But after being defended from bullies, Kaoru begins to see that Sentaro's reputation isn't deserved. They become fast friends, even more so when we learn that Sentaro is a drummer, and needs a pianist for a jazz group he plays with.This should set the stage for a 1960's, ""K-On!""-esque tale of attempting to rise to the top of the musical world. However, that falls to the wayside quite quickly. This is really a story of first love, of clashing cultures, and of kids forced to deal with abandonment issues. It's human drama of the first degree, and while there is some optimism to be found, it has a bitter tinge of realism permeating the entire experience. The square focus of the show is on appreciating the little gifts life gives you, while learning how to cope with the fact that one must typically suffer before gaining those gifts.What's really impressive about this narrative is how many social issues it touches on. This might be the first anime I've seen that really takes advantage of its time period. Post-war anti-American sentiments are hinted at, as are issues dealing with Japanese citizens following Christianity. Politics and religion are thrown into the stew, and simmered to perfection along with the other narrative elements. No matter who you are, you'll be hard-pressed to not find something in this series that is relevant to your life.Little shock, then, that this comes from anime master Shinichiro Watanabe, director of classics ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Samurai Champloo"", who has exhibited this penchant for humanity before. However, I would argue that he does it best in this series. While ""Bebop"" is still my absolute favorite, Watanabe greatly benefits from honing in on a smaller story with less plot threads to worry about. This lets him flesh out his characters much more, and in fact, they become far less archetypal than any of his past ones. For the first time in a while, I genuinely cared about an anime love triangle (there's a big one that takes most of the series to tell), and wasn't left groaning like I do at so many romance anime. It was undoubtedly because I had grown attached to all of the characters, and couldn't stand to see even one of them get hurt. Truly a master of his craft, this director proves that he can deliver a slice-of-life tale just as compelling as anything Kyoto Animation has ever put out.""Bebop"" fans will be overjoyed to hear the musical stylings of Yoko Kanno once again. However, like Watanabe, she reigns in her typical style to deliver something more distilled and focused. Instead of toying with several different genres, she focuses on doing one thing very well, with stellar results. You'd better enjoy jazz, because that's essentially all you'll be hearing. From new cuts made for the soundtrack, to excellent covers of old standards, Kanno shows a deftness with the style that's altogether unexpected and wonderful. Little nods to other popular styles of music of the time are also nice. This soundtrack is sandwiched between YUKI's excellent opener, and Motohiro Hata's solid closer, making for a well-rounded and killer musical experience.Rounding it out is great animation, delivered by a studio founded by the ""God of Manga"", Tezuka Productions. Now, this studio rarely does anything that isn't based on a preexisting Tezuka work, and when they do, it tends to be something they feel confident in. Thank the heavens, then, that they felt confident enough to lend their hand to this masterpiece. The animation is positively gorgeous, never dropping in quality throughout the entire series. Environments are all period-accurate, as are all of the character and vehicle designs. Everything moves at a fluid and crisp rate, making small things like playing a piano seem positively exhilarating. A lot of the time, an anime series will have great animation at the beginning, crap in the middle, and good again at the end. Thankfully, this is not the case with ""Kids"", which is a visual treat up until the tearjerker of a finale.Most anime released last year left me fairly cold; there were only a few series that really stuck out to me. But among those choice few, ""Kids On The Slope"" was by far the best. In fact, it may be the best anime of the past few years. After all, I feel confident in asserting that this is a classic of the highest caliber, to be remembered with greats like the aforementioned ""Evangelion"" and ""Cowboy Bebop."" A tale of bittersweet humanity told through excellent music and depicted with killer animation, ""Kids On The Slope"" is one of anime's rare masterpieces. Whether you pay for it or find it streaming, don't miss out on this one.Grade: A+","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF46EAHLQNYOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6DTGLO#wasThisHelpful","RF46EAHLQNYOO","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Historically, everything in the ""Ring"" media franchise has been pretty rock-solid. The main films are classics, and Koji Suzuki's original novel is on par with many things Stephen King has written. The various manga adaptations have also been entertaining, and from hearsay, the TV drama was solid. Heck, even the Dreamcast game, ""Ring: Terror's Realm"" is so bad that it's actually brilliant as a comedic experience.So when somebody finally decided to update the infamous antagonist Sadako to be relevant to a modern audience (read: not in a videotape), I was reasonably excited. But while ""Sadako 3D"" does manage to succeed in being a relatively frightening horror flick with an interesting backstory, its confusing placement in the continuity and the lukewarm plot make it the weakest link of the series.""Sadako"" follows a young school-teacher who is haunted by a traumatic childhood experience in which she was almost killed by a psychotic man wielding a knife. To save herself and her classmates, she let out a deafening scream which shattered glass and killed the attacker. She was then shunned by her peers, with the exception of one boy who ended up becoming her fiance. Fast forward to the present, where rumor has it that a mysterious video is circulating on the internet that acts as a virus of sorts, and forces people into suicide. When one of her students is afflicted, the teacher finds herself embroiled in the story of how the video virus came to be, and tries to stop it before it consumes the world by infecting the entire internet.Kudos should be given to the concept of the film, directed by series newbie Tsutomu Hanabusa (who also wrote the script, along with veteran horror writer Yoshinobu Fujioka). While it was adapted from the newest Suzuki novel, ""S"", the fact remains that Sadako being a Trojan is a terrifying prospect. Throughout the film, we see her hand springing forth from a smartphone, and her hair raining down from a giant display on the side of a building in Tokyo. Even though the originals are terrifying, we need to face the facts: nobody's scared of VHS tapes anymore. By making this based upon a current technology, and referencing contemporary issues, the writers have successfully made this effective to a modern audience.But is it actually scary? Honestly, the horror in this is a mixed bag, mainly comprised of cheap scare tactics. Some of the instances of Sadako appearing are genuinely frightening, and will make you jump out of your seat. But as the movie wears on, she loses her personal touch and becomes more of a force, simply appearing on the biggest screens possible. This is a perfect example of the phrase ""size doesn't matter, it's all in how you use it."" While seeing the ravenheaded and creepy cutie come out of aforementioned giant display is awe-inspiring, it's never really scary. Hanabusa ultimately fails at crafting a suspenseful atmosphere, and the thrills come from jump scares as oppose to actual suspense. Again, though, some of the instances of her appearing are pretty creepy (one scene of a hand springing forth from a smart phone sent chills down my spine), so people who are easily scared regardless might wanna look away for the first 30 minutes or so.Unfortunately, the horror and plot both fall apart miserably in the latter quarter of the movie, as it devolves into a C-grade supernatural serial killer drama. While I won't spoil things, I will say that the reason for Sadako being resurrected is laughable, and the ""horror"" of a psychotic individual killing women and throwing them in a well to bring her back to life isn't terrifying, because we've seen it done before and done better. The fact of that there's a human antagonist makes the film significantly less mysterious. Not only that, the character himself is poorly acted and comes across as a prissy loser as opposed to a believable villain. Another thing fans might notice is that the latter half of the film severs continuity with the original films, making its billing of ""The Ring 3"" in other countries completely inaccurate. This should be treated as a side-story, or dare I say it, a reboot (ugh.)But what really unravels the suspense is the supernatural threat itself. When we first get to see what we think is Sadako outside of the screen, she's unremarkable and contrived. Her legs are two or three times the size of her torso, and she runs around on all four limbs like a deranged insect, and can clone herself. Not only that, but she now has a giant mouth, roars, and drinks people's blood from their throats. Yes, Sadako, the prototypical ""creepy Japanese girl"" has ironically become a cliche Hollywood beast, devoid of any aura of mystery or terror. Even though you eventually find out that those are just monsters the real Sadako (who has a brilliant speaking role this time around) created, the fact remains that the filmmakers had to rely on CGI monsters to be scary, as opposed to actually BEING scary.Oh, I might as well add that the ""video itself"" is utterly disappointing, nowhere nearly as creepy as the original footage we've seen in previous entries.What makes the movie tolerable enough is the camerawork, which is surprisingly good, a shock considering how unfortunate the rest of the film is. There are distinct usages of colors to evoke moods during particular scenes, such as the blues and greens when the protagonist is running from the unremarkable ""Sadako"" clones. Pretty much everything in the movie is interesting to look at, and while the script does nothing to give off any atmosphere, the visuals are appealing enough to keep viewers engaged. Extra points go to the terse score and effective usage of sound effects.If you're able to turn your brain off and just be engaged for the visual and auditory spectacle, you may have a good time. Just try to ignore the cheap, bad-CGI moments that blatantly try to ""come out of the screen"" at you.Also good is the acting, the most strong performance of which comes from Satomi Ishihara in the lead role. As a victim of past trauma, braving her fears in order to save the man she loves, she's incredibly convincing and an absolute joy to watch. Her performance is incredibly nuanced, and saves the film from being entirely bad. Koji Seto is also a delight as her sweet-natured boyfriend, charming and adorable as he helps her through her various struggles. He's quite the believable character, and I think many men (and women, even) will be able to relate to him. Another great performance comes from Ryosei Tayama as a bumbling, but good-natured, detective who has a poor grasp on anything related to technology, providing some necessary comic relief.Lastly, when you finally get to the ""true form"" of Sadako, played by the pretty Ai Hashimoto, you're treated to one of the most harrowing performances of a screen villain in recent memory. For the first time in the series, you see Sadako speak, and get a hint of her true motivations. It's truly a powerful moment, and makes you wonder why the idiotic serial killer subplot was even there in the first place. She's only on screen for a few moments, but Hashimoto is excellent, and I hope we see more of her in future entries.It's good that most of the actors are strong, because one in particular is so unremarkable that he would drag the entire film down if he had even a few moments more of screen-time. This would be Yusuke Yamamoto, who plays the film's primary antagonist. His performance is incredibly poor, coming across like a cheap villain from a bad telenovela. From what I've read, Yamamoto is quite the charmer as a ""good boy"" type of character, and my advice to him would be to stick to that.When we watch ""Sadako 3D"", what are we left with? Sadly, not enough. There are thrills to be had, and this is still better than most of the flicks that pass for ""horror"" these days. Strong performances, nice cinematography and a good score make a compelling argument for checking out this film. But that doesn't excuse a plot which becomes contrived halfway through, nor the awful performance of a key character who shouldn't exist, or the deceptive desecration of a legendary screen presence. Extra points should also be taken off for the lack of clarity in regards to where this exactly fits into the canon, if it even does at all, or if it's yet another reboot.To modern audiences, this film will probably be passable and entertaining enough. But for people who know what the ""Ring"" series is truly capable of, and know that it can deliver excellent atmosphere and impeccable storytelling with a truly threatening menace, it will be a harsh disappointment. Ultimately, ""Sadako 3D"" is an acceptable thriller, but a tepid addition to such a great series.Grade: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HA60ZMM0T7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOUXNS6#wasThisHelpful","R36HA60ZMM0T7L","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might have been the harshest critic of the new direction Crystal Dynamics decided to take ""Tomb Raider."" There are several angry posts to my name across the web, talking about why this game would fail, and how it was a desecration to the franchise. After all, I grew up with Lara's series, and in fact, ""Tomb Raider II"" was the first video game I ever played. To this day, I thought that this would be a simplification of the timeless series, and a desperate attempt to make the series fit in with newcomers. Thankfully, I have been proven wrong. ""Tomb Raider"" is one of the venerable heroine's finest outings, and possibly the best action game since ""Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.""We begin with Lara being trapped on an island, searching for her friends and being pursued by a menacing cult. But this isn't the cocky, oddly-proportioned character we're used to; this is before her official tomb raiding days, and the first major expedition she sets out on. As such, she is inexperienced and vulnerable, and the game chronicles her ascension from scared teen to powerful warrior. Now, you might think the trailers give away the plot, but you'd be dead wrong. The story is every bit as strange and wonderful as some of the earlier games, containing unpredictable twists and surprising supernatural elements. It would be a crime to spoil it, but let's just that fans of the old games need not worry; Crystal Dynamics (developers of Legend through Underworld) still know what this franchise is all about, narrative-wise, and they hit the nail right on the head.Special props should go to Rihanna Pratchett, writer of the woefully underrated ""Heavenly Sword"", for making Lara into one of the most empowering female role models ever crafted. Even in her weakest states, she is never a victim, always resourceful and one step ahead of everyone else. Through the story, we see her learn from mistakes, and turn into what we typically think of as Lara Croft. Special little nods the series' roots, right down to the origin of her signature silver pistols, add in flavor to her character, and turn into a much deeper protagonist than she has ever been. Even as somebody who loves the old character, I must say that Pratchett has actually made me prefer this interpretation of her. Full-speed ahead with this new Lara, I say; she's smart, cheeky, and powerful, which is exactly what she's supposed to be.Fans' biggest concern about this new entry, however, was undoubtedly the gameplay. The seemingly liberal inclusion of Quick Time Events, and the deceptively linear design of showcased levels both indicated an unwelcome change. However, it turns out we were only drip-fed bits and pieces of different levels. The game itself is an entirely different matter, because it is teeming with as many secrets as the old games, if not more. While it is easy to simply follow the set path, there are numerous alternate routes to pursue in search of loot, and even entire optional tombs. These tombs are more in line with the classic puzzles we're used to, fun little mind teasers that are a great distraction for old-school fans. Whether you want to get to the point or indulge in some side quests, this game has got you covered.As far as the gameplay itself is concerned, Crystal Dynamics has unquestionably changed the formula for the better. Platforming is now much more tight and urgent than ever before, requiring the precision fans are used to. While it is significantly easier than past entries, the sheer creativity that went into the dynamic set pieces more than make up for it, and it isn't necessarily as streamlined as the demos make it seem. Attention still must be paid at all time, and once you get past the initial 2 to 3 hours, the game stops holding your hand and expects you to dive head-first into somewhat tricky platforming, fully prepared to punish you with brutal deaths if you fail.The biggest overhaul by far, though, is in the combat department. Now, even as a fan of the series, combat in ""Tomb Raider"" has always... well, it's always kind of sucked. Even the improvements in Legend couldn't quite find a way to balance platforming and shooting up enemies. However, the developers have learned from their mistakes, creating a seamless blend of platforming and TPS mechanics that must be played to be believed. There's also a leveling component that really makes or breaks the combat; your survival is dependent on scrounging for salvage and strengthening your weapons. Most games mess this mechanic up pretty badly with upgrades that are seemingly meaningless, but this is pleasantly a whole different bag altogether.Even more impressive is how important each weapon is, some being required to solve puzzles and progress the game. My personal favorite is the bow, which can be used as a distraction, a stealth weapon, a capable frontal assault companion, or a key to burning open pathways. Oh, yes, and it can be used to choke enemies from behind. This is just one example of the versatility weapons have in this game. Heck, even the climbing axe ends up becoming a lethal tool of destruction...Graphically, the game excels. While some may argue that the rendering power is not on par with some other AAA titles around today, it only takes one look at the brilliant art direction to sway non-believers. The mysterious island and all of its secrets are a marvel to behold, a mixture of jungle, forest, and even desert-esque canyons. Shanty towns and elaborate Asian temples alike comprise the architecture of the island, and ominous tunnels range from wet rock to a disgusting river of blood and corpses. The key word here is ""variety"", really, as most locations tend to not look the same one bit. Older entries had to span multiple countries in order to convey a sense of changed locale, but this time around, they only needed one island to create a living, breathing world. It's a wonder to behold, and one of the most unforgettable video game environments ever crafted.Soundscapes are another strong point here. The background noise is convincing, with the caws of birds seemingly surrounding you, and the distant war cries of enemies preparing you for battle. You'll always be sucked right into the action, regardless of the situation. Ditto for the score, which is surprisingly similar to the early games; it's tense and dramatic, but always has an element of mystique to it. It is one of the rare video game soundtracks that doesn't simply blend in, but stands out and demands you pay attention to it.The new voice of Lara is also wonderful, and I daresay the best portrayal done yet. Sure, we see the frightened and timid girl advertisements seem to highlight, but we get hints of what is to come with the character. Moments of wry sarcasm between her and her shipmates, as well as her cheeky observations and bold proclamations of assault on her enemies, are pure 90's ""Tomb Raider."" The game lets you know what to expect in future entries, and this is due in large part to this fantastic performance. Kudos to Camilla Luddington for a performance which is sure to be lavished with awards in the coming months.As mentioned above, I was a complete non-believer with this entry. I feared that one of my favorite franchises was cashing in on cheap gameplay mechanics and a weak plot, while shedding what old-school fans adored about the games in the first place. Luckily, I was proven to be a complete fool. Square Enix has released a game that not only reminds me why I fell for Lara and her exploits, but why I love video games as well. The story is a brilliant tour-de-force, the gameplay is perfect, it's a feast for the eyes and ears, and the protagonist is one of the best in a very long time. Everything about this game, from top to bottom, is positively flawless. There is not a single ill word I can speak of the game, whatsoever.Filled with enough nods to the series' history to satiate diehards, but with enough innovation to snag newcomers, this is a game that shows Crystal Dynamics is the perfect developer for this household name series. ""Tomb Raider"" is an instant classic, and should be a benchmark for which all future action games are played. It is utterly perfect on every possible level, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.Story: 10Gameplay: 10Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 10","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3PRSK65DYB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FS8LYK#wasThisHelpful","RL3PRSK65DYB2","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first four ""Die Hard"" films have something in common. No, not the fact that things blow up, or that Bruce Willis is going to say funny things. Underneath all of the explosions, gunshots, and profanity lies a strong character, interesting plots, and memorable set pieces. This is why it is incredibly disheartening that I saw ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" less than 24 hours ago, yet can barely remember any of it. There were some explosions, a helicopter... maybe Willis said something funny once? Perhaps twice?I'm not quite sure, but what I am sure of is that this is one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Everybody involved should be embarrassed about this miserable abomination of a film, and request that it be removed from their resume. The plot is garbage, it's xenophobic and homophobic, and to top it all off, the action isn't even inspired. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a disgrace to a once great franchise.We kick things off with John McClane searching for his son in Russia, who was magically never mentioned for four films. In that span of time, John McClane Jr. (ooh, original!) has apparently become a degenerate and been thrown in prison. But as we quickly find out, he's actually a CIA Agent! And Bruce Willis has to help him, but is employing meatheaded tactics for espionage missions! It's a giant culture clash! Oh, the hilarious shenanigans! Mix it up with some classic ""American trying to speak a foreign language"" and ""like father, like son"" gags, add in some monosyllabic tough guy dialogue, and you've got a surefire recipe for cinematic gold.Except you don't. The story in this movie is the narrative equivalent of an overflowed gutter: you're seeing nothing but ugly mush of something that was maybe, at some point, kind of pretty. Dialogue is simplistic and unfunny, the narrative is derivative and moronic, and there's a disgusting gay stereotype of a character. Nothing even remotely original occurs in the span of this film, and I feel genuinely sorry for Willis and all others involved having to participate in a movie that was seemingly penned by a third-grader with access to the internet.However, something about the story is more infuriating than the rest of it, and it deserves note: the villains. Namely, the fact that their goal is never stated. All we know is that they are Russian, and that they might want uranium. No, really, that's it. That's all they give us. We're just supposed to assume that a Russian scientist wants uranium left in Chernobyl for nefarious purposes, for no reason other than the fact that he's a Russian scientist. Oh, and there's the little fact that the American father and son beat out the Russian father and daughter, therefore adding sexism onto the laundry list of this film's dubious achievements.But maybe you don't care about plot. Maybe you're in it for big-budget action. Well, get ready for disappointment, because the action sequences are some of the most dull and uninspired I've ever seen. Yawn with apathy as Bruce Willis defies physics in a car! Play ""Angry Birds"" as he jumps off a thirty story building and lives! And go to the bathroom as a villain falls into a vertically-rotating helicopter blade as it traverses a horizontal plane! Heck, while you're in there, you might as well stay out and go home, because this trash won't get any better.What really tops it off is that the budget feels nonexistent. The cinematography is a joke, some shots looking like they might as well be stock footage. The overused CGI is pretty hokey too, becoming downright cheesy and ludicrous about halfway throughout the movie. That is, if you haven't fallen asleep already, which the grating and jarring sound effects will try to prevent quite frequently. On a technical level, this movie is a joke, and makes me actually want to sit through a Michael Bay movie because of how terrible it is.Some may think this review indicates that I hate plotless action movies, and I'll have you know that I love the ""Expendables"" franchise, and pretty much anything with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Statham taking the top billing. This movie has not earned my ire because it is an action movie with no plot; it's earned it because it's an action movie with poor action and a plot that tries to be emotionally engaging but fails in a spectacular fashion. This is insipid cinematic garbage of the lower caliber, and should put a nail in the coffin of writer Skip Woods, whose past credits includes the awful ""Hitman"" film.Now, I laughed my way through this movie, so if you want to pay ten bucks to laugh at how terrible a film is, then by all means, go see this. But if you want to go see it because you have fond memories of the old films, then you deserve to know that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a failure on every possible level. It is a bottom-of-the-barrel carnival ride with an awful plot and lame action sequences, with no funny one-liners or interesting villains to speak of. When the year ends, I have a strong feeling that this will be a surefire candidate to take the Razzy for ""Worst Picture.""Perhaps John McClane needs to ""yippee ki-yay"" into the sunset... and a retirement home.Grade: F","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCTEOJHLF7OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUMT2#wasThisHelpful","R1OCTEOJHLF7OL","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fire Emblem"" fans have had it tough in America, and people who have wanted to get into the franchise have arguably had it tougher. After all, most of the games are printed in limited quantities, and once they run out, it's game over on anybody else who wants to legally obtain them. While it's unfortunate that Nintendo has once again botched the release of this newest entry, those who can get their hands on it are in for the time of their lives. ""Fire Emblem: Awakening"" is a game that, in all likelihood, go on to be a classic remembered for years down the line.After creating a male or female character of their choosing, players are thrown into a war between nations, complete with swordsmen, magic casters, and other familiar types of fantasy warriors. Your character has amnesia, and is taken in by a young man named Chrom and his sister Lissa, who lead a peacekeeping group known as the Shepherds. Joining them, you find yourself caught in an epic saga that spans multiple generations (a la the ""Record of Aghrest War"" series), continuing well into the lives of Chrom and Lissa's children.Without giving any spoilers, I can firmly say that, from what I have played, this is one of the single best narratives in an SRPG, distancing itself from the quirk found in titles like ""Disgaea"" or ""Luminous Arc."" Despite moments of genuine comedy, this is a story that is meant to be taken seriously, creating a world ravaged by war, and making players care about the people caught in the middle. With memorable new characters, as well as the triumphant return of fan favorite Marth, Nintendo has released one of their rare games in which players become emotionally invested in the story, and attached to the characters housed within, no matter how minor.This narrative strength ties well into the gameplay. Before detailing the specifics of the mechanics, it's fair to warn newcomers that, unless you select the mode deactivating this, almost of all your units can die permanently. That means if you've been romantically pairing two characters, that love can be tragically cut short by one wrong move on your part. My feelings about this feature aside, it adds a whole level of depth and meaning to the game. Again, though, those who balk at that concept can turn this feature off in ""Awakening"", making it easier to pick harder difficulty levels by alleviating the stress of life management.Now, the best part about the gameplay though is that no matter what you choose, you're going to be in for a good time. This is a standard grid-based, turn-based strategy game, complete with battles that can last well over an hour, elaborate strategies, and slow realizations that your strategy had just enough flaws to get you killed. People who haven't ever played an SRPG may be able to think of it as a more elaborate version of a chess match. And much like that famous board game, you won't be blaming the opposition for your failure. This game does a great job of making players realize that it's not a matter of the AI being hard that results in a lose; it's a matter of you screwing up. With in-battle level-ups, players are forced to pick and choose which units to use and which to let fall to the wayside, trying to figure out the best one for different situations. It's deceptively simple at first, but victory hinges upon a player's innate strategic capabilities.Returning players are treated to two main features new to the series, both of which are crucial to survival. The first of these is standing two units next to each other on the board in order to gain stat boosts; this has been done in other SRPGs, sure, but it's implemented very well here. In fact, one could even say that it's essential to winning battles. The other new feature is just as important, however, which is the action of two units doubling up on the same square. One takes the lead, the other provides support, and players have to switch according to the opponent or if the other unit's health begins to run low. This provides all sorts of new possibilities. Have a lancer about to square off with an axeman, the former's weakness, but still want to level that unit up? Team up with a swordsman and provide supports. Want to level a weak unit without the constant threat of dying? Have a healer on standby.The strategic possibilities in ""Awakening"" are virtually limitless, mainly thanks to the aforementioned new abilities. In a gaming landscape where SRPGs are failing to evolve and innovate, Nintendo has proven triumphant with one of the finest strategy experiences ever crafted.Things in the audio/visual department are pretty exceptional too. Each battle plays out in an exciting cutscene in which players can control the camera, or even see the battle from the unit's first-person perspective. Cutscenes which drive the narrative forward use the same polygonal models, coupled with some really exceptional character artwork speaking through text boxes. Also utilized are beautiful cinematic cutscenes, which are fully animated and rendered using a sort of cel-shaded animation technique. These, as well as the non-cinematic cutscenes, all look great in 2D, but for one of the rare times, I actually prefer playing this game with my 3D Slider turned all the way up. This is a gorgeous game in 3D, with some seriously convincing effects; one level's snowflakes were popping out so much that I could almost feel my hands getting chilly. Much like ""Paper Mario: Sticker Star"", ""Awakening"" is a sign that developers finally seemed to have gotten the grasp of using the 3DS properly. This is paired with an orgasmic soundtrack and voice acting that is pretty solid, if not a bit minimal, to make a package that has great gameplay, great visuals, and excellent music.Nintendo has yet another notch on its belt of triple-A titles on its handheld, and it's another welcome reminder of who is firmly winning the handheld ""war."" With SpotPass features (unit sharing? Heck yeah!) and numerous downloadable missions and character packs to come (Roy, another fan favorite, will be included), this is a game that should be in every 3DS owner's library. Actually, this game is so superbly crafted that I daresay it merits buying the system just to experience it!Tailored towards newcomers, strategy gamers, and franchise diehards alike, ""Fire Emblem: Awakening"" is an incredibly experience that is unparalleled by anything else on the market currently. Everything about it is impeccably designed, and if you're able to get a copy, then I fervently recommend you do so.Plot: 9Gameplay: 9Graphics: 9Sound: 9.5Overall: 9.25","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILYN7DG74CLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKIPBNS#wasThisHelpful","RILYN7DG74CLO","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attached to this film is a trailer for ""World War Z"", an adaptation of Max Brooks' excellent novel which looks to be a shoe-in for one of the year's worst films. Packed with overabundant CGI, a contrived plot, and seeming to be lacking in the depth that made the source material so great, it's pretty indicative of the current state of zombie films as a whole. What a relief it is, then, that ""Warm Bodies"" is one of the most charming and original takes on the sub-genre I've seen in a while, and something I would heartily recommend to anybody with an open mind.The plot, based on a novel by the same name, takes place from the perspective of ""R"", a young, attractive zombie with a witty inner monologue and desire to be more human. Enter Julia, a girl whom he lays eyes on after killing her boyfriend. He takes her back to his home (a refashioned airplane that looks like a hipster heaven), and slowly begins to become more human as his heart begins to beat again. Soon, this begins to spread like a virus among the zombie populace (ironic, I know), and they begin to regain consciousness. However, the humans still won't forgive and forget, and the real threat to both the zombies and humans, terrifying skeletal creatures called ""Bonies"", begin to pose serious problems. Will the seemingly doomed romance last?You'll be asking yourself that question throughout, which is what makes this film such a winner. Nothing is ever really certain, as it is an experience that is all at once refreshing and unpredictable. At any given moment, something seems as if it's going to go wrong with ""R"" and Julia, and you're left biting your nails in suspense not from horror, but from the desire to see the relationship work. This relationship is the beating heart of the film, and honestly, this is what makes it such an enjoyable watch.That said, it might not be for everybody. Much like many cult films (think ""They Live""), ""Warm Bodies"" can slow to a crawl just as much as it can speed up to a fever pitch. While some people, like myself, may appreciate the interactions between a human and a zombie, and the unique dilemmas brought about by those, others may find these to be slow and tedious. This is understandable, and I can't fault people for that. This isn't as peppy and constantly funny as the trailers may lead you to believe; its tone is more one of ambiguity, and for some, that may be too demanding.What everybody should appreciate about this quirky little piece, though, is the excellent acting on all fronts. Nicholas Houlten as the lead is a delight, his ability to balance out his inner monologue with convincingly ""dead trying to be alive"" acting proving to be a winning combo. Teresa Palmer plays an equally as convincing love interest, acting pretty much exactly how somebody falling in love with the living dead would act. Special props should be given to Analeigh Tipton, who plays a charmingly ditsy best friend to Julie, and John Malkovich (what is HE doing here?!) as Julie's literally militaristic anti-zombie father. The acting drives the film, really, and if one actor was replaced, it just wouldn't be as good.Tied to together with some neat cinematography, which is clever enough to ignore the lacking special effects, and a lovably atypical soundtrack, ""Warm Bodies"" is destined to be one of this generation's cult classics. Not for everybody, sure, but those who like it will adore it, and it may likely become one of their favorite films, and one of their favorite cinematic romances.Now, how did their hearts start beating again anyhow...?Overall: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJEL4C0CM6JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220BLG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJEL4C0CM6JH","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My pulse is pounding. My nerves are shot. The sheets on my bed are soaked in sweat, and it's nearing 4 in the morning. What was supposed to be a nice session of gaming before I went to bed has turned into one of the most immensely stressful experiences in my life. Walking on eggshells, I managed to scramble to my computer, and now, I'm going to attempt to tell you why Griptonite's ""Shinobi"", a reboot of Sega's classic franchise, will keep making you yell out in pure rage... then keep you coming back for more.But first, a little bit of background. You're playing as Jiro Musashi, father of old series protagonist Joe Musashi, as you seek revenge for your destroyed village. Somehow, you end up getting sucked into a time warp of sorts, and wind up far into the future. Next thing you know, you're battling not only ninjas, but soldiers with lasers, giant robots, and heck, even armored choppers. This admittedly nonsensical plot is told in mostly dialogue-free animated cutscenes, which are pretty to look at, even if they aren't in 3D. Obviously, the dev team is having a bit of fun with the series, and them hamming up some of the elements (humorous loading screen prompts and a tongue-in-cheek series history guide are clear indicators of this) makes for a pretty fun, if shallow, narrative experience.However, players won't necessarily be in this one for the plot. Anybody who's picked up one of the Genesis-era ""Shinobi"" games will tell you one thing right off the bat: these games are brutal. Back in their heyday, gamers went to their local stores and plopped down fifty bucks for game not because of multiplayer or narrative progression or celebrity endorsement, but because they wanted challenge and longevity. They wanted the satisfaction of mastering a game, through brutal trial and error. While ""Dark Souls"" kind of gets this thrill, they dwell too much on the punishment as opposed the reward, which is still good in its own right, and has a few nagging bugs holding it back. However, Griptonite has officially nailed what it means to be old-school: rewarding, inventive, and so hard you'll want to break your 3DS over your knee and cry in a corner.Make no mistake, this is no reboot that simplifies the game for newer players. You'll have to have a working knowledge of side-scrollers from the early 90's, as well as the patience required to play them, in order to really ""get"" what makes this game so great. Every inventive level, from futuristic cities to bamboo-laden forests, will keep you constantly alert for 20 to 30 minute increments each. You will need to memorize every enemy location, every item location, every sequence of every trap... heck, you'll even need to memorize and measure what jumps to use where. You won't be able to go through most levels in one go. Expect to be stuck retrying the same 30 minutes, over and over again, for about 2 to 3 hours at a time before you finally hit the final boss... which will probably kill you, and force you to do it again. This game is unforgiving, and has absolutely no checkpoint system whatsoever (unless you're playing on Easy, which gives you infinite lives.)What sets this brutal level of difficulty apart from other contemporaries, however, is how well the controls work. Everything about the gameplay is tight, accurate, and ensures that the player is completely in control of every minuscule action they make. Jumps are as long or as short as you want them to be; running always stops when your finger is off the analogue stick; blocking only works when you hit it at the exact instant an enemy attack hits you, and never misses a beat if used correctly. If you die by falling, being hit by an enemy, or anything of the sort, you'll only have yourself to blame. And if an enemy pops out of nowhere and kills you, that's just because you haven't played the level enough times to remember where they're coming from.Jiro has a nice arsenal at his disposal, and you'll have to use it wisely. Of course, you have a katana, but you'll only be using this for desperate times or for calculated attacks on specific enemies; hacking and slashing will get you instantly killed. You have an infinite amount of kunai (throwing knives), but they can only fire in a rapid five-throw burst once, after which you'll be counting the seconds between each thrown. Kunai can also be thrown in a jumping attack, which throws a whole set of them in front of you; planning this attack is crucial, because it leaves you incredibly vulnerable, so planning trajectory is key. Last but not least are your elemental attacks, which take up different portions of the screen depending on which ones you use. Some situations call for these specifically, so don't waste them on smaller enemies; if you do, you'll be trekking through a level for the umpteenth time before you know it.Now, all that being said, don't let the difficulty scare you away. The cutscenes are great, the environments are clever, and the game just flows so nicely that you'll want to keep playing. Perseverance and patience are mandatory, but if you can give those, then you'll have a blast with the game. Personally, I haven't played a game this rewarding in years, and every time you beat a level, you'll feel more of a sense of accomplishment than you did from the last 20 generic shooters you beat.Unfortunately, despite how neat the levels are, the graphics being used to render them are simply not pretty. The sprites are fairly blocky, and there are jagged edges on everything, even with the 3D turned off. This is obviously something Sega was unsure about, and didn't throw loads of money into. While everything is nice to look at simply because of the great art direction, a closer look indicates a game that was starved for a budget, and simply had to use a ""cel-shaded"" art style to cover up the fact that the graphics really just aren't that pretty. They do not, however, hinder enjoyment of the game in any way, shape, or form; after all, did you really care about how 16-bit ""Sonic"" or ""Mario"" looked just so long as they were fun? Thought so.Making up for the graphics in some capacity is the music, which is an interesting mix of techno and traditional Asian music. Most of the background music will be lodged in your head at some point, and the composer did a really great job of making tracks that evoke memories of bleary-eyed gaming sessions on our old consoles.""Shinobi"" wants you dead, and if you want to get the most out of it, you'd better expect to pay it some blood as a tribute. However, despite a virtually non-existent plot and some iffy graphics, it's a fun experience that's incredibly memorable due to how much it forces you to learn about a level and its mechanics thoroughly before you can trek through it efficiently. It's a love letter to a time when games didn't need to be fancy in order to be good, when you bought games for the gameplay and not for trivial aesthetics. Just don't expect this to be a ninja game for little Timmy to play on his 3DS, and you'll be fine.While others may be turned off by the lack of plot, the rough graphics, and the borderline insane difficulty level, there is a group who will absolutely adore ""Shinobi."" It's not a perfect game by any means, but it is perfect at what it's trying to do: kick your butt and keep you coming back for more. Relentlessly frustrating and fun in equal amounts, Griptonite's reboot to a cult classic series is one of the most rewarding experiences for seasoned gamers on the 3DS, and on the gaming market in general.Plot: 7Gameplay: 9Graphics: 6Sound: 9Overall: 8","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0R45GK8NYAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052WG9II#wasThisHelpful","R2S0R45GK8NYAM","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ninja Theory, developer of the brilliant ""Heavenly Sword"" and ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"", has one of the worst positions in the industry right now. Despite Capcom giving them full graces to do what they want with the perpetually popular ""Devil May Cry"" franchise, they have an angry herd of gamers with a disdain for change refusing to play their breakthrough game because of several moronic, petty reasons. The biggest one of these is that Dante no longer has white hair, and that it's not Japanese enough, and... well, you get the point. These talented men and women have put years of effort into this project, and people aren't biting because of the protagonist's haircut. Ahh, don't you love gamers sometimes?It's a shame, though, really. Those people aren't playing this game because of a silly little bowl cut, and consequently, are missing out on one of the best, most explosive and politically potent games in recent years. ""DmC: Devil May Cry"" is brilliant on virtually every possible level, and for those who don't give a donkey's rear end about hairstyles and just want a great game, it's simply a must-play.Set in an alternate universe to the previous entries, ""DmC"" follows demon hunter Dante, a rambunctious young man who enjoys threesomes, pizza, and parading around in the nude. Imagine his surprise when he finds out that he's actually an angel-demon half-breed, and that a demon lord runs the world's biggest bank, and that half-breeds are the only ones who can stop such a powerful foe. Further exacerbating this problem is the fact that the city he lives in is, quite literally, trying to kill him, and routinely changes forms and coughs up demonic foes to put an end to his demon hunting days. Add in a long-lost brother, a graffiti-spraying witch, and enemies that consist of soda companies and corrupt news organizations, and you've got a zany plot full of twists and turns.There are two elements that make the story such a winner, and the first one of these is simply Dante himself. It was admittedly risky tampering with such an established character, but lo and behold, the masters at Ninja Theory have pulled it off beautifully. Having even more style and panache than his predecessor, this reborn protagonist has a streak to him the old one simply did not: he's quite likable. While I thought the original Dante was just as pretty and flashy as the next guy, even diehard fans of the original games admit that he's a bit of a tool, and an unabashed dork. While I can understand growing attached to such a character, current gamers might not be as receptive to him. This isn't true with the new version, who is just the right amount of cocky and levelheaded to be instantly liked. Full of witty one-liners, unconventional approaches to troubling situations, yet with enough pathos to be easily sympathized with, the new Dante is a winner.The second thing that makes the narrative so engrossing is how bold it is. Ninja Theory is known for unconventional storytelling choices (Nariko's fate in ""Heavenly Sword"", the live-action ending of ""Enslaved""), but this time, they've gone out of their way to send a scathing message to Americans. They start by making the world's economy rigged to satiate the whims of demons, making the little guys suffer. But they placate society by spiking the world's most popular drink with a ""secret formula"" (sound familiar?), which is actually a psychotropic to keep them fat and dumb. These fat and dumb people get their news from a corrupt news organization, spearheaded by a man with a receding hairline who looks almost identical to Bill O'Reilly.""DmC"" is a vicious assault on American economics, news and consumer culture, and it's absolutely beautiful because of it. I would hazard to say this game may become unpopular because of how blatantly and gloriously offensive it is, and how many sponsors it probably alienated due to its outwardly political stance. Kudos to the writers for not backing down from their gutsy artistic vision.Not to say this game skimps on content when it gets down to hacking and slashing. The developers have taken their experience from past games and mashed it together with the classic, combo-driven gameplay people have come to expect from the franchise. It's a beautiful mixture, much like virtually anything from Starbucks, and with new enemies constantly introduced, players are forced to keep on their toes and not mindlessly button-mash to win. This never feels unfair, however, due to the routine upgrades you'll be doing to Dante, who has loads of unlockable moves and combos for his varied and satisfying arsenal. Combat is fast, furious, and full of depth, so whether you like laying the smack-down on hordes of enemies, or tweaking characters to your play style (all upgrades can be undone and swapped at anytime), you'll find something to love here.What should definitely be pointed out about this entry, in comparison to the older ones, is that the platforming is finally something worth calling home about. That's actually an understatement, because the simple act of jumping on stuff in ""DmC"" is something special, something fun, something fresh. Dante has a double-jump, a mid-air boost, a chain that pulls him into things, and a chain that pulls things into him. Keep in mind that the environments are always changing with every step, so when you're not staying alert during battles, you're on pins and needles trying to stay on solid ground. Heck, sometimes they even mix the two. On the gameplay front, much like the story front, ""DmC"" is positively flawless.Now, it's obvious that this is something Capcom threw a lot of money behind, because this game is a feast for the eyes. The world of ""DmC"" is full of imagination, with pavement that rips out of the ground and spirals into the ground, buildings that warp and compress in attempts to kill Dante, and a strange alternate dimension suspended in the sky. The set pieces are all gorgeous, running the gamut of different settings, from a demented carnival to a soda factory from hell. Especially worth noting is how much effort went into crafting a set of unique and varied enemies, which has always been a defining trait of the series. I'd hazard to say this is the most original and best-looking bestiary in a ""Devil May Cry"" game so far, in fact.  Art direction is more beautiful than anything we've ever seen in the franchise, and it's wonderful to see such imagination replacing the somewhat drab settings of previous entries.It's even better that the art direction pops from the gorgeous graphics. This is one of the best uses of the Unreal engine on the market, period. Animation is fluid, and every inch of the world is beautiful to look at... well, as beautiful as a city that's alive and trying to knock off the protagonist can be, anyway. Wherever you look, Ninja Theory's city of Limbo is gorgeous, as are its inhabitants. Once again, the developer has achieved perfection in this area.Making this the complete package is the killer soundtrack, done by Noisia and Combichrist. Taking a cue from ""Max Payne 3"", whose entire soundtrack was done by rock band Health, ""DmC"" has an entire score composed by these two talented groups, who come together and make a ode to gorgeous musical overkill. Noisia is an electronica trio, and Combichrist is a metal group, so you can pretty much guess the kind of music you'll get here. Loud, fast and pounding synthesizers pump hand-in-hand with wailing guitars and screaming male vocals for a good portion of the game, and surprisingly, this works.The main reason this type of music doesn't annoy here is that it really fits the entire mood of the game, which is one of decadence and flash. Even the brief dives into dubstep territory are enjoyable, and both groups know when to keep the music low-key for more emotional and serious moments. This soundtrack is triumphant, and a perfect match for the atmosphere.Finishing out the strong post-production elements is the voice acting, which is done by a relatively unknown cast who manage to pull it off perfectly. The biggest joy here is definitely Tim Phillipps as Dante, who brings a charming rogue streak to the character, balancing cocky, funny and angry at regular intervals. Here's hoping he stays on board for future entries. Another highlight is David de Lautour as the new and improved Vergil, who has a very ""Occupy Wall Street"" air about him. Other characters, such as graffiti-tagging witch Kat, and a truly ominous main villain make this the complete audio and visual experience.That isn't to say that there aren't a few niggling flaws holding ""DmC"" back from complete, sublime perfection, however. The biggest one would have to be the contrived and bothersome bonus stages. Sure, you don't have to do them, but if you opt to, prepare for some cut-and-paste racing and combat sequences. And if you don't do them, your overall level score gets brought down, which is relatively annoying. Another small gripe is the amount of time it takes to load levels; it's not painful, but it takes longer than it feels like it should. But because the game is gorgeous, and has a lot going in each sprawling level, it's forgivable.These are two tiny little chips in what is otherwise a glorious suit of armor, however. Perfectly balancing plot, gameplay, graphics and music, and mixing in excellent voice acting and brilliant social commentary, Ninja Theory's take on the ""Devil May Cry"" may very well be the best entry in the series since its inception. Devilishly brilliant and fun, ""DmC: Devil May Cry"" is already a prime candidate for Game of the Year.But hey, maybe you shouldn't get it. After all, he doesn't have white hair...Plot: 10Gameplay: 9Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 9.75","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWU3UQR9UZDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UM59AC#wasThisHelpful","RAWU3UQR9UZDO","A3DBUN9EMFMUV1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DBUN9EMFMUV1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Exquisitely beautiful story of a family. Of jealousy within a family, of a father's jealousy over his wife,'s love for the children, the mother's jealousy over her best-loved child, the male member's jealousy over the females and vice versa, the mother's jealousy of the women who come to love her son's but biggest of all is the jealousy between twin boys for the love of the same girl. Parents grow older and die and sons grow older and become fathers. But the twins father one son between them never knowing which is the one true father. It's a tangled sordid affair, a woman who loved dearly but only receives rape in return. The child lives in the house as a son of the house but is never rightfully claimed, but perhaps the family ends with this boy who puts the passion, jealousy, adventure and love into something more positive now that it has destroyed all but him. A literary family drama told with such intensity you can feel the heat rising from the pages; I always love the art from this team and the b/w splashes across the pages with emotion. I would love to read the novel this graphic was adapted from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LY6J4BYLB41X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616558563#wasThisHelpful","R1LY6J4BYLB41X","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cleo returns in another excellent adventure. This series is a science-fiction Indiana Jones with a female protagonist full of derring-do and realistic characters. I love all four main characters, two female/two male and am even intrigued by the new thief introduced in this volume. He's mysterious and though presented, obviously, as the antagonist I can't help but wonder if more will be revealed about him in another volume. Wonderful art, vibrant and full of motion with a wide variety of panel styles used. This volume has a build-up plot which takes the story from the first book and builds upon it, raising the action and continuing the plot to a crescendo, leaving us with a cliffhanger anxiously awaiting book three. I'm loving this series and look forward to the next volume which will be out Spring 2016.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBA2I48YW1KNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545528453#wasThisHelpful","RBA2I48YW1KNK","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Really disappointed in this. Very dull for a superhero that has both Batman and Superman connections. Takes place entirely in Italy and has no supervillains, just a plain international intrigue story and no connections to the DC universe whatsoever.

"A mixed bag of stories, this is the author's first collection. A few of the stories have been previously published with the rest appearing here for the first time. Most of the stories are of the horror variety, but there is a bit of everything added to the mix including straight fiction, children's stories, and mysteries. I found the author quite promising though he has some trouble with perfecting the twist ending. His horror is good, but surprisingly I found his juvenile fiction offerings showed his best overall work. His forays into other genres often left me underwhelmed, but I'm glad to have read the collection.1. Voices in the Field - An elderly man's car breaks down on the side of a highway surrounded by cornfields. He records his thoughts as he waits unsuccessfully for a car to pass by. A chilling story as either the man is a victim to Evil or he descends into madness. The ending needed just an extra something to give it more pow, but this first story certainly makes me look forward to reading more.(3/5)2. Mom's Eye View (2000) - This is a creepy story of a demented guy I guess you'd call a stalker who's got a major Norman Bates vibe going on. The story gets weirder and creepier as it goes along bringing in twists you never quite suspect. Told from alternating points of view, first the stalker dude, then the girl. The ending works up to a great climax but again is a bit of a let down as I felt it just needed that final piece to be polished. (4/5)3. One Night in New Orleans - Very short story of a black woman who has never left her native Minnesota before but who goes on a business trip to New Orleans and spends one night of magic under the influence of the spirit world and music which gives her a new ""soul"" she'll never want to forget. I haven't looked to see who this author is, but the story felt like it was written by a white man. Didn't feel real. (1/5)4. Liquid - The best story so far. A rich, playboy doctor who cares more for his Armani suits and golf than he does his patients is harassed by a toothless, diseased bum for change. When the Dr. refuses rudely to deal with hm, the bum spits on him and the Dr.'s life forever changes. A moral of ""do unto others"" and if you don't you'll have to learn your lesson the hard way ... the *very* hard way. (4/5)5. Homemade Pie - This is a creepy horror story with a good twist ending. A southern teenage girl wants out of the family restaurant business where her mom's pies are such a big business because of the ""special ingredient"". There's a bit of trouble with the ending again though. There was a perfect point for it to have ended, but then the author added some extra lines which weakened it for me. (4/5)6. Rain - Very short. A serial killer's multi-million dollar house complete with thousands of tapes is sliding into oblivion during a mudslide in California. A twist ending you can see coming before it even starts. (2/5)7. Cowboy Up - A cowboy asks a woman to marry him. This is just plain humour so unlike the other stories here. I didn't find it funny. (1/5)8. Truck Stop Love (2000) - This was well-written and had so many possibilities running through my mind, but none of them panned out. The ending was a real let down. A woman stuck working at a truck stop for the last twenty years has given up on her dreams of ever getting out of the tiny little town when she meets the new waitress, someone who reminds her of herself when she was young. I don't know whether to give it a 3 for the writing or a 2 for not going anywhere. I don't usually do halfsies but in this case ... (2.5/5)9. Sorry, wrong number (2001) - Not the best story here but the best written. The tension mounts throughout to an almost perfect twist ending. Written as a series of voice messages between a stalker girl and a couple of guys. (4/5)10. Watching - Very short. Less than a minute. I *think* this is just an example that we don't need to think anymore since we have search engines. I had to read it twice to get it, so I'll give it two stars. (2/5)11. Toby and the Lake - This was written well and the ending was very good, but I didn't like the story at all. I quickly knew where the story was going. Some people will find it compelling but in the end it's a sympathetic portrayal of someone who is nothing but a murderer. (2/5)12. End Game - Loved this one! A dark, gloomy tale of a man writing his murder/suicide letter. He's a despicable creature and we are sure we know what is going on, but the twist ending proves we don't and just how vile the man really is. (5/5)13. A Fire Inside (2001) - Another good one that would fit in the crime or mystery genre. A woman is positive her mother's death was not accidental six years ago and has been calling the police continuously ever since to reopen the case and look closer at murder. For a joke, her call is transferred to ""the new guy"" and what he uncovers is far more than the daughter could have ever expected or perhaps ever wanted to know. (5/5)14. The Pumpkin Princess - This is a sweet little story told from the pumpkin's point of view. Obviously written for young children and strange to find in this collection here at this point. Very well-written, has a bit of tension, a perfect Halloween story for little ones. (5/5)15. Least Likely to Succeed: A Vinita Park Short Mystery for Young Readers (2001) - Good story. An unpopular but brainy kid who often solves mysteries is asked by the most popular girl at school to find out who stole her iPod from her locker. Fine, well-written mystery with an unsuspected ending. More than a mystery story it deals a lot with bullying and includes realistic teen dialogue. We have the viciousness between girls and a mean ""fat"" kid bully. These last two juvenile stories make me wonder if perhaps this is where the author's forte may lie. (5/5)16. All-American Murder (2001) - A standard murder mystery involving college football players. Nothing special but not bad. (3/5)17. Weight - The final story comes full circle with another horror offering. A high school student tells of the bullying he's received his whole life because he's fat from other kids, teachers, and his own parents. He's now planning his final revenge. Pretty freaky and a good note to end the book on.

"I love this series! This volume brings back the excitement of the ""War"" part of the title and a lot of the plot centres around the author they have been protecting. I like that as it's one of the reasons I got into the series in the first place. Dojo and Kasahara don't get any closer in this volume frustratingly enough. Kasahara spends her time agonizing over what he will say when she comes right out and tells him she likes him. So no kiss, but there is an amazing scene where she punches him in the face! LOL!

"Outstanding nonfiction graphic retelling of WWII's Omaha Beach through the eye's of photojournalist Robert Capra. This is both Capra's story and an accounting of the D-Day battle. Through graphic art panels, photography, and essays the reader is taken right into the middle of this famous event which molds itself around Capra's famous photograph ""Soldier in the Surf"". The majority of the book is told in graphic novel format and tells Robert Capra's story of being a photojournalist during WWII, especially his involvement in Omaha Beach and the famous photographs he took that day. Following that are the photographs themselves, entitled ""The Magnificent Eleven"" as a group and, in conclusion, there are three essays illustrated with photos by Capra, of Capra, and by others which give a deeper insight into both Robert Capra, the man and Capra the photojournalist as well as the story behind the iconic photograph, ""Soldier in the Surf"".

"The last chapter had me choking back the tears. I read this book probably in about Grade 5 and from there went on to read all Peck's books. This is my first re-read and I can see why it affected me so much at the time and I also see that it began a long-lasting relationship for me with this type of literature. I'm still drawn, today, to books about farm people, mountain people, uneducated folks, living off the land, living plain and simple. And books that end with sadness and people dying, books that some would call depressing but rather I see the redemption that will follow after the book has been closed.This is Peck's first book and is autobiographical; he even uses his and his father's own names for the characters. Set in 1920s Vermont it opens with a violent, brutal first chapter involving a cow birthing gone wrong and the main character being injured. The rest of the book follows suit. This book is very real where the animals are concerned and gets banned or censored regularly by animal rights activists making it a good choice for Banned Books Week. I just love the rawness of this story, the love of this simple family living off the land, the Shaker ways they try to uphold and the plainness of the language. It makes me want to re-read all Peck's books again from the 70s and 80s and read all the new ones I haven't read. I see a sequel was written in the 90s. One certainly isn't needed, but it will make for an interesting read to find how Robert's next year on the farm fares. This is a keeper for my shelves, but I'll have to scout out for the hardcover edition I remember from my 70s childhood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYXWQ24GQOVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679853065#wasThisHelpful","R1GYXWQ24GQOVI","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The new set of chapter books from Capstone have in-depth stories and I'm very pleased with these. Bruce is in Brazil for an economic environment conference and who should be there causing trouble but Poison Ivy. Plus she's got Man-Bat under her control as well! There's more story than action, but these three characters take centre stage throughout the whole book so there are plenty of costumed capers. I liked the environmental story for the most part as its message was not extremist but rather showed how Poison Ivy herself took her beliefs beyond radical preferring to erase humans to protect the plants. Bruce Wayne's end solution was more politically correct than economically sound but otherwise an entirely enjoyable escapade. Poison Ivy is one of my favourite villains!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDYMVOBYAEDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496505158#wasThisHelpful","RGDYMVOBYAEDH","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lots of action but we're really getting to know Rokuro and Benio better as characters and they are getting to know each other better. Also included here is some good plotting with the story behind the ""twin star"" exorcists and family history for Benio.

I do kind of wish he'd ended a little sooner than he did though. I liked the snow, but the follow up afterwards didn't do it for me.

"Brett Battles writes adult thrillers and even though I haven't read him before I have to admit when I picked up this middle-grade reader I thought it was going to be a mystery adventure. Instead, I was pleasantly charmed with this tale of pure delightful fantasy which had me hooked from the first chapter. A well-written fun story I quickly found myself attached to the characters and intrigued with the plot. It's fast-paced, humorous and unique. I was hardly half-way through the book when I was looking online for book 2, to unfortunately find there isn't a sequel. Obviously one was intended as even though the book has a definite ending, it is the perfect set-up for a series. I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures of the Trouble family, but it's a bit of a let down to not have another book to follow it up.

"Fuzz McFlops is a famous poet. He's a recluse, a loner, has a deformed ear, an anxiety condition and never reads his fan mail. Until one day, an especially vibrant letter catches his eye and he opens it. The female writer doesn't like the depressing ending of a poem of his and suggests a happy ending for it. He throws it in the garbage. She continues to write him and they become friends with her letters influencing a bit. Enough to make a difference but too much to change who he is, in fact, she likes who he is. This is a beautiful story, a love story, of accepting who you are, being yourself and there is a true love possible for everyone. But one must step outside their comfort zone just a little bit to meet that person; you can't accomplish anything by doing nothing at all. Really such a sweet story!Secondly, the book uses many different types of literature: fables, letters, fairytales, music, poetry, recipes, postcards, post scripts, etc. At the back of the book is a glossary of sorts listing every device used and explaining what it is and its purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ODPOLT6QTSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782690751#wasThisHelpful","R9ODPOLT6QTSL","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a continuation of the story as she concludes the search for the killer of her mother and continues training to be her father's sidekick and one day replace him.  A rip-roaring adventure with lots of action, humour and fabulous art.  Great characters return from the first book.

"Brilliant! Fascinating and inspiring! Allan Say presents in a long picture book format his memoir of the first three years he spent in America those being his high school years where he studied art. Left to fend for himself by a neglectful father 15-year-old Say lives on his own, works part-time and his talent is eventually ""discovered"" by a teacher or two leading to special opportunities and scholarships. The book ends with his graduation. It's also an interesting look at 1950s California, life for a Japanese youth in America just after the war, and about perseverance to make your dreams come true. Gorgeously illustrated throughout in various styles to reflect the content of the story, this is a book that will hold the interest of readers of all ages, especially other artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AKHOO3Q9OZC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545437768#wasThisHelpful","R1AKHOO3Q9OZC9","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Astounding! I had no idea this was the book it turned out to be.  Expecting a juvenile history of the Motown years I was floored with the in-depth narrative of the history of not only Motown music but the whole Motown scene, a biography of Barry Goldie himself and even more interesting a discourse of US African-American history from the 50s to 80s through the voice of their music.  An extremely interesting book with tons of history I knew nothing about. I knew all the songs, but everything else was eye-opening to me.  Narrated in a most unusual and unique style by an entity called ""The Groove"", claiming to be neither male nor female, The Groove simply exists.  However, I quickly related to the narrator by thinking of ""her"" as an elderly black Grandma, speaking in the vernacular of the day and consistently calling the reader ""Child"".  The Afterward related who the author styled ""The Groove"" after and my own perception couldn't have been further from the author's intent!This book deals with every possible subject you could imagine about the times, the stars and the music but it does take two hard-hitting historical detours which are necessary when telling the African-American story from any point of view, even through its music.  These are Southern segregation and the Race Riots of the early 70s, both of these are part of the Civil Rights Movement.  These sections are dealt with in a particularly sensitive yet no punches held manner for the middle-grade audience.  To paraphrase ""The Groove"", the general atmosphere used to introduce these topics is: 'Now, Child, we are coming to some dark, disturbing times.  I'm sorry.  I don't like this part of our history, but it happened and is an important part of the Groove.  Close your eyes if you must, but make sure you listen as this story must be told and not forgotten.  You are safe and I am with you.""  Doesn't that sound like your Grandma telling you stories about her past?!  Totally 100% loved the book.  The back matter is incredible as well with a Discography, recommended TV/Movie watching, Bibliography plus Recommended Reading List.  A must read on the topic for young and old!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVB4YLKVVL58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596439734#wasThisHelpful","R2FVB4YLKVVL58","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love, love, love - Such a joy reading a new volume about Takeo and Yamato. This volume is a little more laid back, no pivotal moment for the couple. Instead, the book focuses on Valentine's Day and Takeo's mother finally has the baby. In Japan the tradition is that on Feb. 14 girls give chocolate to guys that they like, then on March 14 is White Day in which boys give chocolate back to every girl who gave them chocolate. This year Takeo is sooooo excited that he will be getting his first ever ""true love"" chocolate now that he has a girlfriend instead of sympathy chocolate like the one he has received from an elderly neighbour since he was a little boy. A great sweet episode with some funny and poignant moments. I love Takeo's mother; she's one tough cookie! Finally, a few moments near the end leave us with a surprise ending that Sunakawa has had a secret admirer for quite some time who actually intrigues him and Takeo may have just found out their identity! Highly recommend this series to shoujo fans who love simple, sweet slice-of-life stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25IDJ483EYTXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421579146#wasThisHelpful","R25IDJ483EYTXF","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't too sure about this.  The premise sounded interesting but, it's always hit and miss for me with shoujo because I don't like romance.  But I adored QQ Sweeper!!  It's got something for everyone and Fumi is a fantastic female character.  She's bold and brazen in her pursuit for a Prince Charming. She wants a handsome rich man and has no shame in saying so.  She has the good-hearted, kind nature of any Disney princess.  On the other hand she kicks ass, boldly goes where ever the heck she wants, bows out gently if she finds her chosen Prince Charming just isn't into her and tells it like it is: speaking the obvious truth while apologizing when necessary.  Love her!  This story has romance, psychology, the paranormal by way of dreams, nightmare insects, a secret mystery, cliffhanger ending and, cleverly placed within the plot handy-dandy cleaning tips!  Totally awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGQVLOFHNIWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421582147#wasThisHelpful","R2QGQVLOFHNIWS","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to give up on this a few times but made it through to the end. It's just a bunch of short episodes giving Mr. Terrific a new reboot. The last one was the best but it was cancelled and the book leaves us with his fate unknown. I'd never heard of Terrific before and I think that's a horrible superhero name. He's really arrogant and only believes in science making it difficult for him to have relationships since he has no faith in anyone. It's all pretty lacklustre no good villains but the last story has a hybrid computer/man whose ok and the Blackhawks show up briefly to arrest Mr. Terrible because he's a vigilante and we're given some backstory between them. Cliffhanger ending, though I think he comes back on one of the Justice League teams.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI3NXAILC80L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140123500X#wasThisHelpful","R3FI3NXAILC80L","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The art is the best thing about this profusely illustrated picture book for older kids. It's creepy and haunting, a bit scary and gross at times, certainly disturbing and the creatures are the stuff of nightmares. I liked it, the colours, dark and cool, purples and blues matched the gothic atmosphere. The story, on the other hand is somewhat long-winded taking ages to get to any point. The whole first half up to where Jonathan can't come up with a story, I found boring and tedious and struggled with not wanting to finish the book. It would hardly have changed the plot had the book started in the middle with Jonathan sitting there without a story to tell, getting up, and the same events would have followed. This is where it picked up for me and I started to enjoy the swamp creatures and the antics. There is a moral; Jonathan starts off as a timid person afraid of living and after his adventure he has gained self-confidence and a new joy for life. Great art, so-so story","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVM2DTH4AZYG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449471005#wasThisHelpful","RVM2DTH4AZYG4","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the last book translated into English and ends mid-battle! In the first part mamodo Ted is reunited with his beloved who happens to have been taken over by the evil side. Our gang gets closer to the brain during this part and we lose both a good and bad guy, kind of sad here. Then the rest of the book has them reaching the anti-chamber next to the brain with lots of action getting there. Many mamodo come back on the scene from where they've been waiting, there's some great humour and an epic return and loss. The final boss protecting the brain room is being fought when the book ends. Also, Kiyo has been out of action the last few volumes leaving Zatch unable to battle, so we've seen him take on a leadership role that has really matured his character.There are 8 more volumes left in the series and since they aren't available in English I will (for the first time ever!) be resorting to scanlations to finish off the series.

"This isn't too bad really, but it had more potential than it gave. It's an action/adventure high-tech military operation kind of like A-Team, but more character driven and sci-fi like Stargate while the enemy they meet is a hive-collective like the Borg. So that's all really cool, but sadly there is no character development, almost all the characters are created from scratch for this series and there are no back stories for anyone. Boo! Lady Blackhawk, of course, is a mainstream DC character, but I don't know her. I liked everyone else but wanted to know them. There are 8 issues gathered here, that was plenty of space to include a backstory of some sort for everyone. At least they were given notice of cancellation as the book ends on a final note and there are character threads floating around so it's possible somebody could show up again. Not terrible, not connected to the DC Universe in any way, and certainly not required reading, but not a waste of time.

"An engrossing read from start to finish. The book narrows down its focus quite quickly but does start broadly to illustrate how the author arrives at his premise. Starting with worldwide execution methods throughout history, Galvin quickly travels through medieval and renaissance Europe, then particularly Britain from whence the colonists brought their preferred execution styles with them to the new world. For most of Britain and it's colonies, hanging became the civilized method and was used almost exclusively in the US until a time when Britain was perfecting the method. What was the US to do? Follow Britain again? Was hanging the most humane method of execution? The French had the guillotine, the Spanish the garrotte, and the firing squad has been used in most civilized countries even up to today. But the US went a very American direction and invented a uniquely American device that is associated with the US only, the electric chair. This book then tells the making of, history of, use of, moratorium on, reinstatement of, replacement of by more modern technology, and the possibilities of its comeback. Quite fascinating stuff whether reading about Edison and Westinghouse's quarrels about A/C vs D/C electrical currents, reading about botched executions, prisoner's last meals, or case studies of numerous individuals who ended up in the electric chair.One thing this book is not, is an argument pro or con death penalty. For the largest part the author presents an entirely unbiased introduction of the facts; he uses a slight bit of gallows humour which is expected in these types of writings. Personally, I am against any form of capital punishment for any reason and yet I found Galvin's writing style informative and entertaining. The last few chapters Galvin does seem to press heavy that the current state of affairs does need change/reform and here he loses his bias as he does lean more one way than the other, but his information is interesting, even if one tempers his statistics as over keen especially as he heavily pushes the innocent quotient. But these are realistic thoughts to be thinking of going forward: 1: the EU's refusal to sell lethal injection drugs to the US; supplies are currently already low; 2) the research data that concludes lethal injection has probably been one of the most painful methods of execution the US has ever used, hanging was more efficient, beheading is most humane; and 3) 1 in 25 death row inmates is innocent of the crime for which they have been sentenced to death. None of these factors affect any change in my own opinions as they are based on my faith which cannot be swayed. Tha majority of the book though is about the past, that which happened, without any judgement and is an exciting book to read. I read the first whole half in one evening!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3YA3S86KBTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631440268#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3YA3S86KBTS","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The men are gone and Marianne takes off with Adrian across the Rift which is hidden in a heavy fog. On the other side, they arrive in Nillpolis, a place that reminds me of the Mad Max world, where the search (or ""chase"" of the title) goes on both for the missing Richard and from the nefarious authorities of this cruel barbarian land. This is a fast-paced volume that is entirely action-packed as they meet adversity every step of the way. Many new characters are introduced, but this seems to be an episodic adventure along the way so these characters may not return. There is an awesome battle scene at a trial as the lawyers physically fight each other! One of them looks just like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith, except about 8ft tall! This volume though brings the series to a more mature level than the previous two as both rape and prostitution are themes as well as strong language usage including the f-word. So don't be fooled by the cute cover illustration. I'm really enjoying this French manga-style series and look forward to book 4.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJKPZPNGMJYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626720487#wasThisHelpful","RTJKPZPNGMJYF","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Graphic novels have successfully taught and brought to life history but not so much for other educational topics. Science has been done before and I've found it hit or miss. Human Body Theater manages to present an in-depth look at human biology while providing entertainment. A skeleton is the M.C. for a ""play"" which discusses all the human body systems and parts. The material covered is quite extensive and the book's main objective is to impart knowledge. While doing so cute cartoon figures have been used, adding arms, legs, and eyes to cells and organs, etc. The tone is one of levity and there is a sense of humour throughout. It's a lot of fun. I'll address the topics of puberty and reproduction in particular. As a Christian, I thought the puberty section was well-done. It is candid and thorough, but all illustrations are of the inside workings, so no nudity and the topics discussed remain factual not venturing into any territory some would consider moral issues. The reproductive system was handled well also and written in a way trying not to offend anyone. I found it to be on the PC side but acceptable. Again, no nudity and this is about the system not about sex at all. The PC part that tries to please all concerns the development of the unborn. The word ""baby"" is not used until the 9th month, the unborn child is referred to as a ""fetus"" throughout except for the zygote stage at which it is referred to as a ""clump of cells"". Altogether a well thought-out primer on the human body with extensive information, entertaining, and a light tone. Suitable for any age mature enough for the depth of knowledge imparted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMB4DDJA5DESM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596439297#wasThisHelpful","RMB4DDJA5DESM","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A decent rendition of the classic Frankenstein story with beautiful illustrations every spread. The illustrations make this book as they are simply lovely even though they depict the creature akin to Boris Karloff's version which is not how he appears in the novel at all. The text does a good job of simplifying the story while keeping all the major plot points including important but small details such as the murder of the little brother and keeping in mind the whole deprivation of love/revenge-theme. Two points which make this version miss the mark are that the creature is identified as a ""monster"" immediately and it fails to convey Victor Frankenstein's insanity. These are key to understanding the original novel but still this version does introduce the story to first-time young readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0YRMQOF8CW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609927354#wasThisHelpful","RY0YRMQOF8CW7","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very well written story in itself and a well-told adaptation of the classic tale. Many adaptations choose to concentrate on the headless horseman and turn this into a horror story when it is not. This author has kept to the original by presenting a fine folktale of life in New York, a love triangle, and the place ghost stories held in these peoples' lives. The headless horseman scene is the climax of the story which meanders along telling the story of Ichabod Crane first and foremost with moments of humour and a bit of a sense of the haunted.

"The first and longest story in this book is a new origin story for KITT which is all action/adventure, spies, secret organizations, and scientists. I liked this the best. It's not like the original show much, but the car goes through a few upgrades until he's like we're used to by the end. The second story was by different artists, having a different look which I didn't like and the story got all touchy-feely and sentimental between KITT and Michael making it weird and boring.

"Whenever I see Gene Luen Yang has a new book out I get all giddy with excitement. And he has done it again and brought us something completely different and unique. The beginning of a new series ""Secret Coders"" has secrets, strange goings on and creepy staff at a private school that looks more like a haunted house. What makes this book so fun and novel is its interaction with the reader. Software coding is the topic of the day and Yang weaves this through the first volume by having the characters learn through puzzles and logic reasoning. Before the characters are told the answers to the puzzles and riddles they (and the reader) are asked to solve it themselves. (This is within the narrative of the story; it's not a puzzle book that you write in or anything of that sort). This first book in the series teaches binary code then moves on to the concept of coding being a set of commands. It's truly engaging and the plot involves strange birds with 4 eyes, a robotic turtle, a mysterious blue-skinned man, an evil janitor and the main character's father suddenly abandoning his family. The book ends with an unsolved puzzle leaving the reader waiting for the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKT2BALWA9RWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626720754#wasThisHelpful","RKT2BALWA9RWL","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just adorable! Macbeth was my favourite but this comes pretty close. That's probably my own bias though since I love Macbeth and don't like Romeo and Juliet. However, Lender changes everything about R&J that bothers me turning it into a cute little romp of a tragedy. Romeo is a rooster and Juliet is a bear and instead of being in love they become BFF's! They don't commit suicide but go into hibernation and the theme is prejudice: petting zoo animals vs forest animals. The book is a joy to read; Lender has such a crazy sense of humour and Giallongo's art is comical. Regular characters return from the last book and mention of last week's play, Macbeth, is made. The monkey family returns and the audience antics are probably my favourite part. I'd hardly call these a real introduction to Shakespeare as the plots have been changed so much rather it's just a jumping off point for Lender to make a riotous pastiche of classic literature. The ending tells us that the next book will be a comedy, I wonder what it will be??

"A varied selection of ghost stories from Victorian era through to modern day authors. The spooky ghost theme is consistent throughout the collection though sometimes the reader is left with deciding whether it is a story of the paranormal or madness. The writing, however, varies widely from Gothic to humour to horror to simply odd and so on making it a decidedly inconsistent anthology. Overall, I found the selections mediocre, some better than others, a few great, but more than a few less than good. There were some I'd read before and the older ones were my favourites. There were classic stories by Poe, Oliver Onions and M.R. James but surprisingly my favourite in the entire collection was a modern story by a new-to-me author, Kelly Link. Almost all the older authors I've read before, if not these specific tales, but I just wasn't wowed by their representative stories. They have so many much better titles to choose from. Certainly not one of my favourite anthologies, but if you haven't read any of these authors before they are worth reading.1. The Black Cat by Edgar Allan Poe (1843) - I've read this many times and reviewed it before. Quintessential Poe with many of his oft-repeated themes. The cat episode never fails to get at me. A little iffy as to whether it is a ghost story, though. (5/5)2. Secret Life with Cats by Audrey Niffenegger (2006) - Ok this is certainly freaky. Freaky in a weird way and puts an entirely new spin on the idea of the crazy cat lady. Fun to read but the ending didn't seem to fit the character. (3/5)3. Pomegranate Seed by Edith Wharton (1931) - Gahhh! This was decidedly dull with an incredibly predictable melodramatic ending. (2/5)4. The Beckoning Fair One by Oliver Onions (1911) - The collection's novella, this is a very long story. I haven't come across this author before but I'll be sure to look out for his name from now on. Very satisfying story that has us thinking all over the place. Either a ghost story or a descent into madness with a completely shocking ending that took me by surprise. The ending really makes the story worth the read. (5/5)5. The Mezzotint by M.R. James (1904) - Oooh! Spooky! I loved this and the writing. James is a wonderful writer from this period. A man receives a picture and every time he looks at it, it has changed. Very creepy when he finds out the history of the engraving. (5/5)6. Honeysuckle Cottage by P.G. Wodehouse (1925) - The intro to this story says it's funny but I'm not a huge fan of Wodehouse and found the story a bit insipid and silly rather than ha-ha funny. A dyed-in-the-wool bachelor writer of mysteries inherits his romance writer aunt's house and finds it haunted by the spirit of wholesome head-over-heels love stories. Readable enough to keep my attention, though. (3/5)7. Click-Clack the Rattlebag by Neil Gaiman (2013) - Fast forward to modern times and here is a very short creepy story from Gaiman. It's certainly creepy enough but the pov it's written from isn't possible if we're to believe the intended doomed ending. I'm not big on Gaiman. (3/5)8. They by Rudyard Kipling (1904) - A man drives upon a secluded manor with a large garden of fanciful topiaries and spies assorted children. Then he meets the young, beautiful blind mistress of the estate. Quite haunting though overly sentimental. (3/5)9. Playmates by A.M. Burrage (1927) - Well-written though fairly straightforward 'nice' ghost story. A lonely young girl is raised alone by her elderly guardian, they move to an inherited old house and her usual glum manner eventually brightens up. Her guardian and the housekeeper think she has made up some imaginary friends but we, the reader, can figure out what these so-called friends really are. (3/5)10. The July Ghost by A.S. Byatt (1982) - A man rents upper rooms from a married woman and soon learns he is the only one being visited by her 11yo son who was killed in a traffic accident two years ago. This was just boring. (1/5)11. Laura by Saki aka H.H. Munroe (1914) - Saki is hit and miss with me; usually a miss and this was one of those. A woman is on her death bed talking about how she supposes she will be reincarnated as an otter. Of course, she does. The humour falls flat on me and I just found it stupid. (1/5)12. The Open Window by Saki aka H.H. Munro (1914) - Now this one is a hit. I've read it before, but it always delights. A teenage girl plays a nasty trick on a distraught visiting man. Dark humour. (5/5)13. The Specialist's Hat by Kelly Link (1998) - This is a new-to-me author and I found this a spooky ghost story. It is a babysitter story and I admit to enjoying creepy babysitter tales. This one runs counter to your usual bb-sitter horror, and because of that is indeed a unique twist and haunting tale that slowly reveals it's rather unexpected ending. Probably my favourite in the entire collection. (5/5)14. Tiny Ghosts by Amy Giacalone (2015; previously unpublished) - This is just silly, but I guess the moral is not to let anyone push you around. (2/5)15. The Pink House by Rebecca Curtis (2014) - A woman tells a gathering of writers and painters an obscure true ghost story which happened to her over a period of seven years. At the end, the listeners tell her what they think of her tale, which isn't much at all and I felt the same way. Strange, but in a ""why bother"" way. (2/5)16. August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains by Ray Bradbury (1950, orig. ""April 1985"") - A haunting, tale that tells the last day in the life of an automated house that survived the nuclear apocalypse. Chilling. It is dated, though, and changing the stories time-frame date from 1985 to 2026 doesn't fix that. I can take the piece more seriously as intended, from a Cold War perspective. I'd give the original 5 stars but give the edited date version four.

"It has been almost a whole year since the last volume of Vinland Saga came out and it was with great anticipation that I started reading this next one. I was not disappointed. When we left Thorfinn in Vol. 5 his life had changed drastically and new horizons were in front of him, this is where our story now picks up. The first half of the book is devoted to politics, war and King Canute as he works on his army in Denmark to hold onto his newly gained lands in England. The scenes switch between here and Thorfinn and fellow slave Einar back at their master's farm. Great events are happening which will bring the war home to them. The second half of the book concentrates on Thorfinn, the slave, and his new coda of peace that he must live up. He isn't a Christian (yet?) but he listens to Bible readings and his self-induced code of conduct could easily be compared to the teachings of Jesus. He wants to end war and slavery while atoning for his past transgressions. The most powerful image in the entire book is a scene with Thorfinn carrying the corpses of all the people he has slain upon his back, saying he can carry this load but could not handle even one more soul. Leif Erickson is back on the scene briefly and Thorfinn remembers a childhood conversation of a land faraway where there is no war or slavery. The story is becoming very inspirational and Thorfinn's strength and determination is being pushed with as much vehemence to his new moral standards of non-violence as it was previously towards his revenge. Don't get me wrong though there is still a lot of brutal savagery in the story, this is war, these are the Vikings, Yukimura is keeping it very real! Amazing manga of epic proportions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCQYQT1HZ5C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612628036#wasThisHelpful","R1CCQYQT1HZ5C2","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a beautiful book! The art is absolutely stunning. Done through some sort of printmaking processes, nevertheless they look like wood prints from any of the masters of old. These have been beautifully painted and Claudia McGehee has brought a striking collection of nature art for readers to behold.  Accompanying the art is a simple story with no real plot but a general narrative of a little girl who just adores her grandma who lives in a cabin in the north woods.  Her narrative is uncomplicated, but filled with joy, as she describes the delights they encounter as the two of them walk through the woods sometimes stopping to sit by the pond, other times to lay on a blanket.

"This is strange, odd, bizarre and all those things you'd probably expect a comic book starring Alice Cooper to be. It was a fun read though not serious by any means. Here, Alice is a paranormal being back to his own domain as the Lord of Nightmares and the book covers two story arcs. The longest one has him up against Clan Black who want to oust him from his role. The second one has Alice fighting against his own nightmare and is my favourite of the two. This is pure fun, a bit campy, the art is ok, and I'd recommend it especially to die-hard Alice Cooper fans (which I'm not) as they'll appreciate it for what it is the most. However, after reading the whole book, it was overshadowed by the inclusion of the entirely kitschy Marvel Premiere Issue #50 which features Cooper's comic book debut as a mental patient!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YLETE8MP04B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606906925#wasThisHelpful","R17YLETE8MP04B","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I totally loved this! A collection of comics previously published as a webcomic depicting both the author's and other people's darkest fears. Some are absolutely hilarious in a dark, unsettling way, but I must admit to laughing out loud more than once. I was amazed how many of these I've actually shared at least once, especially the ones taken from childhood fears. Some are quite gruesome while others are plain silly but all get to the various insecurities we all share as human beings and I could relate to where even the strangest fears were coming from. The book made me want to tell the author my own fears and have him draw them for me! Hope there is a second collection on the works!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1M0MZLZYABY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607748150#wasThisHelpful","R1J1M0MZLZYABY","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An intense deep espionage tale involving two sisters. Virtually wordless this is a complex story that defies time and place to ultimately bring the story of two lonely women who take courage and strength to defy typical role models and end up not necessarily happy but as survivors. The book looks deceptively simple with its sparse use of text but should not be read through quickly as there is a lot of story here and like Kindt's ""Red-Handed"" is one that deserves to be read more than once to fully appreciate. Loved it even though I admit I got confused a few times during my first read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZH1CJ68DPNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616557214#wasThisHelpful","R2RZH1CJ68DPNP","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of action I admit got a bit confusing for me. Poor Dianne is being attacked at the beginning and all are coming to her rescue. But then a weird series of events where Diane is a child. Never quite sure if this was a flashback (no black borders) or a dream (seems to be real, though) this part's weird.  Then the action picks up and makes sense as the focus is back on saving Princess Elizabeth from her kidnappers whose evil plot is now revealed. I'm getting tired of the rescue-Elizabeth arc and would like the seventh sin to be found and join the group as we still only have six.

"I've read all Barclay's books by this point and have to say, unfortunately, this is not his best. The first half was great, with lots going on, a murder, weird things and kept me turning the pages. Then a point came when I had an ""Aha"" moment and came up with a scenario that would explain the major case of the book and the way things worked out I was right. That's ok, I often do figure things out, but there were so many other story arcs going on that I couldn't place how they would fit that I was eager to see how it all came together in the end. Then the book ended!! The next page told me to read the *next* book *next* year for the continuing story. WTF? Barclay doesn't write series! I had no idea this book had no ending and was majorly pissed off. There is a lot going on here and yes, I want to see what happens next so yes, I will be reading the next book. However, the publisher did Barclay's fans a BIG disservice by not putting on the cover something to the effect of ""First in new series by Linwood Barclay"" to give us a head's up that this would not be a stand-alone like every other one of his books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCSJ2XXTV4HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385685203#wasThisHelpful","RFCSJ2XXTV4HR","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this! I've not read Shazam in the comics yet, only run across him a couple times on teams but surely do remember watching the TV Show in the '70s!  What a fun comic for kids! Lots of story, the pages are full of frames, text is smaller than what you usually find in these kid comics. The art is fantastic, not as cartoony as normally seen either, but more sketchy, stylized and obviously recognizable as the illustrator's own. This first issue in the series doesn't have a main supervillain, though it ends with his introduction, instead the book has Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel off saving a few people while we get to know them, see how they became the superheroes and watch them live their lives.

"This series has been done very well indeed! I am not a fan of Jane Austen, but I have read all her books, most as a teenager. Emma, however, is my favourite even if that isn't saying much ;-) I get so irritated by all the characters for most of the book. This manga adaptation really does a good job of turning it into a classic shoujo romance though and gives a splendid account of the famous story of Emma's matchmaking and her obsession with the British class system.

"What I like about this series is that it 's always something a little different, you never know what kind of case you'll have. While at the same time every book places you in familiar territory with beloved characters who wine and dine while amateur detecting. I loved this entry in the series! It was a much darker story than the others, even though no murder was committed, per se. It is a tale of human imperfection, seeking atonement and redemption, with a bittersweet ending. This one actually reminded me of a Father Brown story.

Everything is all a bit mysterious as to why these three teens are being called to fight the demons that seem to be gathering upon Tokyo. The characters are introduced nicely and the demons are absolutely awesome. The art is very well-done and I've got to say I was hooked only several pages in. This isn't just your typical demon-slayer; there's something unique here, a feel and atmosphere with this first volume, the rest we'll have to find out later as so much mystery surrounds the story yet.

"I really enjoyed this adaptation.  I haven't read the original and am not likely to but have read a prior graphic adaptation. While the back notes do say some story arcs have been left out (due to space) it is basically the same plot as what I've read before from a Papercutz adaptation. The religious themes of the original story are forefront, but this adaptation does not concentrate on Hester's deep faith instead keeping the focus more on Chillingworth's evilness. The art even plays with shadows, etc at times making him appear to have horns or a mask. The story plays out very well in manga form.  Little Pearl is the perfect cute wide-eyed girl and the Reverend has been drawn with long hair to play the role of handsome young man.  I've read two books in this series and eagerly read both of them.

"A quick read. I'm Canadian and had never heard of this case so found it interesting. All the facts and information are given in an informative matter, but much of the details are not given in the narrative but instead left to be revealed with the trial, which made confusing reading at times. Legebokoff is a very atypical serial killer though and I found the book wanting in any psychological perspective. A professional profile of Cody would have been much appreciated.

"Absolutely fantastic. An intense, hardcore sci-fi dystopian world that has been invaded by humanity's ""natural enemy"", the Titans. This omnibus edition collects volumes 1-5 and is a massive, oversized tome. A beautiful book to add to your collection and one I'm glad to own. I prefer to read older manga in these omnibus editions as there is nothing like sitting down for an epic mass reading of several volumes at once and this volume delivers on all levels. Published in an oversized edition, the gorgeous, creepy art is maximized, each individual volume features a few full-colour pages. The paper is quality and it has a lay-flat binding. Well worth the money, especially when bought at a discount on-line. This is my first time reading the story, but it's been on my want-to-read for some time now and the availability of the omnibus edition pushed me to get started. It's a must-read for manga enthusiasts; a highly intelligent, futuristic military story. Just don't get attached to any characters as no one is safe from the author's sword; I got quite involved on an emotional level as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DS6YH6QHPO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612629717#wasThisHelpful","R24DS6YH6QHPO2","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mecha is one of my favourite genres, but I don't seem to read it very much.  Not sure if Ultraman is relly mecha as we have some aliens involved rather than robots, but they *look* like robots.  This was a quick rush of a read for me.  Tons of action, with some great art but still plenty of story and character to get us interested and get the plot started.  Quite impressive for a first volume where action/plot often overrides character.  Shinjiro starts out as a toddler then we skip ahead to the present where he is a young man.

"A wonderful, funny, touching coming-of-age story. Thomasina has always been waiting for some kind of magic to happen to her ever since her parents died when she was five years old and now that she's sixteen it has finally happened. But not exactly how she expected. One morning she wakes up to find her snake has turned into a human and her entire family, except grandma, have turned into various pets. This is the beginning of an amazing, magical journey to the realm of magic and the in-between. Thomasina meets wizards, crushes on two very unique guys (neither exactly human), learns to stand up for herself and in a true coming of age story learns to finally say goodbye to the sad memories that she has held onto for so long. A very well-written and touching story. Pat Shand is my favourite author over at Zenescope and I was intrigued to see he'd written something for a Young Adult audience. I really had no idea what to expect with this since it is the very first thing I've read by Shand that is not full of violence and, not shall we say very risque. He's shown here with this outstanding work that he is a talented author whether writing for adults or youth. Bravo! I also must mention before concluding that the artwork is well done. It's compelling and I really enjoyed the look. The concentration on facial expressions and minimalistic backgrounds helps tell the emotional part of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYM6DILEZ7XJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939683645#wasThisHelpful","RYM6DILEZ7XJ1","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I never saw that ending coming! (5/5)The Werewolf of Fever Swamp by Gabriel Hernandez - A good story. I've read the original GB novel version of this so felt something was missing but a good fright tale. (4/5)Ghost Beach by Ted Naifeh - Brilliant. I love this author's work and art and he brings a decidedly creepy story. I knew something had to happen but was still surprised by the ending. I kept wondering what about the parents, though? (5/5)Night if the Living Dummy by Dave Roman - A fun origin story of ""Slappy"" the Living Dummy (who is in several GB novels though I haven't read any). Silly and a little creepy but mostly fun.

"Quite a treat! I've actually never run across Lobo before in my DC readings so wasn't sure where this was going to take me. A bit of an odd beginning for a Vol. 1 as it seems to start with the end of a previous story but when that wraps up it quickly gets on with the story for this trade. Lobo is under contract to kill 8 assassins who are each assigned to kill planet Earth. This is all pretty cool, bloody and violent with each assassin being a unique, though brief, new character. Oh and Superman shows up for an assist as well.  But my favourite parts were the interspersed flashbacks  that took us back to the end days of Lobo's own planet and told his background story. Lobo is quite the villain or is it anti-hero, I'm not sure which, but I'd love to read him again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJG13374DWNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401254837#wasThisHelpful","R2EJG13374DWNM","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovely, warm fuzzy cross between a wordless picture book and a graphic novel. Our hero is a little girl who likes to fix things and she saves a cute little robot from capture by the big bad robots with only the help of a wrench. I've read several of Hatke's books and his art is adorable. The majority of this title is wordless, next come sound effects but there are speech bubbles also and I'd say this would make a good visualized story for young non-readers to interpret as well. The girl and the robots are charming and I found myself rooting for them for the entire story. The book is timeless, it could be taking place now or in the future. The cuteness and junkyard robot setting brought to mind ""Wall-E"" and I believe this is going to be an endearing tale. I loved it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJ0BNG5INTKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626720800#wasThisHelpful","R2AJ0BNG5INTKJ","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review is from the eyes of someone completely new to Fairy Tail. This is a series I haven't read yet but has been on my want-to-read list for ages. With two spin-offs coming up and a reprint omnibus of the series in the works I thought this was the perfect time to jump on board. This series focuses on Wendy and Carla with two cameos of the ""whole Fairy Tale gang"". It doesn't have much substance to it from a story perspective for a new comer but we do get to know Wendy quite well as a character and Carla certainly is a cute sidekick. A very girly-girl ""squeee"" shojo themed magic and boys manga which is not particularly my thing but the ending does make me want to read on with the next volume. I feel pretty sure fans of the series will welcome this little side adventure of a character they already love but for newbies it gives a character study and sets us down in the Fairy Tale world gently with some explanations and I didn't feel any confusion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K0TJGAEXKJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632361337#wasThisHelpful","R32K0TJGAEXKJU","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A promising new sci-fi manga series with an appeal to the adult reader. A compelling new take, for me at least, with an old man as the main character. Though they make him out to be older than he is in actual years, kind of a life has been hard on him thing. The book starts off very sad and goes into quite a deep character study of this man, his life, family and view of the world around him. Then he and a stranger and hit by a blinding light and his world is forever changed. The sci-fi angle is really cool and for a first volume a lot happens including just enough information to get the reader hooked. The book ends with the introduction of the second character and I'm really excited to see if he's going to be the protagonist to Inuyashiki. Really detailed clear art as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XXZ87HE7TYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632361213#wasThisHelpful","R10XXZ87HE7TYZ","ACEOOCYZRPWF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEOOCYZRPWF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Galina Vishnevskaya speaks at length about this recording of Eugene Onegin, made in 1955, in her autobiography.  An opera recording by the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow in the 1950s was a rare event, so we are lucky to have this one.  Ms. Vishnevskaya also mentions that she was happy that Sergei Lemshev, a famous Lensky of his day, was able to record his role for posterity. Indeed, Lemshev makes the most of his role, especially in Act 2 where he challenges Onegin to a duel.  Tatyana was one of Vishnevskaya’s signature roles and one she had a great fondness.  Her letter aria is magnificent and demands to be heard.  The singing is first rate from all.  Eugene Belov makes an outstanding Onegin and Ivan Petrov is perfect as Prince Gremin.  The Bolshoi Chorus and Orchestra are magnificent, conducted by Boris Khaikin.The recording was nicely transferred to CD. The sound is dry but there is no distortion, and to say the least it is not up to current digital standards.  The ear adjusts to the sound quality and to have a recording on Onegin from the Bolshoi is a reason to celebrate.  There is no libretto.  The booklet has a synopsis and track listing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFIAHVLIXBF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JC9L#wasThisHelpful","R1WFIAHVLIXBF9","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was interested in hearing Galina Vishnevskaya as Tosca after reading her autobiography.  Tosca was one of Galina's signature roles, and to have Mstislav Rostropovich conducting made this a must have set.  Vishnevskaya owns this role; she brings magnificent fire and sensuality to Tosca and no other singer I have heard has done.  The remaining members of the cast were unknown to me.  Franco Bonisolli makes a good Cavaradossi.  His rendering of €œE lucevan le steleâ€ is beautifully sung and has an excellent depth of emotion.  Matteo Manuguerra makes a formidable Scarpia, as evil sounding as Tito Gobi.  The supporting cast is also excellent. Antonio Zerbini makes a very good Angeloti and the sacristan is nicely sung by Guido Mazzini.Tosca was recorded in 1976.  The recording was nicely transferred to CD and is clear and well-balanced.  Maestro Rostropovich gets an excellent performance from the Orchestre National de France bring the right touch of drama to the score.  Highly recommended.  If you have one or more recordings of Tosca in your collection you will want to add this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300KB3G8D9JZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00099BPOC#wasThisHelpful","R300KB3G8D9JZI","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the Fritz Reiner set as a most welcomed Christmas present.  I had a few of the LP and CD reissues of a few of the 63 discs in the set but the overwhelming majority are new to me. The discs are issued with the original LP covers, down to the comments, in extremely fine print, on the back cover.  The CDs reproduce the look of the original LP down to the side 1 label.  The sound quality is clear and crisp as anyone who heard the original Living Stereo recordings will remember.  The only time I heard some minor distortion was in the Rhapsodie Espagnole and one of the Rossini overtures. There is much to like and far more than I can mention here.  I had not heard Fritz Reiner conduct any Mozart and Haydn and the performances came as a pleasant and welcome surprise.  Some highlights of the set.• Respighi: Fountains of Rome, Pines of Rome. Arguably, the best recording of the Pines and Fountains.• Beethoven: Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No 5 (Emperor).  Van Cliburn is superb in this performance.• Mahler: The Song of the Earth. Beautifully recorded with Richard Lewis and Maureen Forrester.• Beethoven: Symphony No.5, Coriolan Overture. A magnificent no nonsense recording if the famous 5th.•  Berlioz/deFalla: Nuit d’Ete, El amor brujo. Fabulous performances by the young Leontyne Price.• Bartok: Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta, Hungarian Sketches. Still the standard recordings of this music.• Festival: Kabalevsky's Colas Breugnon, Tchakovsky’s March Slav and Miniature Overture and Glinka's Russlan and Lyudmila Overture. A magnificent disc of Russian music with the odd title Festival and cover of a Chinese dragon. Presumably the Cold War was responsible for not calling the disc Russia, following the trend of Spain and Vienna.• Hovhaness/Stravinsky: Mysterious Mountain, Divertimento. Legendary performances.• Spain: de Falla: The Three-Cornered Hat: Dances; La vida breve: Interlude and Dances; Albinez: Iberia: Triana and Fete-dieu a Seville, Navarra; Granados: Goyescas: Intermezzo. For me, the Albenez orchestrations are the highlight of this disc.• The Reiner Sound - Ravel: Rhapsodie Espagnole, Pavane for a Dead Princess; Rachmaninoff: Isle of the Dead. A beautifully played account of Rhapsodie Espagnole and the Pavane and an atmospheric account of Isle of the Dead.• Prokofieff/Stravinsky: Lieutenant Kije, Song of the Nightingale. Two classic records of these works.Arguably, the most important composers for Fritz Reiner were Richard Strauss and Bela Bartok.  The earliest recording in the set is the fabulous Also Sprach Zarathustra and Ein Heldenleben, both recorded in 1954.  The recordings of Sinfonia Domestica and the Bourgeois Gentilhomme Suite are also not to be missed, while the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra, Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste and the Hungarian Sketches are benchmark recordings. The collection includes a short bonus disc containing a never released Bach concerto and a brief comment by Fritz Reiner on Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony.If you enjoyed the Living Stereo recordings of Fritz Reiner in the past or you want to discover these fabulous recordings for the first time, this will be a wonderful set to have","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DAIE12A8PMSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT70J0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3DAIE12A8PMSG","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Erwin Schulhoff was born in 1894 in Prague to a prosperous Czech Jewish family.  He was a child prodigy; and when Antonin Dvorak heard him perform on the piano in 1901, he predicted a great musical future for the seven-year-old. Eventually, Schulhoff studied music in Prague, followed by the conservatories in Leipzig and Cologne. Among his teachers were the composers Max Reger and Claude Debussy.  He was a talented pianist as well as a revolutionary composer. During the 1930s, Schulhoff faced mounting personal and professional difficulties due to his Jewish descent and his Communist sympathies. His music was labeled degenerate and he was blacklisted by the Nazi party.  Eventually, he could no longer give recitals in Germany and his music was no longer performed, finding employment as a radio pianist.  Unfortunately, he waited too long before trying to leave Czechoslovakia and although the Soviet Union had approved his petition for citizenship, he was arrested in 1941 and deported to the Wulzburg concentration camp where he died in August 1942.Schulhoff came to turn away from traditional musical forms, and briefly embraced Dadaism and was very enthusiastic about jazz and ragtime. He was influenced by the atonality of Schoenberg and Alban Berg, and also the neoclassicism of Stravinsky and Hindemith. Schulhoff was especially close to Leos Janacek, and he later wrote an essay about Janacek’s life and work.  Despite all of these diverse influences, Schulhoff has a distinctive voice, and he has an excellent advocate in James Conlon.Schulhoff’s Fifth Symphony was composed during 1938 – 39, the time of the Anschluss and the Munich Agreement that ceded the Sudaten land to Germany.  The first movement of the symphony is angry and threatening, anticipating the war to come.  It is similar in its relentless agitation as Gustav Holst’s Mars.  The second movement (an Adagio) follows up on the mood of the first movement, reflecting it seems on the destruction of war.  The opening mournful melody gives way to a more reflective mood, still shrouded in sadness, with frequent outbursts from the brass.  The Scherzo third movement (marked Allegro con brio) is restless and agitated, and carries over to the beginning of the finale.  The finale is characterized by the menace and violence of the prior movements.  There is a brief quiet section that slowly builds in intensity followed by a heroic theme for brass and strings, and the symphony ends in a triumphant mood.  The music is an expression of the time when it was written, and Shostakovich’s Fourth Symphony came to mind as music reflecting another political reality.The Suite for Small Orchestra could not be more different from his Fifth Symphony.  Jazz was important to Schulhoff’s composition and he worked as a jazz pianist. The suite is in six short movements titled: Ragtime, Valse Boston, Tango, Shimmy, Step and Jazz. The suite is brilliantly conceived and great fun to listen to.  The Second Symphony was composed in 1932, and shows some neo-classical influence in the final movement with its borrowing from Beethoven.  The first movement has a charming dance-like melody followed by a peaceful Andante for strings and woodwinds; the third movement is a Jazz Scherzo, which including a banjo.Erwin Schulhoff’s music is coming back with performances and recordings.  Mr. Conlon conducted the Fifth Symphony during the summer at the Ravinia festival.  The recordings on this disc are magnificent, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3BK1IBVLYB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UUNBDW#wasThisHelpful","R3I3BK1IBVLYB7","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is a fantastic tribute to Leonard Bernstein.  Aside from the 10 CDs in the set are two books.  One is devoted to Mr. Bernstein containing remembrances from several orchestra members and his daughter Jamie, a chronology of important events in Bernstein's life and a chronological listing of his performances with the New York Philharmonic from 1943 - 89.  The book is illustrated with many photographs.  The second book contains program notes for each disc with artist profiles, texts of vocal works, illustrated with many photographs.Disc 1 holds Stravinsky's Song of the Nightingale, Elgar's Cockaigne Overture and Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto with Lazar Berman as soloist.  The performance of the Stravinsky and Elgar are beautifully performed. The Rachmaninov is well-played by Berman but at 44 minutes the tempi are a little slow in spots, especially in the Finale; an interesting performance but not among my favorites.  Disc 2 begins with Virgil Thomson's The Seine at Night, a magnificent, atmospheric piece from the opera Four Saints in Three Acts. This is followed by a beautifully performed Piano Concerto No. 23 of Mozart with Byron Janis as soloist, who performs with great sensitivity.  The Mozart id followed by Six Pieces for Orchestra by Webern and Paul Hindemith' Mathis der Maler Symphony.  The Webern receives a superb reading and the Hindemith is an equally superb performance.  This Mathis is equally as intense as his later recording with the Israel Philharmonic (the only difference is the vivid sound of the latter).Disc 3 begins with a charming performance of Benjamin Britten's Spring Symphony with Richard Lewis, Jennifer Vyvyan and Regina Sarfaty as soloists.  The next work, the Schumann Cello Concerto is a remarkable performance with Jacqueline du Pre from March 3, 1967, only available in this set as far as I am aware.  This is a spellbinding performance with Ms. Du Pre playing flawlessly.  The final work is Sibelius' Four Songs for Soprano and Orchestra, sung beautifully by Phyllis Curtin.  Disc 4 opens with a spirited performance of Mozart's Magic Flute Overture.  This is followed by a marvelous performance of the Beethoven Piano Concerto No 3 with a commanding performance by Wilhelm Kempff.  The remaining works on the disc is a fine performance of Lukas Foss' Quintets for Orchestra and a moving account of Aaron Copland's Dance Symphony.Disc 5 opens with a superb reading of the Prokofiev Second Piano Concerto with Vladimir Ashkenazy (his debut engagement with the NYP) turning in a magnificent performance.  This is one of the most passionate readings of this concerto that I have heard.  Next is a fabulous performance of Igor Markevitch's ballet Icare (the composer was present for this 1958 broadcast).  The final work, Arcana by Edgar Varese had not been recorded up to this performance. Disc 6 begins with a beautifully played Second Essay of Samuel Barber, followed by a very fine performance of William Russo's Symphony No 2. Maynard Ferguson is particularly excellent in the jazz inspired finale.  The final selections on the disc are Ruggles' Men and Mountains and the Second Symphony of Charles Ives.  The Ives performance is the world-premiere from February 25, 1951 and the taped broadcast was needed to be located for release on this set.Disc 7 kicks off with an impish piece by Rodion Shchedrin called Mischevious Folk Ditties, very light and fun.  The Capriccio, for piano and orchestra, by Igor Stravinsky receives an energetic performance with Seymour Lipkin as soloist.  The performance of this work was to mark the Stravinsky's 80th birthday.  This is followed by the world-premiere performance of Henze's Fifth Symphony, which was dedicated to Leonard Bernstein and the NYPH. The final selection is a beautifully played Beethoven Triple Concerto with John Corigliano (violin), Laszlo Varga (Cello) and Bernstein at the keyboard.  The tempi, especially  in the first movement, are unusually brisk and many listeners may not care for the speed of the performance but it is exciting.  Disc 8 has an interesting performance of Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto with Isaac Stern playing the violin, John Wummer on flute and Bernstein performing the harpsichord part.  The disc next has a gripping performance of Bruckner's Sixth Symphony.  Bernstein only conducted the Sixth and Ninth symphonies, and (as the program notes reveal) he fully annotated his copy of the score.Disc 9 starts off with a Young People's Concert featuring a performance of Aaron Copland's Outdoor Overture.  There follows a series of avant guard pieces were Mr. Bernstein provides an introduction before each work is performed. This set is a fantastic tribute to Leonard Bernstein.  Aside from the 10 CDs in the set are two books.  One is devoted to Mr. Bernstein containing remembrances from several orchestra members and his daughter Jamie, a chronology of important events in Bernstein's life and a chronological listing of his performances with the New York Philharmonic from 1943 - 89.  The book is illustrated with many photographs.  The second book contains program notes for each disc with artist profiles, texts of vocal works, illustrated with many photographs.The sound on the broadcasts is very good; certainly the ear adjusts to the mono sound.  There is some coughing (it sounds like a member of the orchestra is coughing in the Dawn and Duet track on disc 10) and sneezing during some of the concerts but there was nothing extreme to prevent me from enjoying the music.  There is much to like in this set, especially the Schumann Cello concerto, the Ives Second Symphony, the Beethoven Third Piano Concerto, the Prokofiev Second Piano Concerto and Bruckner's Sixth Symphony.  The Avant-Garde works are also of interest, depending on one's musical tastes, particularly for Mr. Bernstein's introductory remarks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U93SDDFIPBY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000055XDG#wasThisHelpful","R2U93SDDFIPBY7","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the excellent review by Discophage, which nicely provides a track listing of the five discs in this set. This is a magnificent set of New York Philharmonic broadcasts of American music covering the period from 1936 to 1997.  Rather than review each disc in volume 1, I will mention works that were highlights of the collection for me.There are several  works conducted in the 1950s and 1960s by Leonard Bernstein that are magnificently performed – Chadwick’s Melpomene Overture, MacDowell’s Indian Suite, excepts from acts III and IV from Virgil Thomson’s Four Saints in Three Acts, which was the only time Bernstein conducted the work.  One of the more interesting Bernstein performances is a powerful reading of Roy Harris’ Symphony No 3, which is the fastest I have heard at 16:16.Other performances of interest is a moving account of Copland’s Music for the Theater conducted by Erich Leinsdorf, Charles Martin Loeffler’s Memories of My Childhood from 1936 conducted by John Barbirolli, Artur Rodzinski turning in a spirited performance of Gershwin’s An American in Paris and a passionate reading by Howard Hansen of his Symphony No 2 conducted by the composer at Carnegie Hall, 1946. An interesting surprise was Guido Cantelli conducting Copland’s El salon Mexico from a 1955 broadcast, a superb performance of the First Essay by Samuel Barber with George Szell conducting and a fantastic reading of Paul Creston’s Symphony No 2 conducted by Pierre Monteux from 1956.The recordings are well produced and remarkably free from coughing and noise from the audience.  There is a reasonably good balance between the orchestra sections.  The booklet that accompanies the set nicely documents the recordings and provides a timetable of American music, year by year.  This is a fabulous collection of NYPO broadcasts that is a complete delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZWM8SA0047A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001PDYLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NZWM8SA0047A","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot agree with Amazon Customer about the tempi Tadaaki Otaka adopted for his Glazunov cycle. If I compare timings from Jose Serebrier for the Fifth Symphony (11:40, 4:54, 9:24, 6:45), who adopts brisk tempi and Valery Polansky (12:19, 4:56, 9:48, 7:56), who is slower in general in his recordings of the symphonies, to Otaka (12:39, 4:59, 9:52, 7:34) it is clear that this set falls in a medium tempo that is not breaking any speed records.  As for the performances, the First Symphony (composed in 1882 when Glazunov was 16 years old) is beautifully played with excellent medium tempi and performed with a feel for the music.  The Second Symphony from 1886 shows greater maturity in Glazunov’s handling of the symphonic form but also shows the influence of the “Mighty Handful” in the oriental melodies of the second movement.Glazunov broke free from the “Mighty Handful” when he composed his Third Symphony (1888 – 90) following the more cosmopolitan example of Tchaikovsky (to whom the Third was dedicated).  The melodies and orchestration of this symphony are more complex than his previous symphonies. With the Fourth Symphony (1893), Glazunov achieved his mature style.  The opening bars, with a sort of orchestral sigh from the orchestra announced a departure from the earlier symphonies.  The symphony is also cast in three movements, the only time the composer altered the form of the symphony. The music is beautifully expressive and noble, and is beautifully captured by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. With this symphony, and the death of his friend Tchaikovsky, Glazunov became the most eminent among Russian composers.The Fifth Symphony (1895) established Glazunov’s reputation in Europe and America.  The wealth of wonderful melodies in the symphony make it very appealing with an energetic tutti opening by the orchestra, a charming Scherzo and w reflective and dramatic Andante topped off by an exuberant and festive  Finale.  The Sixth Symphony (1896) is a mix of a dramatic first movement with lighter inner movements and a finale of variations.  The Seventh Symphony (1901 – 02) has an opening similar to Beethoven’s Pastoral symphony, and has been applied to this symphony.  Although the first movement suggests the Russian countryside, the remaining three movements are more urban in character.  The Eighth Symphony (1902 – 06) represents a summing up of Glazunov’s skill as a composer.  The music of the first movement is somber and dramatic, followed by a reflective and passionate slow movement.  The Scherzo is not s lyrical as earlier symphonies and the Finale builds from a somber beginning to a triumphant conclusion.This cycle of Glazunov symphonies has several interesting fillers: the Mazurka in G major, From Darkness to Light and the Ballade in F major.  Overall, this set has excellent performances of the symphonies.  I tend to prefer the symphonies by Neeme Jarvi and the Bamberg (I find he is a bit more energetic in the Fifth) but this set is impressive in the quality of the playing and the leadership of Tadaaki Otaka.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LG1QQC2SAA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PTYJNA#wasThisHelpful","R36LG1QQC2SAA2","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this disc in a library, El Mundo being a period performance group with which I was unfamiliar.  This is a colorful and thought provoking disc beautifully played and sung.  This theme of this disc is Spanish music of the 17th and 18th centuries and its influence throughout Europe.  The diverse musical pieces come from several European and New World (Lima and Peru) composers. The disc begins, appropriately with an orchestral work by Domenico Scarlatti, who for many years was the composer to Portuguese and Spanish royal families.  Perhaps the most interesting work is a short cantata in Spanish by George Frederic Handel, composed in 1708. Handel was living in Naples at the time where Spanish music was all the rage.  This is the only work by Handel that was composed for guitar.I like a program of early music that that blends instrumental and vocal music.  The program presented by El Mundo is perfect.  The instrumental works are perfectly played with a real feeling for the music.  The soloists: Jennifer Ellis Kampani, Nell Snaidas and Paul Shipper are magnificent, providing a freshness and clarity to the music.  The recording is well balanced and clear.  This is a pleasant disc that makes me want to explore the other recordings of El Mundo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8J1TYUJI69HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P96WSG#wasThisHelpful","R8J1TYUJI69HA","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karol Szymanowski wrote his music for the violin for his close friend Pawel Kochanski, aiming to create a new mode of expression for the violin.  The First Violin Concerto was composed in 1916, and has been described an exotic and even erotic.  It is cast in a single movement with three sections.  Szymanowski was, at the time, under the influence of Greek mythology and Arabic culture, which accounts for the impressionistic atmosphere of the music.  The concerto is structured on short melodies that are woven together without a specific form.  There is a short cadenza for the soloist, leading into the passionate finale, but the violin dominates the musical conversation with the orchestra and has the last word.The Second Violin Concerto came 16 years later in 1932-33. The concerto is in two sections linked by a lengthy cadenza that Kochanski (who also composed it) wanted as he considered the concerto too short.  The concerto differs from the sensuality of the earlier concerto in that it is more conventional in its tone, sounding closer to Bartok’s Violin Concerto No 2.  At the time he composed his second concerto, Szymanowski was under the influence of Goral folk music.  The first movement is a series of variations and the second a rondo. Sadly, Pawel Kochanski performed the concerto for the first (and only) time on October 6, 1933 in Warsaw Philharmonic Hall.  In fact, this was the violinist’s last heroic performance as he was suffering from cancer of the liver, and died in New York on January 12, 1934.The remaining pieces on this disc are for solo violin and piano; beginning with the Three Paganini Caprices (1918).  Szymanowski set his own variations from Paganini’s Caprice 21, 22 and 24.  The Romance for violin and piano (1910) is a sweetly melodious piece, beautifully written for the violin.These are superb performances by Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Thomas Zehetmair is an ideal soloist; bring forth the exotic and sensual aspects of the music beautifully. The recording is perfectly balanced and clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4YZE3FN6CX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TGZX4S#wasThisHelpful","R1P4YZE3FN6CX7","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This main interest of this CD are two rarities by Edouard Lalo; the Piano Concerto from 1888 and the Romance Serenade for Violin and Orchestra composed in 1878. The Piano Concerto is a dramatic work but lacks a cadenza for the soloist, which probably accounts for its disappearance from the concert hall. The opening movement has a brief melody that will be recognized by movie goers as the inspiration for Maurice Jarre’s Lawrence of Arabia main theme, which makes an appearance in all of the movements.  The middle movement is a beautiful, lyrical Lento followed by a heroic Finale.  The concerto is interesting with some a good dialogue between the pianist and the clarinets, basses and cellos.  The music does not have the same engagement as do the piano concerti of Camille Saint Saens, but it is interesting in Lalo’s treatment of the “Lawrence” melody.The disc also contains a fine performance of the Scherzo from 1884 and Lalo’s Symphony (1889) receives a good performance that, except for the finale, where the slow tempi from conductor Nikos Athinaos makes the music sound plodding.  For a better recording of this magnificent symphony seek out the recording by the Radio Orchestra of France conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham or the performance by the Basler Sinfonie Orchester under Giancarlo Andretta. The short Romance Serenade for Violin and Orchestra is a charming work that brings out the sweetness of the violin.  This is a work that should be heard in performance and is unjustly neglected.The recording is clear and well-balanced, with David Gross (in the piano concerto) and Juri Toschmakow (Romance Serenade) turning in good performances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3045NVBK6MBR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000253B6#wasThisHelpful","R3045NVBK6MBR0","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Gone for a book club and have not read any of James Paterson's books prior to this one.  The book immediately struck me that it was written for a film or cable mini-series.  One thing I found odd was the shift in person from the first person where detective Michael Bennett is involved in the story to third person for the chapters where Bennett is not.  Presumably, Mr. Paterson did the Michael Bennett chapters and Michael Ledwidge did the others.  My writing classes always stressed that a single voice is a better and I find the switching back and forth annoying.There is not much character development; we get a series of events but not a deep probing of the characters.  I found myself wondering about why Mary Catherine is so satisfied being a nanny to 10 children on a farm miles away for a large city. Is she really so altruistic or does she sometimes wish for a different life?  The lack of development is due to the fast pace of the book: the chapters are very short, the longest about five pages, which keeps the story moving but strips out details.  We get emotions written in a kind of short hand. .For example, when Leo, one of the agents protecting Michael Bennett's family is killed, Mary Catherine (who sees Leo as a love interest) has the following reaction: ""Mary Catherine felt a shiver of cold shoot up her back as her breath left her. Leo was shot? He was dead! No! How! What!""Later, when Bennett is told about the danger his family is in, he has a similar reaction:' ""What? How? Where"" came Mike's voice from the old CB receiver in front of Mary Catherine.' What exactly is Bennett feeling? It is far easier to use these staccato phrases than describe to the reader how a character feels, but the latter takes time and effort.Other reviewers have mentioned that Gone is predictable, and indeed there are no surprises or plot twists. The book goes on its way in a linear path with what we know will be inevitable coming to pass.  Gone (it is amazing how many books have this title) is an entertaining and fast paced read which is perfect as a travel book.  One could almost certainly complete the book over a couple of long flights and be happily occupied. For those readers who are not fans and like a clever plot and more substance to their characters, there is a need to look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSWSP9WO9881B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455515841#wasThisHelpful","RSWSP9WO9881B","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music on this disc covers Albert Roussel's career from his early Sonatine from 1912 to his Trois Pieces from 1934.  I know Roussel's orchestral music well and this was my introduction to his piano works.  The Sonatine the writing reminds one of Maurice Ravel, with a touch of Erik Satie tossed in.  Le Marchand de sable qui passé (The Sandman) was composed in 1908 as incidental music for a one-act play, and reminded me of Debussy in the dreamy and elegant Scene II and the melancholy of the Interlude. The mysterious and dreamy sound of the music brings Pelleas to mind, and is well suited to the subject of the Sandman bringing a man and woman together in a forest.The energy of Trois Pieces, OP 49 (1934) is welcome after the dreamy Sandman. The opening melody with it jagged rhythm is pure Roussel and the middle movement waltz makes a charming interlude; the spirited finale, with its dramatic slow melody, leaves one smiling.  The Prelude and Fugue, OP 46 (1932) was written as homage to Bach.  The Prelude was added in 1934, after the Fugue, based on Bach's name, was composed.The remaining four short works capture various moods. Doubt (1919) is highly tormented and L'Accueil des Muses (1920) was a contribution piece to homage to Debussy, who had died in 1918. Segovia was dedicated to the famous guitarist and is a colorful piece based on Spanish melodies.  The final work Conte a la poupee (Doll's Tale) 1904 is a charming lullaby. The pianist, Jean-Pierre Armengaud, is new to me, and he performs the music beautifully with great expression, clearly having affection for Roussel's music","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCXW309QW67HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ97YG4#wasThisHelpful","RCXW309QW67HE","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not agree more with the other reviewers that this is the finest L’Enfant et les Sortileges that has been recorded.  The 1948 recording by Ernest Baur has some fine singing and the orchestra is wonderful but the performance conducted  by Lorin Maazel simply sparkles. Francoise Ogeas is perfect as the Child, with an expressive voice that completely convinces you she is a spoiled child. The music is beautifully played.  I particularly enjoy the garden scene with the sounds of nature that Ravel so cleverly reproduces.  L’Enfant was composed from 1917 to 1925 to a text by Collette, and was premiered in Monte Carlo in 1925. Although it is considered opera, there are extended ballet sequences that were choreographed for the premiere by Georges Balanchine.L’Heure espagnole, an opéra-bouffe, was composed in 1907, intended as a gift to Ravel’s father for his support for his son’s choice of career, and based on a popular play of the same name.  Ravel’s father died, however, before the work could be staged.  The orchestration is colorful and imaginative, opening  in a clock shop with Ravel mimicking the sounds of the clocks using metronomes, bells, chimes, xylophone, whip, muted horns and a trombone.  The opera is a comedy of manners with the clockmaker Torquemada being cuckolded by Gonzalve, a poet, who hides in a grandfather clock.  In fact, Concepción, Torquemada’s wife, has a number of gentlemen friends, and another admirer, Don Iñigo, also hides in a grandfather clock.  The cast in this recording includes Jane Berbie (Concepción), Jean Giraudeau (Torquemada) and Jose van Dam (Don Iñigo ).The fillers on this two disc set – Rimsky-Korsakov’s Capriccio espagnol and Stavinsky’s Le Chant du rossignol – are beautifully performed. I cannot think of a better recording of either piece. The music is lovingly played in this recording by the Orchestre Nationale de la ER.T.E under the direction of the late Lorin Maazel. The booklet has the libretti and excellent notes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWTCHFJH8SBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GXR#wasThisHelpful","R1FWTCHFJH8SBG","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sergei Prokofiev’s Sixth Symphony is a favorite of mine, so when I came across this CD at my library I was highly interested.  I found the performance to be a good but not a great one.  I like the energy that Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony Orchestra bring to the first movement, which comes off powerfully with a good tempo.  By contrast, the middle movement is taken too slow to be plodding in some sections.  Slatkin’s timing in this movement is 16:51 as compared to Mravinsky (on Russian disc) which clocks in at 12:55.  The Finale has good level of energy, but the orchestra’s performance is a bit lackluster. A high point is the great brass climax which is played magnificently. The great orchestral screams at the end of the movement are a bit drawn out and the concluding bars do not have the drama and the underlying threat that Mravinsky and Valery Gergiev bring to the score.  My favorite recordings of the Sixth remain Mravinsky, Gergiev and Jarvi.The Overture of Hebrew Themes is well played with the musicians entering into the playful spirit of the music. The suite from Love for Three Oranges receives a good performance but not a deeply memorable one. The recording is clear with a good separation of the instruments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLEHEKOHY93X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009W8S#wasThisHelpful","R3OLEHEKOHY93X","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The packaging for Patriotism is elegantly designed. The DVD case resembles a book in the fine paper used as a cover and the print of Mishima as Lieutenant Takeyama, seated, darkly lighted, staring at a dagger in front of him.  The DVD case is similar in design and is accompanied by a book that contains the story Patriotism, production notes by Mishima and an essay by Tony Rayns on the making of the film.  The booklet is nicely illustrated with still pictures from the film and a group photograph on Mishima and his co-star with the production crew.I have been curious about Patriotism since I first saw Paul Schrader’s film back in 1985.  I was unaware that Mishima’s widow had all prints of Patriotism destroyed, except for the negative. The film was far more artistic in rendering its subject than I expected. The opening where a ghostly outline of Mishima is caressing his wife was an interesting touch. The lighting is very beautifully handled with beautiful shadings of light and dark. I think that non-Japanese viewers should see the slightly longer English version before viewing the Japanese version. It is advantageous to have read the story written out in English on the scrolls.  The new high definition restoration enhances the film beautifully.  I was naturally wondering how the act of committing seppuku would be depicted on the screen.  It was blood but not unnecessarily gory, and the intent by Mishima was not to shock but treat ritual suicide with some poetry.  This is especially true of the final frames of the film where the Lieutenant and Reiko ((Yoshiko Tsuruoka) are shown in a kind of apotheosis, joined forever in death.The extras are interesting.  The 45-minute documentary with members of the film’s production staff provides a lot of insight into the making of Patriotism. The audio only extra of Mishima giving a speech in English to the  Foreign Correspondents' Association is interesting in all of the candid comments he provide his audience but also for his command of English.  The last extra is a short interview Mishima gave on war and death.  The interview was amazing for his comments and also that he did not look directly into the camera, perhaps feeling uncomfortable being filmed.This set is a must for anyone with an interest in Yukio Mishima but anyone with an interest in art films will find this an amazing film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KX3X45SIB6K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016AKSOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KX3X45SIB6K4","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sixth Symphony of Anton Bruckner was composed between 1879 and 1881, and was dedicated to his landlord and his wife.  It is the only one of his symphonies that the composer did not extensively revise.  Bruckner thought his Sixth was his boldest symphony, terming it somewhat reckless or impetuous. The music is close to the Linz version of the First Symphony that Bruckner nickname ""das kecke Beserl"" (""saucy maid"").  Critics, however, have considered it the ugly duckling of Bruckner’s works, and it was not regularly performed.  Time has changed opinions and the Sixth is seen as rich in melodies, some sounding cinematic in character) with an imaginative orchestration.  The first movement is uncharacteristic of Bruckner in that it sets off at a gallop instead of the usual quiet tremolo opening of the strings, and the opening marking “Majestoso” (majestic, august, or kingly) instead of the more conventional ""Maestoso.""The performance by the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Jaap van Zweden, is a great reading of the score. The first movement is simply majestic; the Adagio is movingly expressive while the Scherzo is ebullient and full of playful energy.  The Finale is difficult to bring off due to the wildly contrasting melodies.  Jaap van Zweden manages to find the perfect tempi for the abrupt switches coming up with a thrilling Finale.This is certainly one of the top recordings of the Sixth.  I did not have issues with the recorded sound but that may be because I listen with headphones.  This is a recording that anyone interested in Bruckner’s music should have in their library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VUP6YFBAFXQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2RAOHI#wasThisHelpful","R2VUP6YFBAFXQX","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter O’Toole proves in this book that he was not only a great actor but a fine writer.  The book is written in short unconnected episodes, as if we were having a conversation with Mr. O'Toole.  From the book we learn that Mr. O’Toole had a happy and charming childhood with a bookmaker father and house wife mother.  He does tend to focus a great deal about Adolf Hitler, so much that it becomes obsessive. He relates Hitler’s biography in some detail and occasionally brings him up like a boogey man.  This showed to me how deeply the war and its deprivations struck Mr. O’Toole that he brings the subject up so often in his book.  As he says in this book: “I went straight from infancy to youth. Childhood meant war, barbed wire, and sandbags.”Here is a short excerpt when Peter received a gas mask which shows his gift for description. “We had gone to war to fight Hitler, I soon learned, even as I was handed my gas mask.  It was in a plain cardboard box which had a string strap for hanging on your shoulder.  The contraption itself was strange. A little black pig with a window.  A rubber article which was easy fun to put on but soon became a bugger to wear.  Mine smelt of cold hot-water bottles and was difficult to breathe in, and the window misted up as I was trying to cop a squint of myself in a mirror.”My favorite parts of the book come near the end when Mr. O’Toole is auditioning for the Royal Acting College.  I found it interesting that he read and recited Shakespeare with his family, and so his natural acting abilities were fostered when he was a boy.  It was also amusing when he referred to his wife, Sian Philips, as his widow.  He does hit the right mark, as those of us who have divorced after a long marriage can attest to.Loitering with Intent is a beautifully written book that anyone with an interest in Peter O’Toole would find of interest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHGNY47U1VQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1562828231#wasThisHelpful","R3DHGNY47U1VQ6","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first volume in the Academy of Ancient Music - Christopher Hogwood complete recordings of the Haydn symphonies (a series of 15 volumes that was discontinued before completed).  The opening set encompasses the early symphonies composed ca. 1757 - 60 and consists of numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 18, 27, 32, 37 and 107. The dating of Haydn's early symphonies is problematic due to the lack of original manuscripts and documentation about their performance.  Two of the symphonies in this group show Haydn experimenting with the symphonic form by including an opening Adagio for symphonies 5 and 11.Many of the symphonies are in three movements, following the fast-slow-fast of the Italian Sinfonia with the more traditional four movements coming with symphonies 5, 11, 32 and 37.  The Symphony 107 is actually an early symphony, in three movements, that was published in the 1950s.  The performances do not have a continuo as there is no evidence from autograph scores that Hayden used a keyboard instrument in his symphonies. The performances by the Academy of Ancient music are superb and beautifully recorded. The booklet accompanying the set is very informative and well-written.

"As other reviewers have noted, this recording of Prokofiev's piano concerti and the First Violin Concerto have also been released as part of a six disc RCA-Sony collection of Erich Leinsdorf's Prokofiev recordings. I have listened to that set and the Testament and favor the re-master sound by Testament.  The distortion that I found, particularly in the first and third piano concerti, is much improved by Testament, and is the one I favor.This set was the first time that all five of Sergei Prokofiev's piano concerti had been recorded, and remains the set to have.  The concerti are beautifully performed by John Browning.  The First is full of boyish energy; the Second fully has Prokofiev's sense of drama and satiric wit, and the Third is marvelously energetic and witty. The Fourth is elegantly performed and certainly among the very best performances. Likewise, the Fifth is a wonderful recording that rivals the highly regarded DG recording by Sviatoslav Richter.  William Kapell and Martha Argerich maybe more exhilarating and bold in the Prokofiev Third but John Browning is elegant and penetrating but not overtly emotional. Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony are wonderful Prokofiev interpreters.The First Violin Concerto is beautifully performed by Erick Friedman, a student of Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein.  The music is expressive of the exotic and dream-like melodies of the concerto, and I can't think of a better played performance.The notes by Robert Layton are very detailed and make interesting reading, which is another plus over the Sony set which comes without a booklet","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4N5XRP2TGBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VXZE0#wasThisHelpful","R2J4N5XRP2TGBO","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Gladiator Only Dies Once is the second collection of short stories by Steven Saylor in his Roma Sub Rosa series.  This set of stories gives more background on Gordianus the Finder and puts him in some grave danger in the process.In the first story, The Consul’s Wife, Gordianus is asked to investigate whether the newly elected consul Decimus Brutus is in danger of being murdered by his wife Sempronia.  The story includes chariot races at the Circus Maximus, and it is a delight to read an accurate description of the races instead of something modeled after a Hollywood movie.  If a Cyclops Could Vanish in the Blink of an Eye concerns Gordianus’ domestic life.  Eco is missing some of his favorite toys (figurines of Cerberus, Cyclops etc) and there is no explanation of how they are disappearing. In The White Fawn, Gordianus undertakes dangerous mission to Spain to convince Lucius, the grandson of patrician Gaius Claudius, to return home.  The young man has gone to Spain to join the rebellion of Sertorious, and Gordianus has to tread carefully so the rebels do not take him for a spy and the Roman troops seeking to destroy Sertorius do not mistake him for a rebel.  Something Fishy in Pompeii is an entertaining story involving Lucius Claudius and something suspicious going on at his garum factory in Pompeii. Archimedes Tomb is an interesting story that takes place in Sicily, and brings back Cicero, who was serving a term as the Roman administrator of the western half of the island.  Gordianus and Eco are visiting Sicily on business and are invited to dinner by Cicero, who has invited three Sicilians as well; dinner, however, leads to murder.Death by Eros is a more straightforward murder mystery where a seemingly popular young man has been killed at a gymnasium, just after winning an athletic competition.  The title story, A Gladiator Only Dies Twice, finds Gordianus in danger when he is hired to find the gladiator brother of a woman.  The difficulty is that he was killed in a fight but apparently was seen alive.  Life for Gordianus gets more complicated when the woman who hired him insists on accompanying him on the search.  Poppy and the Poisoned Cake deals with an historical figure – Lucius Gellius Poplicola, who is one of the Censors.  Poppy is fond of some cakes made by a local baker. One day, the slave who fetched the cake had a little taste and died on the spot, and Gordianus needs to find the would-be murderer while taking care to keep what he is doing a secret. The final story – The Cherries of Lucullus – involves the famous Roman general who defeated Mithradates.  Gordianus is summoned to investigate a slave who may be trying to kill the general.Steven Saylor is not only a superb writer of mysteries; he also deftly provides a history of Roman private life in his stories.  In this volume, the reader finds out quite a lot about what it was like to attend a chariot race, the making of garum, a history lesson about Sicily, an interesting perspective on gladiatorial fighting, the functions of the office of Censor and how cherries were introduced to the western world.  The only comment I have is that gladiators fought with a referee present who could stop the fighting, if necessary.  Such a figure is not included in the title story.  The story works better if there isn’t a referee but it is inaccurate to how gladiators fought. This aside, Mr. Saylor is a fabulous writer and one finishes one of his books looking forward to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1364EQ5U2ZV4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312357443#wasThisHelpful","R1364EQ5U2ZV4K","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased my 21-bottle wine cellar from Brookstone, who sells the 18-bottle cellar at Amazon.  When delivered, the box was a bit unwieldy due to its size but the cellar itself is easy to pick up and move. Please read the short owner's manual that comes with the unit; there are instructions on setting up the unit. The wine cellar should not be positioned and turned immediately on as it needs some time to acclimate.I set mine up in my basement, screwing the handle in place, and let the unit sit overnight.  The next day, I plugged the unit in and set the temperatures, allowing the cellar to reach its designated temperatures. Only then did I put the wine bottles inside.  The unit works beautifully and quietly. Because of the relative coolness of the basement, the cellar does not need to switch on and off very often. When it does it is very quiet.  The unit should be place somewhere where it will not be subjected to excessive heat, such as a garage.  The unit maintains a steady temperature for the wine, and chilling the whites perfectly while the red wines stay at their slightly warmer temperature.  This is a perfect unit for keeping a collection of fine wines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DA7SQDYT4HUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN8P7LU#wasThisHelpful","R3DA7SQDYT4HUG","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third volume of the Discovering a Legend series of recordings by pianist Vera Gornostaeva. While volumes one and two focused on solo piano works, this time we are treated to the Fifth Piano Concerto (Emperor) of Beethoven and the D minor Piano Concerto (No. 20) of Mozart. In both concerti Ms. Gornostaeva turns in magical performances. Her playing is poetic; she seems to instinctively draws out the precise intonation and color of the music, and is powerful but elegant in her playing. She has been called “a True Treasure of Russian culture.”Ms. Gornostaeva is well supported by the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Vladimir Fedoseyev, in the Beethoven and the State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Russia, conducted by Saulis Sondeckis. The recordings were made in performance on October 11, 1974 and April 21, 1987.  The quality of the record is excellent but these are not digital recordings and one can detect some dryness in the sound quality of the Emperor. The Mozart has clearer and brighter sound.  There is no audience noise in either concerto. I highly recommend these recordings, despite how many recordings one has of these concerti, this disc should be in your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPN1IPV3QJDH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWZCVN0#wasThisHelpful","RPN1IPV3QJDH5","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the reviews concerning this set compared to the same performances offered by Testament and decided on this set to take advantage of having all of the Prokofiev records by Erich Leinsdorf.  My first recording of the Fifth was the 1963 performance by the Boston Symphony, and I well remember the so-called Dynagroove process. It is nice to be able to hear this recording again.  I have not previously heard any of the other performances on this set.The Second Symphony is expertly performed. I think, however, that Valery Gergiev gets a more of a visceral punch from the LSO, especially in the first movement; but this reading is a very satisfying performance.  The Sixth Symphony is also well played but I think that Valery Gergiev and Yevgeny Mravinsky bring more power to the music, especially in the orchestral scream in the final movement.  The recording quality for the Sixth is not as good as the other symphonies.  The Third Symphony gets a magnificent and powerful performance with well judged tempi and beautiful playing by the Boston Symphony.  The Fifth is among the best recordings of the symphony.The piano concerti with John Browning and the Boston Symphony are beautifully performed. The First if full of boyish energy; the Second fully has Prokofiev's sense of drama, and the Third is marvelously energetic and witty.  The Fourth is elegantly performed and certainly among the very best performances.  Likewise, the Fifth is a wonderful recording that rivals the DG recording by Sviatoslav Richter.  John Browning is superb in all five concerti. I detected some infrequent sound distortion in the piano concerti (I listen with headphones), particularly in some of louder the piano passages and when the full orchestra plays, as at the conclusion of the Third concerto.The Violin Concerti are well recorded. The First Concerto is lovingly played by Erick Friedman with a superb performance by the Boston Symphony.  The Second Concerto is beautifully played by the young Itzhak Perlman, but I found the Finale taken at bit too slow.  My favorite recording of the concerto remains Gil Shaham with the LSO conducted by Andre Previn.  The selections from Romeo and Juliet are well chosen and nicely performed. It has been some time since I have heard the Lieutenant Kije suite, which includes the part for baritone in the Romance and Trioka. The performance is charming and beautifully played.Overall, this set is an excellent buy for the excellent performances that are included.  The music was recorded from 1963 - 1969 and is generally good.  For me, the sound for the Sixth Symphony was murky and probably detracts from the performance.  The occasional distortions in the piano concerti do make me interested in the Testament edition.  The lack of a booklet is a bit of a turn off as it would have been a plus to have the original notes transferred to the CDs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA8OV9ZMCTCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6P2LA#wasThisHelpful","RJA8OV9ZMCTCW","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw the trailers for Le Week-End, it appeared to be an affectionate and playful romp in Paris between a middle-aged husband and wife celebrating their anniversary. Scenes like skipping out of an expensive restaurant without paying the bill and meeting an old friend named Morgan (played by Jeff Goldblum) where fairly light hearted. The film is actually a more serious examination of a 30 year old marriage. Nick (Jim Broadbent) and Meg (Lindsay Duncan) are a modest, slightly frumpy couple. Nick remarks in the film that you can’t love and hate the same person but ha and Lindsay are in a world inhabited by disappointment and the drudgery of living together (we learn that Meg has had an affair in the past). They have two sons who prey upon the good nature of Nick whenever they want money.(spoilers)The trip to Paris is meant to awaken the passions of the past but from the start there are disappointments. The Montmartre hotel where they spent their honeymoon has turned into a non-descript and slightly seedy.  Meg checks them into a far grander hotel near the Seine with views of the Eiffel Tower. Nick and Meg set out to visit Paris but there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction.  When Nick tries to get affectionate with Meg, she rebuffs him, forcing him on his knees. Meg complains about Nick’s need for stability and appears that she would rather free herself from him permanently.The climax of the film comes when they are invited to the Rue d Rivoli apartment of Morgan, who was at college with Nick and looks up to him as a mentor.  Morgan has divorced his wife, married a young and dotting woman who is pregnant and has a book coming out. He appears to be the epitome of success. That is, until Nick has talk with Morgan’s young son from his first marriage. He learns that Morgan is terrible at communication and that his new marriage is happy at the moment but who can say when his new wife will wake up to discover that Morgan is a bore. Meg has met a man at the party and they are attracted to each other and she arranges to meet him after dinner. She confession what she is doing to Nick and during dinner, following a warm introduction from Morgan, Nick stands up and confesses to all of his shortcomings and makes a distinction that sex is not love. He reveals what Meg is up to and says that he has loved her for more than 30 years and always will.  The confession brings Meg around but then they are thrown out of their hotel for exceeding their credit card limit. Nick and Meg slip past the hotel staff and flee to the nearest café.  There they are met by Morgan, whom they have phoned, and he offers to help them. The film ends on this high note.(end spoilers)What makes Le Week-End special is the chemistry between Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan. Both are teachers and have spent a good deal of their lives catering to their children (one of their sons is living in the basement). Their son keeps calling them, and Nick as a dutiful parent keeps answering the phone while Meg fumes.  The new future for Meg and Nick comes at the end of the film when Nick turns the phone off when his son calls. Le Week-End is an interesting melodrama about love, marriage and the difficulties of living with another person. This is a movie that will appeal to baby boomers most of all, and especially if one has had a long marriage. In the end, Meg and Nick has come a long way and still have a long way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVG1LAA0RRAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEEZSGY#wasThisHelpful","R2LVG1LAA0RRAU","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My chief interest in this recording is the premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams Eighth Symphony, which was given on May 2, 1956 by the Halle Orchestra conducted by the symphony's dedicatee Sir John Barbirolli. The concert was a televised broadcast by the BBC.  This is a passionate performance by the Halle and Barbirolli. The first movement is energetic and well-phrased for the faster variations and beautifully uplifting in the quieter, reflective ones. The Scherzo is playfully played and the slow movement is movingly played by the strings and is very heartfelt; the Toccata is exciting and boisterous.The disc has a selection of performances conducted by Sir John from 1953 and 1954 consisting of a fine performance of The Wasps Overture, Five Variants of `Dives and Lazarus', and the Fantasia on Greensleeves. All of these recordings were made with the Halle Orchestra at Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and demonstrate Barbirolli's profound understanding of the music of Vaughan Williams. The disc also has an excellent performance of the Tuba Concerto made with the London Symphony OrchestraThe recordings are sonically very good. They are not digital but each work is very clear with a good balance between sections of the orchestra. The symphony is remarkably free of any coughing or noises and the individual percussion instruments are clear. There is coughing and applause between the movements. The program for the 1956 premiere of the Eighth Symphony is available (in a PDF format) at the Barbirolli Society web site.  The program includes notes by the composer that make interesting reading. It is interesting that the symphony is simply referred to a ""Symphony in D minor.""  RVW preferred to refer to his symphonies by key until the confusion this caused was pointed out to him. The booklet is very informative and has a photograph of the score that was signed by the composer, conductor and the orchestra at the premiere concert.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TLZXMUMZ1JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005O0N1IO#wasThisHelpful","R36TLZXMUMZ1JS","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The House of the Vestals, the second book in the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor, is a collection of short stories that builds on the characters of Roman Blood.  The stories take place at different periods in the life of Gordianus The Finder, and were published in other publications prior to be joined together in this book. The stories are smaller scales investigations by Gordianus, but lack none of the intricate plots of which Mr. Saylor is a master.(some mild spoilers)The stories include an investigation into the death of an actor (Death Wears a Mask),  a story related by Bethesda on the mysterious disappearance of silver from a treasure house (The Tale of the Treasure House), Goridanus’ patrician friend Lucius Claudius witnesses a phony will (A Will Is a Way), strange goings on involving spirits of the dead (The Lemures), a false kidnapping that leads to tragedy (Little Caesar and the Pirates), the unexplained disappearance of costly silver objects from Lucius Claudius’ house (The Disappearance of the Saturnalia Silver, one of Lucius Claudius’ guest dies a mysteriously (King Bee and Honey), Gordianus tells Lucius Claudius a tale from his days in Egypt (The Alexandrian Cat) and a potential scandal involving the Vestals (The House of the Vestals).(end spoilers)The stories introduce Lucius Claudius, who will play a leading part in this collection of stories and the next, and the main characters of the future novels – Gordianus, Bethesda, Ecco and Lucius Claudius become more developed for the reader. I have read the complaint by other reviewers that the stories lack suspense as they have few plot twists and one can often figure out the conclusion relatively easily. This was true for me of some of the stories but they are so well written that I did not find that to be a problem. Mr. Saylor is informing us able Roman life in the First Century BCE.  Death Wears a Mask provides a look into the lives of actors, A Will is a Way gives a glimpse at Roman law, The Lemures shows us how they felt about ghosts, The Disappearance of the Saturnalia Silver relates how the Romans celebrated their favorite holiday, Catullus’ best of days.In sum, these stories are beautifully written and are invaluable for the development of the characters and informative of the times they are depicting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBX5I8SHE4DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312582412#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBX5I8SHE4DQ","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leopold Stokowski and Dmitri Shostakovich were good friends, and Stokowski gave the US premieres of the composer’s First, Third, Sixth and Eleventh symphonies. The Fifth Symphony, however, was Stokowski’s favorite, and one that he conducted with the London Symphony on several occasions. This is a beautifully judged reading with an intense first movement, a lively Scherzo and brooding Largo. The tempi are well chosen and the LSO responds with great emotion for the music. The Finale has all the bombast one could expect and has a rousing conclusion. The tempo markings in the printed score were in error, and so the slower tempo to emphasize the “You will rejoice” message of the composer was not followed.The magical Eighth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams caught audiences off guard when first performed in 1956. Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia gave the US premiere and Leopold Stokowski conducted the new symphony in 1957 with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall, with the composer present in the Royal Box. The lightness of the music coupled with the exotic percussion instruments (including three tuned gongs) was fresh and youthful, when something like the cataclysmic Sixth was anticipated. Stokowski conducts the symphony with an expansive tempo for the Fantasia movement, whereas most conductors are faster; the Scherzo is taken at a much faster pace (it certainly sounds more like a march than most performances), and once heard at this speed, all others pale in comparison. The meditative Cavatina is beautifully phrased and the Toccata is briskly played with much warmth and excitement.The recordings on the disc were made in September 1964 and are sonically clear,  although some definition might be is lost with the array of percussion in the Toccata of the Vaughan Williams, it is still clear enough to hear the individual .These are vigorous performances are not to be missed and despite the fact these are live performances at Royal Albert Hall, the sound is quite good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2608YX51F6M6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00076ONM8#wasThisHelpful","R2608YX51F6M6T","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vera Gornostaeva is a remarkable pianist who until recently has been unknown in the United States. Born in 1929 in the Soviet Union, Ms Gornostaeva studied with Henrich Neuhaus and has had a long and distinguished career as a performed and teacher.  She was not allowed to travel outside of her country due to her refusal to join the Communist party and for the undesirable friends she kept, among whom was Mstislav Rostropovich. Ms. Gornostaeva performed strictly in the Soviet Union even though she was frequently invited to perform in the West.  He concerts were always sold out. She is regarded as a legendary pianist, ranking among Horowitz, Richter, Gilels, Rachmaninov and Yudina.  Listening to her play, one has a feeling that she gets straight to the essence of the music.Fortunately for us, two of her students, Natalia Lavova and Vassily Primakov have rescued some of her performances that have been sitting in an archive for decades. The one presented on this disc was taken from a copy of the original tapes that no longer exist. The spring pledge drive by WFMT in Chicago featured these recordings and helped to make Vera Gornostaeva known in the US.This disc of music by Mussorgsky and Rachmaninov was recorded on April 26, 1959, and is a marvelous example of Ms. Gornostaeva’s unique talent.  Her performance of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition is flawless.  The disc also holds a selection of 10 Preludes by Rachmaninov, beginning with the famous Prelude in C sharp minor, op. 3 No. 2, played without technical exhibition yet absolutely capturing the essence of the music.  The concert ends with the Dance of the Girls with Lilies from Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet.The concert has been beautifully re-mastered. There is no noise from the audience except for applause following the Mussorgsky, the last of the Preludes and the Prokofiev.  The overall sound is very good but this is not a digital recording so there movements when the sound is a bit muffled.  The performance itself makes up for any slight sound distortions and is a must hear if you have an interest in piano performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32NIVHA56V4CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099TIV0Y#wasThisHelpful","R32NIVHA56V4CV","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Premiered in 1910, Italia is a passionate tone poem. Alfredo Casella was a fervent patriot and this work is his equivalent to Sibelius’ Finlandia and Albeniz’s Iberia. The music has a dramatic beginning, reflecting the grim conditions that existed in Sicily at the time, making use of a collection of folk tunes. The drama soon gives way to a lovely bucolic melody and the piece concludes with a rousing version of the Neapolitan tune Funiculi funicular.The short Introduzione, Corale e Marcia was composed in 1935 in the neoclassical style that Casella developed from his admiration for Igor Stravinsky. The Introduction begins with a dramatic funeral march that quickly moves to a consoling choral and finally to a triumphant military march.The Third Symphony was composed to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The first movement begins with a brief introduction moving to an energetic melody and a song-like second theme. The Andante movement has a peaceful calm, played by strings and woodwinds, which has some more ominous harmonies as the music progresses. The calm is briefly broken by a savage march that brings the movement to a climax, returning to the calm of the beginning. The Scherzo is in three sections marked “Minor”, “Major,” and “Variation.” The Minor section has a shrill, angular melody, while the Major is lyrical and lighthearted; the Variation blends the two themes together.  The Finale is an energetic Rondo that gradually builds to a climax, turning briefly to the calm of the Andante before picking up the energy of the beginning, going to a triumphant conclusion.This is the third disc from Gianandrea Noseda and the BBC Philharmonic in their Casella series, and like the first two is a rewarding look at the Italian composer. The performances are excellent and beautifully recorded with excellent balance. The booklet is well written and has some interesting photographs of Casella.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11H0WVEN6N8ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLFYWDI#wasThisHelpful","R11H0WVEN6N8ZV","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have not previously read any of John Grisham’s books and came to read The Racketeer as it was selected for a book club.  The Racketeer is about Malcolm Bannister, a former small town lawyer who was unjustly convicted of money laundering and is serving a 10 year sentence. His wife has divorced him, he is estranged from his son and his only visitor is his ex-cop father. Bannister is looking for a way out of prison when he learns of the murder of a Federal judge. The FBI has no evidence and no suspects but Bannister knows who committed the murder. The rest of the novel develops with Bannister convincing the Fed’s that he can give them the name of the murderer and will testify. But his demands must be met: Bannister wants to be placed in a witness protection program, have plastic surgery to protect his identity and receive the reward for identifying the killer of the judge.  He gets all of his demands but when the accused murderer sends a relative to kill Bannister, he goes into hiding leaving the Fed’s behind.The Racketeer is well written and great character development that makes the novel fast and interesting reading.  Mr. Grisham does a wonderful job filling us in on the legal angles of the story and his plot development with the FBI, first disbelieving Bannister and then trusting him is very good.  My only problem with the book is a lack of suspense. The plans that Bannister makes to get his life back, and more, goes off too smoothly with no surprises let alone any danger. I kept waiting for something to happen that would throw off Bannister’s well laid plans but all was as smooth as glass.  I was taught that a story needs conflict to be interesting for your readers and hold their interest. In The Racketeer, all the pieces fall neatly into place.  Bannister gets the girl he has been dreaming about, she looks like a super-model and goes along with his plans and the Fed’s seem to have a lock of interest in catching up with Bannister.  In the end, the bad guy gets what is coming to him and Bannister has his girl and is rich.  My interest was held by Mr. Grisham’s excellent writing as he laid out his story but as the plot unfolds, I was waiting for something to happen to Bannister or that something unexpected would get in his way.The bottom line for me is that The Racketeer is well written with an interesting story that could have been better if Bannister was in a bit more danger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278V6WWWCHYGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345530578#wasThisHelpful","R278V6WWWCHYGD","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leopold Stokowski and Sergei Rachmaninov were good friends.  They met when Rachmaninov made his first tour of the United States in 1909, when the composer made his debut performing his own Second Piano Concerto with the Cincinnati Symphony, conducted by Stokowski. Over the years, Stokowski gave the American premieres of The Bells and was the dedicatee of Three Russian Folk Songs. Stokowski conducted the world premier of the Third Symphony in 1936, and although the performance was excellent, critics and the public were dumbfounded by the symphony where Rachmaninov opted for shorter, less opulent melodies than he conceived for his Second Symphony.  Stokowski never conducted the Third Symphony in public again but turned to it in 1975 when he was 93 to make this recording.Stokowski's reading of the Third Symphony is exciting and bold, especially in the second movement where he adopts faster tempi than any other conductor. His Allegro vivace certainly lives up to its name. Whereas Rachmaninov's own recording of the symphony clocks in at 11:43, Stokowski's comes in at 9:49.  The faster tempi add to the overall drama of the movement, which I find an interesting alternative to the more ""accepted"" tempi.  The first movement is spacious with luminous playing by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, whose members were hand-picked by Stokowski. The melodies flow and build very gradually to the mid-movement orchestral climax with superb effect. The Finale is energetic and dramatic leaving one wanting for more The performance of the Vocalise is superb and beautifully phrased.  Stokowski provides an expansive tempo that gives the music a sensuous feel.I found myself listening in awe to this performance two or three times in a row when I received it.  The sound that Stokowski achieves is brilliant with sensitive playing from his orchestra. The sound can be termed lush and rich compared to the recording by the composer but it is a very persuasive performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8MUW8D33Y7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040Y7F6E#wasThisHelpful","R3A8MUW8D33Y7Q","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had an interest in conductor Kirill Kondrashin from his old Medlodya recordings but I was unfamiliar with the recordings from his tenure with the Royal Concertgebouw. This disc holds the Third Symphony of Sergei Prokofiev, based on music from his opera The Fiery Angel. I know of only one other recording of this symphony by Maestro Kondrashin, which was with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Like the CSO recording, this one is driven by fast tempi, which some listeners may find unsettling but, for me, is a powerful reading that captures the drama of the opera.  The timings are 11:51, 6:17, 7:24, and 6:03(with applause included). (Neemi Jarvi, by contrast, clocks in at 14:36, 7:06, 8:02, and 6:26).The disc includes Dmitri Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony, a composer with whom Maestro Kondrashin worked closely with in the 1960’s.  The performance is filled with the sort of wit and humor one associates with the Ninth. The Concertgebouw play the music lovinglyBoth are live recordings (from 1975 and 1980) and have no audience noise except for applause at the conclusion. The recordings are clear and well-balanced.

"Jep Gambardella is a successful journalist and novelist whose only book (titled The Human Apparatus), written when he was in his 20s, was wildly successful but he has not found himself able to write another. He is admired and is wealthy, living in an apartment in Rome opposite the Coliseum. Jep is a member of a broad intellectual circle of writers, actors, directors etc who enjoy the good life and party the night away. At the start of the film, Jep is celebrating his 65th birthday, and he begins to take stock of his life. He receives new that his first love, Lorena, has died. He husband has found a diary where Stefania names Jep as the love of her life while her husband was a mere good companion.  The film takes us into Jep’s life and we watch as he spends his days walking the streets of Rome, observing the life around him, and have brief affairs.  Jep’s view of life comes during a voice over, as he is walking, and explains that when he came to Rome at 26, he decided that he wanted to become “the king of the high life.” However, he did not want to be a spectator at these parties but have the power to make them fail. The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) is episodic with one scene flowing into another randomly. Jep’s character is very engrossing and I found his conversations and action interesting. One such scene is where his disparages, in a nice way, a fellow-writer Viola at a dinner party. One feels that his comments are on target, even if his observations are cruel.  The camera is simply an observer and watching the film you might wonder where the film is going.  Simply put, we are just observers of Jep’s life.  He has an affair with Ramona, the daughter of an old friend who owns a strip club.  His daughter Romona is performing while Jep is there and together they spend a few nights together.  He takes Romona on a magical late night visit to the museums and palaces of Rome, courtesy of another friend, Stefano (Giorgio Pasotti).  She has some insight into Jep and says that his writer’s block is due to his life in Rome. But as quickly as Romona enters Jep’s life, she disappears.  There are some comic elements in the film. Jep’s editor is a smart talking woman dwarf who is also a good cook and Jep at one point is set to interview a 104-year old with two cooked teeth.Toni Servillo is fabulous as Jep and Sabrina Ferilli (Romona) crafts a marvelous performance. One wishes she had more screen time.  The biggest star of the film would have to be the city of Rome, which is treated as a place of beauty but also a state of mind. An actor friend of Jep tells him late in the film that he is leaving Rome for his home town because he can’t function any more.  Director Paolo Sorrentino has been likened to Frederico Fellini (my wife agrees) but he uses comedy more in his films than Fellini, and while The Great Beauty can be termed an updated version of La Dolce Vita, Sorrentino has his own style.  I can recall the interest and excitement with a new file by Fellini opened and I felt the same feeling anticipating The Great Beauty. I am looking forward to his films to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSLQWV2BR7L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRJVHEK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSLQWV2BR7L6","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of the orchestral music of Sergei Rachmaninov is an excellent buy with some very fine performances. My first encounter with these recording was the single disc issue of the Second Symphony, a performance that I have always recommended to new listeners of classical music for the mastery of the reading. Ashkenazy at times rushes the music (compare to Andre Previn with the RPO and Valery Gergiev with the LSO) first movement is rushed in places where the music needs to be more expansive but the passionate playing by the Concertgebouw is impressive. The Scherzo is powerfully dramatic but works best when not the tempo is not pushed and Adagio is beautifully soaring and lyrical. The performance of the Symphonic Dances and Isle of the Dead are both superb readings. The Symphonic Dances are colorful and lively but also captures the darkness of the music as few performances succeed in doing.  The Isle of the Death is supremely gloomy and atmospheric, leading to a devastating climax. Vladimir Ashkenazy and the Concertgebouw performThe Third Symphony receives an exciting reading of Rachmaninov’s most nostalgic work.  The Concertgebouw is very responsive to the fast/slow tempi and give an exciting performance.  The best performance of the set is The Bells, which was Rachmaninov’s favorite among all of his works. Ashkenazy’s reading is inspired with fabulous playing from the Concertgebouw. His soloists, Natalia Troitskaya, Ryszard Karczykowski and Tom Krause, perfectly express the mood of the poems.The First Symphony is among my favorites of any composer.  The reading by Ashkenazy is very good for the first three movements, which are beautifully played with passion and power.  However, the Finale is a huge disappointment with plodding tempi. Entirely missing is the drama and sense of doom (the so-called ride to the abyss) that was captured by Evgengy Svetlanov, whose recording with his own USSR Symphony Orchestra is the best performance of this symphony. For me, it seems that Ashkenazy wishes to avoid the forward thrust of the music as it ends in a cataclysmic crash of the gong.Aside from the First Symphony, this is an excellent set with much to like in the performances. There are other recordings of Rachmaninov’s music that have finer performances, Kiril Kondrahin in the Symphonic Dances and Evgengy Svetlanov in The Bells, to name two but the Ashkenazy set is one that needs to be on everyone’s self as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1079OKIT61358/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000042HY#wasThisHelpful","R1079OKIT61358","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first recording of the Mahler Fourth was the Fritz Reiner/CSO on an RCA Living Stereo LP but I have not heard any recordings of the music in recent years. I tended to think of the Fourth as a charming precursor to Gustav Mahler’s more essential symphonies. It always was the most approachable of Mahler’s symphonies for its short length and lyrical melodies. Most conductors take a sweet approach, particularly with the final movement where the soprano soloist sings about all the delights of heaven. This recording by the Berlin Philharmonic and Claudio Abbado has changed my mind.  This is a bold reading that brings that is always thrusting forward and more than hints at the music to come.I have read a couple of reviews (not at Amazon) that are aghast that Abbado has turned a charming piece of music into something brusque and jarring.  However, it seems to me that it is valid to perform the music with emphasis on the drama.  Renee Fleming sings the Finale with luminous beauty. Her voice was criticized as being too heavy and not the imitation of a child in Heaven; rather this is a straightforward reading of the scoreThe first movement is performed at a brisk tempo, sounding playful at times and mysterious.  The Scherzo is lovingly played giving voice to the humor in the dance melody but also the darker hues of the brass.For me, Maestro Abbado’s reading of the Adagio (especially the way he takes the dramatic crescendo with the trumpets sounding mournful) places the Fourth in context with the Fifth Symphony, and hinting at things to come in the Seventh  It shows that Mahler was exploring new tonalities and textures and that his thoughts were in transition to something new.The inclusion of Alban Berg’s Seven Early Songs provides an opportunity to hear more from Renee Fleming, and the song themselves make a wonderful accompaniment to the symphony.  The Berlin Philharmonic responds beautifully to Abbado’s lead.  The recording is clear and provides wonderful detail of the BPO soloist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21NV5DDR9RP9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009YSGJ4#wasThisHelpful","R21NV5DDR9RP9Q","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Locating this disc at Amazon was quite a surprise. I enjoy recordings of composers conducting/performing their own music, and I had no idea that Jacques Ibert had recorded any of his music. The opening selection is Ibert’s famous Escales, composed in 1922 and prompted by his own travels. The performance is colorful and atmospheric, beautifully played by the Orchestre duTheatre National de l’Opera de Paris.  The musicians respond to Ibert with enthusiasm making this a performance to match others to. The ballet Les Amours de Jupiter was first performed in 1949 to a scenario by Boris Kochno, based on the loves of the god Jupiter from the Metamorphosis of Ovid. Jupiter has romantic encounters in turn with Europa, Leda, Danae and, finally, Ganymede. The ballet consists of an overture and five tableaux featuring each of Jupiter’s conquests with him returning to Juno in the final tableaux.  The music is Jacques Ibert at his best; a lyrical and engaging score beautifully orchestrated.  Escales and Jupiter were recorded in 1954 while Ibert was Director of the Academie de France. The sound is very good mono. The percussion in Valencia seems placed too close to a microphone but, otherwise, the balance is good and there are no distortions.The Chansons de Don Quichotte was part of a film project directed by G. W. Pabst (famous for Pandora’s Box). Unknown to Ibert, the music for the film was a competition between him, Ravel, Milhaud and Delannoy: Ibert was the winner. However, the film was abandoned when funding ran out. A recording of the songs was made in 1933 with Feodor Chailiapin. The texts for the songs (not included with the CD) are poems by Ronsard and Alexandre Arnoux.  Chailiapin was at the end of his career when the songs were recorded but he is in fine voice and sings with real passion. The sound is clear and free from any distortion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OE2XZJMV2L15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DO53#wasThisHelpful","R1OE2XZJMV2L15","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not had a recording of the Rachmaninov Third Symphony for a few years and after reading the reviews at Amazon, decided on the Petrenko.  For me, the attraction is the inclusion of the Caprice bohemien, a colorful early work, (composed during 1892 – 94) based on gypsy themes.  The inspiration for the work was the enchanting Anna Lodyzhenska who was of Gypsy parentage. The Caprice is dedicated to his friend and Anna’s husband Pyotr Lodyzhensky. The young Rachmaninov seems to have been under her spell at the time and would later dedicate his First Symphony to Anna, discreetly using only her initials. The Caprice and First Symphony have in common the heavy use of percussion and orchestral tutti passages. Petrenko and the Royal Liverpool turn is a wonderful performance fully of Gypsy charm.  The orchestral only version of Vocalise comes from Rachmaninov’s middle period and receives a sensitive and lilting performance from the Rpyal Liverpool.Sergei Rachmaninov composed his Third Symphony during 1935-36 at his home in Switzerland and Philadelphia. The symphony has had treated unkindly by some musicologists dismissing it as a failure. Perhaps the reason behind this assessment is that the symphony is a transitional work where the composer continues the sparer style he first adopted in his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. The Symphony was received with mixed emotion by the premiere audience which was probably anticipating the lush sound of his Second Symphony and Second and Third Piano Concerti.Vasily Petrenko and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra deliver a straightforward and elegant performance of the symphony with plenty of energy and pathos.  I do find some of Petrenko’s tempi choices a bit rushed in the first movement and some of the passages poorly phrased. This new recording enters a crowded field of fine recordings that include Leopold Stokowski, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Svetlanov and Mariss Jansons.  The Royal Liverpool may not be the best orchestral but Petrenko gets some fine playing form them. While this is not my most memorable recording of the Third, I will be listening to this performance again.  The sonic are superb and the orchestra is well balanced..","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANYR1T84H6V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063J80UY#wasThisHelpful","RANYR1T84H6V2","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went to see Philomena with a bare outline of the story, expecting a story that would be very sad. Surprisingly, there is much humor in the film, anger about what had been done to Philomena with much understanding and forgiveness.(spoils below)The story of Philomena begins in Ireland in 1952 when she becomes pregnant as a teenager.  Although it is not shown in the film, her family puts her in a convent. At no time are we aware of any feelings on the part of her family toward her. Apparently, she was cast out because of her pregnancy. Philomena must work in the convent for four years, performing backbreaking labor in the convent laundry, seven days a week. Philomena has a son, who she names Anthony and the nuns force her to sign a document relinquishing her parental rights and agree to never attempt to contact her son. Anthony is adopted, along with a girl, by an American couple for a ten hefty fee of $1,000.The story of the film is Philomen’s search for her son fifty years later. She is joined by journalist Martin Sixsmith, who has been forced to resign from his job.  Martin is looking for something to do and agrees to write a book about Philomena’s quest to find her son. The humor of the film comes from the relationship between Martin and Philomena. She loved to read romance novels and recount the plots to Martin, who would is more into Shakespeare. For years, Philomena has visited the convent hoping that she could persuade the nuns to allow her to have the location of her son. The adoption records have been destroyed in a fire but as Martin discovers they were burned by the nuns themselves. The search for her son takes Philomena and Martin to Washington D. C. but, unknown to her, Philomena’s son has been searching for her.(end of spoilers)Comedian Steve Coogan is the driving force behind the film, having read the book by Martin Sixsmith and realized the screen possibilities. Coogan co-authored the screen play with Sixsmith, as well as producing the film and is perfect in portraying Sixsmith on screen. Dame Judy Dench is wonderful as Philomena, portraying her as a strong and determined woman who is strong in her Catholic faith, remaining conflicted over being forced to give up her son. She truly becomes and not plays Philomena. The film is beautifully directed by Stephen Frears with some great cinematography.  When I saw the film, the audience was completely in awe of the film, and everyone sat quietly while the ending credits rolled.  Philomena is one of those films that one thinks about for a long time afterwards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFEGR9YZMGJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSBMNOQ#wasThisHelpful","RRFEGR9YZMGJY","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"York Bowen was a performing musician as well as a composer and was at professional standards on the piano (he was the first pianist to record Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto), viola and French horn. His First Symphony is a student work from 1902. The music is very assured for an 18-year old with beautiful lyrical melodies. The symphony is in three movements, which was innovative for the time and requires a small orchestra. The symphony was not performed during Bowen’s lifetime and had its first in 2010.The First Symphony is not spectacular and one feels that York Bowen is seeking to imitate the styles of older contemporaries.  The music is well orchestrated, Romantic in style, with an individual voice. There is a lovely clarinet solo that opens the second movement and has some interesting melodic interplay between the soloists. The Finale, much like the prior movements, has colorful melodies, beginning with a slow melody and a brisk second subject to conclude: charming but not especially memorable.The Second Symphony was composed in 1909, reverting to the usual four movements, when Bowen was 25 and was first performed in 1912. The music is more assured and mature than the First; it begins with a dramatic motto that leads into an energetic Allegro.  The music is heroic and beautifully developed, and concluding with a powerful chord.  The Lento second movement is gently lyrical with a passionate melody introduced by a horn solo, rising to a climax and returning to the quiet first melody. The Scherzo is magical with an engaging quick-silver melody. The Finale radiates good humor and energy with a triumphant melody that is developed by the orchestra, concluding with a flourish by the full orchestra.Sir Andrew Davis and the BBC Philharmonic turn in terrific performances.  I was more familiar with York Bowen’s piano works and his piano concertos. The Second Symphony is a fabulous work that needs to be performed more often; the first, while it has some great melodies does not have the engagement of the Second.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KCEZ30WVSNGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SVNIH4#wasThisHelpful","R1KCEZ30WVSNGK","AUEHG0DB54B7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUEHG0DB54B7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I generally dislike air fresheners because their scent is usually overpowering and/or merely covers up odors rather than actually eliminating them. Not so with Fresh Wave. This stuff is excellent. First, it has no noticeable scent of its own, which is a huge plus. Second, there's no mess and no reason for the container to be placed in a visible area. The product uses no fans and thus avoids using electricity, something that appeals to my conservation sensibilities.You just open the seal, place the perforated cover back on the jar and then secrete the container in a corner or the bathroom, cellar or other area that warrants freshening.

"There are some interesting insights in this book, which I had hoped to use as a text for a graduate course I teach on marketing sustainable behaviors. Since traditional marketing is about encouraging consumption, it seemed to me that theories of consumption would be a good place to begin an analysis of the possible ways one might conduct ""anti-marketing"" (if you will) campaigns to encourage sustainable consumer behavior. While I believe this idea remains valid, this particular book on consumption is not the best source for such an endeavor.Certainly, author Daniel Miller cannot be held accountable for my failure to accurately assess the contents of his book from the Amazon Vine description. Nor should prospective readers assume, as I did, that the book's content would be presented in the same style as Miller's intriguing website, Stuff. This text does, in fact, provide some useful information about consumption and its drivers, a topic that Miller has researched throughout his career.I found, however, that the format and the organization of the book are wanting in that the chapters appear to be sequenced without much regard to helping readers know where to look for specific topics of interest. One is, apparently, not meant to dip in and out of this volume, but is expected to read it straight through. I find this annoying considering that the book is billed as a presentation of research and should, therefore, have an easy way for readers to isolate particular subjects. In addition, the book opens and closes with an extended, imagined conversation among three characters called Mike, Grace and Chris. I find devices such as this tiresome and wish that Miller had been more straightforward in presenting his theories and laying out his main observations.My final quibble is that Miller uses the consumer culture of Trinidad and shopping patterns in London to illustrate more general points, a technique which seems unnecessarily narrow. He then proceeds to round out his view of consumption by taking just one example of a product -- denim -- and examining why people tend to purchase so much of it. While this is admittedly interesting, it doesn't do much to help readers get a full picture of the drivers of consumption and how our supposed greed for denim translates to our more general greed for everything else.In summary, Consumption and Its Consequences is a good book and worthy of a place on the shelves of academics and serious observers of today's social habits and values. But its title, marketing descriptions and format are unclear and leave something to be desired.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1JQGNRZ8Z4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745661084#wasThisHelpful","R3L1JQGNRZ8Z4C","A31JTKBQRVQ83G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31JTKBQRVQ83G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like author Paul Handstedt, I too found myself living in Hong Kong for an extended period, also in the New Territories working on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Handstedt, however, I went solo, as a faculty member accompanying a small group of graduate students who were doing summer internships in that city. I found Hong Kong to be a cosmopolitan, exciting city with a deeply interesting culture that arose out of its history as a cross-roads of world trade, and therefore of humanity. Thanks to immigration, trade and the Pearl River Delta's new status as the ""workshop of the world,"" Hong Kong has emerged as a prototype of the city of the future. And, its dreadful weather notwithstanding, I loved it.Handstedt's Hong Kong experience was, on the other hand, fraught with worry, nearly all of it caused by the headaches associated with getting his children settled in a foreign environment. Thus, his memoir of Hong Kong felt to me unnecessarily critical of the place and the people. I'm not saying that he was wrong to worry about his kids. If I had children of my own I would probably have worried about mine too. But the constant references to his domestic tragedies -- finding a school, maneuvering a stroller on a city bus -- didn't do much to interest me, nor did I find them particularly humorous.So, I would say that Hong Konged is an OK read, but nothing to go out of one's way for. This is a book that might appeal more to those with children, who can perhaps identify with the author in ways that I could not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3GAV5AW0I32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144054073X#wasThisHelpful","RF3GAV5AW0I32","A31JTKBQRVQ83G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31JTKBQRVQ83G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, I have a friend who has a cottage on a lake and always has a dozen or so people hanging out there on weekends in the warm weather.

"If you don't own any other books on paranormal experiences, including reincarnation, mediumship, apparitions and OBEs, this is a good overview to have on your bookshelf. Author Chris Carter begins this survey in the late 1800s, when the British Society of Physchical Research (and later its spin off the American Society)began to systematically research the claims of spiritualists that they could communicate with the dead. He moves through the 20th century, covering hauntings, dreams, the more recent 'new age' beliefs and figures such as Jane Roberts, who claimed to channel a spirit named Seth who told her what life was like on the other side.Most of the material that Carter includes has been extensively covered elsewhere, but not in a single volume. Some of the paranormal accounts he discusses are quite convincing. One such is the work of a professor at the University of Virginia named Ian Stevenson, whose book ""20 Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation"" is a classic and whose research methods are rigorous and based on the scientific method.Some of the material in this book gives one pause in terms of its credibility. Although no one can prove that life after death exists, there is definitely a good deal of evidence for something that today's science can't account for. Arthur C. Clarke said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Perhaps some of the stories that Carter recounts here are just examples of natural phenomena that our technology does not allow us to understand. That does not, however, make these accounts any less intriguing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMEGDJJPJ7UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594774528#wasThisHelpful","R2DMEGDJJPJ7UU","A31JTKBQRVQ83G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31JTKBQRVQ83G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This account by a physician of his post-death experience differs from most other accounts in several meaningful ways. First, and most important in my view, is that the author presents detailed medical facts about his condition prior to what he asserts was his physical death. He presents convincing evidence that his brain was completely dead and displayed no electrical activity whatsoever. Second, he is absolutely certain that he was indeed dead and his account of his experience includes a great deal of detail that I have never seen in the memoirs of others -- and I have read scores of books on this topic. Finally, unlike many other people who have undergone post- or near-death experiences, Dr. Alexander's medical training and understanding of the human brain makes him a highly credible judge of what actually happened to him. I am not implying that others are not credible; only that this particular author has a degree of knowledge that most others lack and therefore he has more information on which to base his analysis.Whatever you choose to believe, it is quite clear that this doctor experienced some highly unusual phenomena, not just because he claims to have seen 'heaven' but because he was brain dead and then, rather suddenly, revived *with all of his mental functions intact.* Several physicians who attended him are quoted in the book as saying they have no idea how someone in his condition could regain 100% function, but he definitely did. And he has been subjected to entire batteries of medical tests in an effort to ascertain just how his body was able to do this -- all to no avail. Some might call it a miracle. Overall, Dr. Alexander's story is absorbing and a worthwhile read.One more thing to the credit of this book is that it has an excellent bibliography from which interested readers can identify other books on this and similar topics. For me, the question of life after death was not resolved by reading this book, but it did go a good way toward opening up new avenues of inquiry and presenting some ideas that I had not previously considered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KDH3KKLSA37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451695195#wasThisHelpful","R21KDH3KKLSA37","A31JTKBQRVQ83G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31JTKBQRVQ83G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hope I'm not giving too much away when I say that ""kill"" as in ""Kill the Boy Band"" is used in both senses, and it explores the scenario: What would you do if your friends kidnapped and held the least popular (think Ringo) member of your favorite boy band hostage? This is more original than the popular: ""What would you do if two guys were insanely in love with you, and they both had superpowers?"" theme in young adult lit, so I was interested in reading this. This book is quite dark, and there are flaws, but at least the premise is one I have not read about before in this genre.The narrator, who I will call N (not to be snarky, but because she is nameless), is a teen fan of a Brit boy band called ""The Ruperts,"" (so called because the four members all share the first name). The Ruperts formed as the result of a reality TV show and has the requisite members: one talented one, one dim but hunky one, etc. N's popular best friend from school, Erin, is also a fan, though she keeps that side of her secret with everyone but N. They have two other friends/fans, with whom they mostly interact online: Apple, a wealthy Third-World orphan with body issues, and Isabel, who lives to post foul-mouthed tweets and update her website with Ruperts' gossip. When the book opens, the girls have managed to get a room at the NY hotel where the band is staying to perform a concert. The hostage situation happens unexpectedly, and by the end of the evening, Twitter has exploded, and the girls have a rather big problem on their hands.As mentioned, this is a dark read, and the ending is less than happy.  N. repeatedly claims that the secret of a boy band's success is that they make fans happy, but these four girls seemed anything but.  I enjoyed the running joke of N. giving fake names from popular eighties' movies whenever she met someone, but I found the lack of character development to be frustrating. Each girl seemed to have an equally valid motive for the crime, but none of them seemed sympathetic enough for me to be on their side throughout the book.  Overall, it was an interesting premise but a disappointing execution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DR3OFMHWBE19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545867479#wasThisHelpful","R1DR3OFMHWBE19","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, let me see if I have at least some of the rules straight of ""Fae World,"" or Aurora, from where two teen brothers, Callum and Judah, arrive and promptly form a love triangle with a Californian boarding school girl named Noa (no one in this book has a normal name even the Earthlings) in ""Shattered Blue.""1. The Fae (fairy folk) are each known by a color (such as Red Son), which corresponds to a superpower. The Clear Fae were long thought to have no powers whatsoever, but this turned out to be false. When they discovered they were being so brainwashed, they unsurprisingly rebel, and currently, there is tension between the groups. The brothers' family is right in the midst of the turmoil.2. There is a Portal between the world of Aurora and our reality. Or maybe several. This book answers the question: What happens when a Gatekeeper is hurled through his own Portal? The Portal has an appetite and needs to be fed on a regular basis with humans (of either world), in order to ensure that the Auroran visitors can keep staying in our world. The Portal is guarded by a man who appears to be the gardener at Noa's school but who is magic.3. There is a character who is actually from Aurora, but for some reason, no one figures this out until the end when they are told directly. This character's life is then put at risk, and this is the cliffhanger the first book ends on.When the first volume of this trilogy) opens, Noa is reeling from the loss of her older sister, Isla, who died in a freak accident saving Noa's life. Her parents, especially her mother, Hannah, a travel writer, are depressed and absorbed in their own issues; it's left to Noa to care for her spunky toddler sister, Sasha. But soon she has more to distract her, when two brothers with Fae powers arrive, and need her help to overcome their feud. There are betrayals, misunderstandings, two evil Fae folk who work as strippers, a homecoming float, and more.Overall: This author certainly has a jaw-dropping imagination - I would need to read ""Shattered Blue"" twice in order to get every aspect of the world-building straight.  However, I found the main ""action"" seemed to come out of nowhere, and I wasn't too fond of the insta-love, particularly since we don't learn much about Callum before they're deeply involved.  On the other hand, I would likely have enjoyed all the melodrama if I'd read this book as a teen, so my combined rating is four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A65Q8XN2EAHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503949974#wasThisHelpful","R3A65Q8XN2EAHK","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Bella becomes a widow, is laid off from her job as a science teacher, and runs out of other options, she packs her five-year-old son, Max, into their car and prepares to drive to her mother-in-law's home, though she has never been close to her. But when a series of coincidences, including a double spotting of a pregnant cat (who they wind up adopting), plus a billboard that turns out to advertise a place that doesn't exist in reality, the two end up taking a detour to Lily Dale, a town in New York State which is full of psychics and other New Age gurus, in which such things as ghosts are taken seriously. To her surprise, Bella winds up getting a job managing the hotel she first stays at, as its owner has recently passed (but it's believed that she was drowned). The proprietor, Odelia, who gives her the job seems not to believe Bella when she insists she is only staying temporarily, and indeed events seem to be conspiring to keep her in Lily Dale. Soon a whole cast of quirky characters are queuing up to befriend and assist Bella, but when a private investigator arrives and starts digging into the case,, Bella realizes she may be in the midst of a mystery - and in the presence of the perp. Is the killer one of the seemingly friendly souls who live in Lily Dale, or perhaps a tourist? Whoever it is, time is running out.I wasn't familiar with this mystery series, and so I first thought ""A Lily Dale Mystery"" referred to the main detective.  I liked it much better than the first Wendy Corsi Staub book I read (A Perfect Stranger).  Overall, though the pacing got bogged down in the middle of the book, I enjoyed discovering Lily Dale, its cast of oddballs, and Bella herself, who finds that sensing ghosts just may bring a final connection to her deceased husband.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJQPSN32LCXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532487#wasThisHelpful","R3SJQPSN32LCXE","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eve's son, Tyler, was born with a genetic condition that leaves him hyper-sensitive to light, in which an excess of the wrong kind could leave him disabled or even dead. Since his diagnosis, his mom has devoted her life to trying to make Tyler's life as ""ordinary"" as possible, even if it means shortchanging her husband, David, and mercurial older daughter, Melissa. (This set-up will be familiar to any fan of Jodi Picoult, but the author does provide some twists of her own.) When ""The Deepest Secret"" opens, Eve is managing all right, but when their neighbor, Amy, an eleven-year-old, goes missing and later turns up dead, a wide net of suspicion is cast upon the neighborhood residents, many of whom have known each other for years. This affects each of the four family members in different ways: David comes to realize the extent of how Eve has excluded him in caring for their son; Melissa is absorbed with adolescent issues that may or may not be tied to the mystery; Tyler stays busy scouting the neighborhood under the guise of taking photos at night; and Eve herself, is attempting to cover up her role in Amy's disappearance, even if it means lying to her distraught friend. Along with Tyler, we come to realize that just about everyone in this book is hiding something, but whether it's of a nature that the police would be interested in tying to this case is another story.""The Deepest Secret,"" definitely puts a new slant on the standard missing-person-throws-otherwise-placid-neighborhood-in-uproar plot, with its exploration of how Tyler's condition affects the family dynamics. In addition, the author does scatter red herrings liberally about, but because many of the secondary characters are undeveloped (I had difficulty keeping them all straight), it is difficult to care about the more peripheral ones. But as the reader learns who the perp is early on in the story, the tension revolves around whether or not he will willingly come forward and confess. Though the reasons this is delayed are inexcusable, it still makes sense for this character.  Overall, it would have been better if it had been more tightly focused, but it is still an absorbing read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUN5LZTMZG1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393731#wasThisHelpful","R1QUN5LZTMZG1I","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A Line of Blood,"" achieves what all good book titles should aim for: multiple meanings.  ""Blood"" refers to heritage (one of the main characters, Max, is the only son of Alex Mercer, who's also an only son, etc.), and also to the fact that Alex and Max stumble upon a crime scene in the first pages.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book is mediocre and not framed as a mystery at all.One morning chasing their cat, Alex and Max discover their neighbor, Bryce, at his home in what looks like suicide, but the police decide to probe further.  It turns out that Alex's wife, Millicent, may or may not have been involved with Bryce, and so both adults become suspects.  There aren't many other suspects in the book; the main one being their elderly neighbor, Mr. Ashani, who Alex has never cared for.  As the investigation is carried out, the reader learns of the secrets and past trauma in the Mercer family, which includes infidelity, SID and indiscreet journal writings/drawings.  When the book opens, the couple is managing all right, but the murder begins to bring problems they had suppressed to light again.  They must also deal with the effect on Max, but it may be that getting him professional help is not nearly enough.  Will the Mercer family be able to hold it together during this time, and perhaps even manage to cover up each other's actions.The book does not really focus on whodunit; instead it looks at the various sins of the past for both Alex and Millicent and examines how the present stress has a negative impact on their family.  There is a lot of dialogue that is more like banter, which is not surprising when you learn that the author is also a TV producer.  Just about everyone curses freely, including the child, which is sometimes intended as being ""affectionate"" and other times hostile. (Multiple times, the child refers to his mother as a term rhyming with ""brother-tucker,"" and he also adds endearments that rhyme with ""witch"" and ""shunt."")  I did not care for any of the main characters (and yes, partly because of their language), and found myself skimming as I progressed through the story.  I also thought one plot point, in which they do something expressly forbidden by the detectives to be unrealistic. By the end, I was thoroughly tired of the characters, their banter and their problems, though how it was resolved was a surprise to me and not a traditional mystery-type ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KWTTTREU0G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062406108#wasThisHelpful","R19KWTTTREU0G5","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Eden is assaulted by her older brother's best friend, Kevin, (several hours after playing a game of Monopoly), she's understandably conflicted and unsure of whether to report it, particularly since he has threatened her to keep silent. And although she is angry at her parents for not protecting her and her brother for continuing to (unknowingly) socialize with a rapist, Eden cannot explain the reason for her personality changes in the aftermath to them. Formerly, a good student and member of the school band, Eden, along with her best friend Mara, begins to experiment with boys, alcohol, partying and drugs, which continues up through their senior year (the novel spans Eden's whole high school career). Her reputation at school becomes compromised, thanks in part to Kevin's younger sister, who is inexplicably hostile toward Eden. Feeling she has nothing left to lose, Eden begins a pattern of attracting/confusing/repelling the boys with whom she becomes involved.  But when another girl makes accusations against Kevin, will Eden find the courage to speak out and expose the truth?At first, I was drawn into Eden's story, finding the style of the narrative appropriate to her fragile emotional state in the aftermath of the rape.  I also found her reactions to be realistic, even when she couldn't bring herself to tell anyone close to her.  But I found the story arc to be disjointed - situations were set up, promising further development, then dropped.  Also, an entire book where the main character does nothing but party and have sex (this is a judgment from the viewpoint of a reader, not a moral one), becomes dull, especially since Eden repeats the same pattern over and over.  Characters (of any age) without any kinds of meaningful interests that they care enough about to pursue seriously are boring to me, even if the author provides a reason for why this is so.  Overall, I do think the topic of sexual violence against young women deserves public attention, but this was not an engaging way to go about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JXSAW12IVLNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481449354#wasThisHelpful","R1JXSAW12IVLNN","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're familiar with the outline of Steve Jobs' life, you already know how this movie will unfold, and if you don't, what you'll mainly take away is that Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) was a huge jerk to a lot of people, had a gift for alienating everyone around him, but somehow managed to get it together to pull off several major product launches without a hitch, at which he was treated like dirt by those who knew him (in his view), and like a god by those in the audience. Almost all the confrontations take place backstage in this movie, and it's like ""A Christmas Carol,"": all the major players in Jobs' life take turns showing him how much better their lives would have been had he been decent to them, but then they also acknowledge that he is right, or at least is the most stubborn guy in the room. Pretty much every scene is a variation on the following:Michael Fassbender: I want a Golden Goose. Get me a Golden Goose!Other person: Michael, you may be a genius, but I've got a high IQ, too, and I'm not going to let you intimidate me.Michael Fassbender: I don't care how, I want it NOW!Other person: Oh, okay, if you really insist.Michael Fassbender: And a cream feast...""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" jokes aside, I have a feeling the director (Danny Boyle) was quite adamant that the secondary characters not kowtow to Michael's character, but get right in his face and yell/bicker/curse/shoot zingers back. This includes Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak, Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld, and Katherine Waterston as Chrisanne Brennan, all of whom do an excellent job.  (The three actresses who play Jobs' daughter, Lisa, at various ages, are also impressive.) Most of the dialogue is very clever, which is good, but most is also delivered at a volume more appropriate for an outdoor sporting event, which may trigger a migraine, if you're prone to them.  Several scenes take place concurrently with a flashback scene, so you get two arguments going on at the same time.  The extras in the hallways mostly stand around fidgeting with props and trying not to look like they're eavesdropping, which is pretty much impossible, and the extras in the audience get to drum their feet and pump their fists a lot.  We learn about Jobs' adoption history, too, and how it affects him, but most of the movie is people displaying their gifts for verbal repartee.  If this is the kind of thing you like, you should enjoy the movie, but I do recommend for migraine-prone people bringing their medication of choice with them to the theater.  Just in case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15E9OW3SA70T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016C9WTP6#wasThisHelpful","R15E9OW3SA70T9","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scarlett Epstein's life has totally ended: her favorite TV show ""Lycanthrope High"" has been cancelled, meaning she no longer has a fresh source of inspiration for her fan fiction, though she's a well-regarded writer in that community. Her offline world seems weary, flat, stale and unprofitable: she's forced to attend a mediocre New Jersey public school; her stressed single mom, Dawn, is more like a girlfriend than a mature influence; and her former friend, Gideon, has become part of the popular clique and is dating her worst enemy. She doesn't get much sympathy from her best friend, Avery, either, who encourages her to focus on real people, not TV characters, for a change. Her online fellow writers are also heartbroken, but what can they do, except decide to start writing fics with some original characters but still based on the show. Little does Scarlett suspect that her latest foray into fan fiction will wind up being the catalyst for her to further upset her nemesis, perplex and confuse Gideon, as she tries to figure out her feelings for him, and challenge her to start participating in the offline world, rather than sitting back and caustically judging it.There are occasional hilarious insights in this novel, such as when Scarlett observes that on Halloween her peers act like those idiotic teens the detectives always think did it at the beginning of ""Law and Order."" However, just as Scarlett's online community calls her to task for inserting a ""Mary Sue"" character into her stories, several of her own character traits struck me as rather ""Sue-ish."" She's extremely judgmental and in my opinion, mostly gets away with doing and saying hurtful things to her family, friends and peers. (The way the storyline with her father was resolved struck me as unrealistic.) Also, although she describes herself as poor, unattractive, and frumpy, it turns out that all she has to do is blow out her hair and don a tight red dress to get people to notice her; even the most popular girl in school tells her that she's attractive. So although I gave the book points for not being afraid to feature an average-looking teen heroine without a designer wardrobe, I had to wind up subtracting them.Overall, I thought the story Scarlett wrote online (which is posted in full) was tighter plotted than the actual novel.  Teens in young adult fiction used to actually map out and execute plans in order to snare the attractive remote member of the opposite sex; now, it seems, they just wander from scene to scene before the author finally decides for whatever reasons, to put them together.  But maybe the target audience will enjoy it more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXSY0MH4W6KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148353#wasThisHelpful","R1OXSY0MH4W6KY","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Coach: Can he still play?Trainer: He's in a coma!The Coach: Answer the question! - ""Not Another Teen Movie""I have never been a football fan (warning: reviewer bias), and I don't know much about physics, anatomy or neuroscience, but the idea that lasting damage to the brain can occur if one person keeps banging his helmeted head against another person's helmet repeatedly has never struck me as implausible: heads tend to be soft and vulnerable, even inside a padded container, and probably not designed to take that kind of punishment with impunity. Males of several species have been known to engage in head butting, but the human race is the only one which actually pays money to watch this spectacle. I don't know about the long-term effects of this practice on other animals, but ""Concussion,"" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, makes it clear that there is a correlation between a professional football career and brain damage/dementia in men.  Thanks to a Nigerian doctor and forensic pathologist, Bennet Omalu, who first pinpointed this condition, and several other people, profiled in ""Concussion,"" this is now starting to be acknowledged, though not without struggle.Dr. Omalu had the opportunity to study former Steelers player, Mike Webster's, brain and perform an autopsy on it.  Because Webster had displayed very public erratic and explosive behavior with his family, friends and associates before his death, Dr. Omalu was curious to see if the slides taken revealed anything similar to the deterioration shown in Alzheimer's patients.  He discovered something called tau tangles on Webster's slides, which had not been spotted before, but which helped explain how a man who had once had a career, eventually became unemployable, broke and alienated from those he knew.  The kind of man who wasn't shy about telling a colleague that his shirt could use more starch (without malice), Dr. Omalu was initially stunned to discover the reaction of the NFL, a ten billion dollar a year, tax-exempt, non-profit organization, which was displeased and took many steps to discredit him.  Eventually, Dr. Omalu was made to testify in a court case against his former boss, concerning an FBI investigation into their lab.  And because of his research, other families of NFL players have come forward to bring lawsuits against the NFL for downplaying, if not denying, the long-term effects of concussion..Clearly, this can be framed as a David vs. Goliath type narrative, but it's also the story of a man whose own struggle with depression led to his interest in studying the brains of those who had committed suicide, and who eventually overcame it to go on to discover something unique, even if he was, at times, sidelined unfairly.  At any rate, let's hope both the upcoming film about this topic and this book (on which the film is based) are a catalyst to more people having, as Laskas puts it, ""the conversation America does not want to have.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BLJP8QY6D6HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812987578#wasThisHelpful","R1BLJP8QY6D6HL","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Parker Grant, the protagonist of ""Not If I See You First,"" is a somewhat cynical, fiercely independent teen who also happens to be blind. In true young adult novel tradition, she's lost both her parents tragically: her mom in the accident that blinded Parker, and her (loving but possibly pill-addicted father) in an accident that might or might not have been suicide. Since her dad died, Parker's aunt and uncle (with her two cousins) have moved into her home, which she resents (they cramp her style by trying to over-protect her), and she has just started a new year of high school with a group of new students unfamiliar with her ""Rules."" Plus she has to train a new guide, and is dealing with a former boyfriend who hurt her badly, (with the kind of thoughtless prank teen boys are prone to with an added layer of injury because of her disability)  but who seems to want her to give him a second chance. Complicating things further is the guy who helped her in the shoe store, who seems to be interested. And the school coach has spotted Parker's private runs and wants her to go out for track.  Even if she doesn't want to admit it, it will take the help of her friends, both new and old, to help her through this.As I read, I kept jumping the gun, believing I knew where the story was headed.  At first, I thought that Parker's conflict would be figuring out what happened to her father and coming to terms with it, and then I thought it was going to be focusing on Parker running track and dealing with challenges there.  Instead, these two potential storylines are dropped abruptly, in order to focus on Parker's drama with her two love interests.  And there is a lot of drama, and yes, the main character is a young teenage girl, but I would have appreciated not quite so much at so high a pitch.  Still, when the focus is on Parker and her relationships with her friends and cousins, things stay interesting, as well as when the track storyline is re-introduced and resolved.  Sometimes the main character comes across as self-centered and selfish, but again, you can see the reasons for this.  Finally, assuming the author is not visually impaired, this book must have taken a lot of research in order to so accurately portray a character who is blind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BDHKW99F0VQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316259853#wasThisHelpful","R3BDHKW99F0VQY","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw this movie mostly because I was a fan of the original ""Vacation"" franchise starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, even if some of the humor went over my head as a kid (like Cousin Vicki hauling out her stash of marijuana).  I also figured the critics were being overly harsh by panning it, perhaps applying too high standards to what was intended as simply a fun summer comedy.I was wrong.  Oh well, at least it was two hours in an air-conditioned theater.Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold, who is now an airline pilot.  He loves his family just like Chevy did in the original but is currently feeling disconnected from them.  His wife, unbeknownst to him is reading sell-help tomes, and the two sons, who can't stand each other, also don't really respect him (and given his response in an opening scene to mediating a spat, it's no wonder).  Rather than return to a summer cabin where they've gone for years, Ed decides to take his family on a cross-country jaunt to Walley World, the destination of the original ""Vacation"" movie.  Fans of the original know that that trip didn't turn out so well, and the same holds true for the new generation of Griswolds.  All the big screen road trip clichés are on full display here, as the family lurches from one disaster to another.  Will they make it to the amusement park intact and in good enough shape to enjoy the roller-coaster?  You probably already know the answer.This movie is rated ""R"" and for a good reason.  Most of the cursing is done by the youngest, preteen son (Steele Stebbins).  Other characters don't have quite his affinity for four-letter words, but they are the victims of a number of gross gags featuring, among other things, pubic hair and human waste.  If that sounds like fun, you might be pleased to discover that there's also jokes about rim jobs, a pedophile truck driver and a dead cow.  There are a couple of good performances by supporting actors, including Charlie Day playing a suicidal white water rafting guide and Chris Hemsworth as the adult Audrey's well-endowed husband, as well as cameos by Chevy and Beverly, but overall, unless you're craving some serious vulgar humor, I'd recommend skipping this ""Vacation.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBOTD4855P6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Y4JDH0#wasThisHelpful","RBBOTD4855P6X","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Bradstreet Gate"" features three Harvard students who were tangentially involved in a murder case, in which a popular professor was the main suspect, even years later. Georgia is a bohemian type, and the daughter of a photographer who featured her in a risqué exhibit (and subsequently got in trouble).  Alice is of Serbian descent and is a caustic would-be journalist from a troubled home.  Charlie, a working class student with political aspirations, is the third of the trio, who later goes into the cyber-security field post 9-11.  The characters' reactions to the professor in question range from admiration to contempt, which changes over the course of the novel.  ""Bradstreet Gate"" follows the characters into their post-graduation world, where they deal with personal and professional conflicts. And when a memorial tribute is arranged for the anniversary of the victim's death, more info on the case is discovered, changing their lives yet again.This book turned out to be not what I was expecting.  Each main character has a potentially interesting story and path of character development, but I found the novel's structure made it difficult to keep track of what was going on in the present.  Certain events - like one character finding a serious love interest - are dropped into the narrative casually, which made me wonder if I'd missed something earlier.  It also didn't seem like anything was seriously at stake for any of the three; the troubles in their lives post-college did not seem to be caused by the crime.  Overall, it does a good job of bringing Harvard and its atmosphere to life, but was ultimately disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U9BVYLRRKSCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139318#wasThisHelpful","R2U9BVYLRRKSCP","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Rebecca, a single mom who's raising the adolescent daughter of her deceased best friend, receives a call from her school claiming that her daughter, Callie, was caught bullying a classmate, her response is that her child would never be capable of such behavior.  As the story develops, the reader learns (to no great surprise) that the reality is more complex than that.  While dealing with this issue, Rebecca is reminded of her own youth and the cruelties, both intentional and otherwise, that she and her friend caused another girl.  Rebecca also remembers a teenage girl whose body was found but the cause of her death left unsolved.  When Callie's behavior starts to turn baffling, Rebecca isn't sure how to proceed, but decides that it's a former friend of Callie's who is causing the problem.  Compounding this is the fact that both Calile's parents died violently, and Callie is beginning to question this.  The reader does ultimately get Callie's firsthand viewpoint, showing that the boundaries between bully and victim are far more fluid than the adults around them realize, and that Callie may well be in more trouble than she can handle.Like Judy Blume's book on middle school bullying, ""Blubber,"" we see the main character morph from a bystander to a bully, encouraged by her two friends, and then ultimately a victim, after she decides to take a stand.  If I remember correctly, Blume even titles a chapter, ""I can't believe my class would do such a thing,"" which is pretty much the same reaction that Callie's school and Rebecca maintains for most of the book.  I felt the story really began to shine once Callie's account began and that it would have been a better book if it was told more from her viewpoint, but obviously that wasn't what the author was trying to do.  ""Hyacinth Girls,"" like many recent novels on bullying does a good job of making it clear that though the means to bully have been greatly updated, some of the same causes (lack of communication, peer pressure) are still very much around and need addressing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTL6IQBBQ8JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341805X#wasThisHelpful","R1DTL6IQBBQ8JM","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I first saw him in ""October Sky,"" I would be willing to watch just about any movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal (though I draw the line at ""Bubble Boy"").  Here he plays the heavily symbolically named Billy Hope, an orphan from Hell's Kitchen who, through the help of his youthful love Rachel McAdams, precocious daughter (Oona Laurence) and sheer grit and determination, becomes a champion (and extremely wealthy) boxer.  The only trouble is his wife wants him to ease up to ensure he'll still be around and functional in the future.  But when he's taunted by a rival, and he ignores (as usual) the advice to ""just walk away,"" tragedy occurs, and in a span of a few weeks - a timeline that would be amusing if it wasn't presented so grimly, Billy loses not only his wife, but his assets, his sponsorship, his daughter (who is taken into Child Protective Services), and hits rock bottom.  Luckily, Forest Whitaker appears as a mentor and owner of a run-down gym, who also coaches disadvantaged youths.  In another implausible timeline, Billy swallows his pride, trains hard and turns his life back around in about a month and a half.  No cliché of sports movies is left unmined here, though the entire cast does a fantastic job, making me feel sorry for everyone involved.The lead actor's performance cannot be faulted, either in the way he's physically transformed himself or the way he manages to convey real emotion even though the plot holds no surprises.  Billy Hope isn't always a likeable character, but I found myself rooting for him anyway, even though I knew exactly how the movie would end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2170GIRP2ZU1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FJ3096#wasThisHelpful","R2170GIRP2ZU1K","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Proof of Forever,"" begins when its four main characters: tomboyish, sci-fi fan Zoe; A-list Tali; straight-A Luce and optimistic Joy of the mysterious secret reunite at a summer camp reunion.  They've long since drifted apart and are more concerned with their own romance and family issues than each other's.  However, when they are all flung back in time two years ago to a particular summer at camp, it seems like their only chance to getting back to the future is to repeat a photo shoot at the end of the week.  Now the girls must deal with such issues as the loss of well-developed breasts (really), the possibility that one of their parent's is having an affair, as well as love interests who may or may not be the ones they remember ending up with in the present.  As their fateful day approaches, each girl must figure out who she is and what kind of person she wants to be with.This book had an interesting premise, and I wanted to like it more than I did.  I really liked Zoe's and Joy's sections, but I couldn't really sympathize with Tali and Luce.  I also felt the pace dragged a bit, and there were many characters mentioned briefly as if the reader was supposed to know who they were but who never appeared again.

"Kit Ward, protagonist of ""Dear Killer,"" is a seventeen-year-old seemingly normal high school student who also happens to be a serial killer.  Trained by her mother in the art of assassination since she was little (luckily dear old dad is oblivious), she lives by a philosophy of moral nihilism, which will be gradually challenged over the course of the book.  After receiving a letter (she communicates with those who hire her by snail mail) targeting a classmate, she winds up befriending one and killing another, which helps put the police on the trail of ""The Perfect Killer,"" the moniker she goes by.  Kit also develops feelings for Alec, the detective assigned to solving that case and begins to question everything her mother has instilled in her about their unorthodox lifestyle.  When it looks like the authorities may be closing in on her trail, Kit must decide whether to escape or face the consequences of her actions.The author is a gifted writer, however, there are flaws in this novel which caused my rating to go down.  First, the protagonist does not use typical Brit idioms for things, which is jarring because the setting is London (perhaps to evoke similarities to Jack the Ripper).  For example, she calls her mother ""Mom,"" not ""Mum.""  (Probably comparing the author to Elizabeth George, an American mystery author whose characters always sound authentically British is unfair, but she's proof that research pays off.)Secondly, as noted by many reviewers, there are too many implausible scenarios.  Plots with more holes than Swiss cheese can still be fun (example: Gone Girl), but too many things required a suspension of disbelief, particularly the fact that a detective in charge of such an important case would spend so much time socializing with a teenager (and a female one) at that.  Not very professional, although he's presented as a sympathetic character.

"Warning: This review contains spoilers.When Aspen Matis sent off on the Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from Mexico to Canada, she hoped to recover from the trauma of being sexually assaulted her first week at college, and also prove to her overprotective parents (and herself) that she could truly be independent. After her college dealt poorly with the aftermath of the rape (though that would not be the end of it), Aspen decided to rekindle a recently discovered love of hiking in the wilderness, and armed with a few items of clothing, a backpack and a GPS navigator (which her parents insisted on), she set forth. On the way, she would face various challenges, including running out of water and food, struggling through snow shod just in running shoes, and catching a nearly fatal disease. She would also deal with sexism from some of her fellow hikers (which make up about eighty-five percent of the thru-hikers). As a child, Aspen had been dressed by her mother and frightened to go places on her own, but by the end, she became a young woman who wasn't afraid to step over rattlesnakes and past nearby bears, make trips solo in harsh conditions, and even find a man who would eventually become her husband.Oh how I wanted to love this book. From the description, I pictured it as a kind of feminist manifesto. However, the reality (and I suppose the author can't be blamed for how it's packaged) was quite different. The author is a gifted writer when it comes to conveying the natural environment of her journey. The setting springs to life through her vivid prose, and if the rest matched that, this would easily be a five star review. However, the personal parts often read like diary entries, the dialogue is littered with four-letter words, and the ending struck me as sugar-coated, especially with what you learn in the acknowledgements. I admired the author for how she donated to RAINN and returned to Colorado College on their invitation to speak about the rape.  I'm glad she went on to have a successful life, both professionally as a writer and personally.  However, as a narrator, I felt that while Aspen was very honest about her relationship with her parents, she often failed to realize just how her behavior impacted her fellow hikers on the trail.  There were a lot of minor things in the book that felt glossed over or omitted in order to make the narrator appear more of a victim (and I'm not talking about the rape).  (Yes, I had tons of questions.  What kind of father just lets this kind of behavior go on with his wife without any intervention?  And even without help from one's parents, kids get a lot of info about such things as ""stranger danger"" from school, other adults and pop culture.  How is it possible in this day and age to be a vulnerable single woman and willingly get into a car driven by a strange man, especially after having been raped?)  This isn't meant to come off as blaming the victim, but I found the narrator's constant lack of basic common sense made it hard to always sympathize with her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OU5X85SZH25A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R3OU5X85SZH25A","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Reading the Comments"" is a thought-provoking look behind the online reviews, likes, Facebook updates, tweets, etc. that there is controversy over whether or not to read in the first place.  In engaging in what author Joseph M. Reagle Jr. calls, ""the users' search for serendipity,"" the best and worst of human nature is evident. This book examines how online platforms for expression adapt (or fail to) as their popularity grows, and how popularity makes it more likely that they will attract bullies and spammers forcing them to take on new directions if they wish to survive.Among other topics, Reagle examines the intentions and effects of comments, how product reviews are susceptible to manipulation and fakery, how cyber-bullying at places like Goodreads can be addressed, how content and ratings cause us to define ourselves (there's an amusing theory floated that Facebook popularity may be causing an increase in facial surgery), how reviewing causes tension between public input and expert opinion, and just what constitutes ""constructive criticism.""  He also looks at the role the Internet plays in shaming public figures and the excuses they offer for damage control.  Social networking, as Reagle notes, occurred in the pre-Internet era, and some of the same issues are still relevant now.Overall, this book is not at all dry, and some parts, like the ones on Amazon reviews, are very funny.  (As an Amazon reviewer, I must state that I'm not receiving any bribes to put that in here, nor does my rating mean that I am a family member, friend or the author himself reviewing his book.)

We also learn that her mother, a high powered lawyer who always seemed to disapprove of Stevie's weight, moved out several years ago, and Stevie's only friend from home (besides her brother Josh) is the charismatic, college-aged Eden, who Stevie meets in a writing seminar and who introduces Stevie to the joys of alcohol, partying and eventually, sex.  Fortunately, for our protagonist, she has a therapist straight out of a young adult novel, who is willing to go the extra mile with her and help her take the first steps toward recovery - even if it is going to take awhile.Pros: Stevie's voice struck me as authentically teenaged: snarky, yet also yearning for acceptance beneath the tough veneer.  My favorite line was when she describes taking a morning trail ride with her therapist and notes, ""We're practically a tampon commercial.""Cons: The novel's plot seemed formulaic, and there wasn't much to set it apart from other similar young adult ""problem"" novels.Overall: A good read if you're interested in how eating disorders affect young women, with some very funny lines along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZR0EK43T7RSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006233574X#wasThisHelpful","R1ZR0EK43T7RSY","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Devil in Jerusalem"" can be described as ""A Child Called It"" by way of ""Law and Order.""  It begins with two young children admitted to the hospital ER, one unconscious, both obviously the victims of severe abuse.  Their mother, Daniella, refuses to admit this possibility and plays dumb when questioned by the two detectives assigned to investigate this case.  Detective Bina, herself a mother, is disgusted and horrified, a reaction the reader almost certainly will share, as more details emerge, and it appears that Daniella and her husband, after moving to Jerusalem, have gotten involved with a charismatic and amoral (is there any other kind?) cult leader who has primary control over disciplining their children ranging in age from a toddler to teenagers.  Both Daniella and her husband are separated from their families, struggling financially and personally, and thus are easy marks for being seduced by this man.  Much space is also given to the backstory, beginning when Daniella herself is in college but must give up her dreams of being a doctor to have her first child.  Crucial to punishing the leader and his flunkies is testimony from the children themselves, but will they be able to detach themselves from their harsh treatment and tell the truth?The subject matter is undeniably grim, though that is not the main reason for my rating.  It is likely that the reader, upon reaching the part where graphic abuse is described, may share the reaction of one detective and feel nauseous.  The descriptions are brutal to read, as just about form of abuse is perpetrated on these innocent victims without anyone intervening for a long time.  If the author set out to shock, disgust and horrify the reader thoroughly, she has more than achieved her goal.The writing quality itself, however, is uneven.  There is much showing instead of telling, as well as some purple prose.  I was surprised to learn that this wasn't the author's first or second book, as those kinds of mistakes are more common (and forgivable) then.  Overall, it does take an unflinching look at a difficult subject, but flaws in the execution keep it from being as powerful as it could be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJA5S8960KDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043131#wasThisHelpful","RRJA5S8960KDR","A27OBJA1YDQFZI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27OBJA1YDQFZI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first security/cloud camera. We have an unstable neighbor who occasionally acts up and wanders into other people's yards, so I was in need of something like this.I *thought* setup was going to be pretty easy and I do consider myself tech savvy. I scanned the QR code and downloaded the app from the app store, plugged the camera in to a power source and connected it via ethernet to our router. The app located the camera and registered it. It then asked me if I wanted to use the camera wirelessly, which I did, so I selected that option. It then said I could unplug the ethernet cable and use it wirelessly. However, every time I unplugged the ethernet cable, I could not view the camera at all via the iPhone app.I tried several things including resetting the camera, refreshing our wireless router, refreshing the camera itself and deleting the camera altogether via the mobile app and setting it up again. After a day or so, I could not even get it to connect to our wireless network at all (would say network not available or incorrect password - neither of which were true), so I just left it cabled in, which meant I could not place the camera where I needed it to be.I went to TP Link's website and started reading. I also contacted technical support. There is a support page (here: http://www.tp-link.com/en/download/NC200.html) for this model, the NC200. There are things like firmware updates (though they don't tell you how to install/apply them), manuals (though there are three listed, they don't really tell you the difference between them - the names are ambiguous), a web plugin (that does not work on either browser I have - Chrome and IE) and Management Utility, which, as it turns out, is the desktop/laptop program.The manuals are as follows (found on the NP200's support page):* NC200_Camera_Control_V1_UG This is the user guide for the Camera Control program. The Camera Control program is the desktop program. The TP-LINK Camera Control is a software for you to conveniently view and control multiple TP-LINK IP cameras on a single computer screen.* NC200_V1_UG - This is user guide for the camera itself - the NC200. This covers about everything you need to know about the camera including how to set up, the web management tool, mounting the camera, how to set up motion detection and notification sending. This is a fairly technical user guide, but it's worth reading if you really want to understand how to use all the features of this camera.* NC200_V1_QIG - This is the Quick Installation Guide. Same as the little brochure you get inside the box.Through some sort of magic or wizardry, I *finally* got this thing to connect to my wireless network and when I unplugged the ethernet, IT WORKED. While I was waiting for support to respond, I downloaded and installed the desktop program (found under the Management Utility tab on the NC200's support page) and also logged into the camera's admin program via my browser (by putting the IP address of the camera in the browser). Don't ask me how I found the IP address of the camera (update: it can be found when you run the Setup Wizard), but when you do, and you visit that page, BOOKMARK IT.So, with one of those programs (the Setup Wizard program or the web management page), I finally got it going. What's annoying to me is that the included documentation doesn't really tell you about these two programs. I had to hunt to find them and the less than tech-savvy will be totally lost.There are two ways to setup your camera:* The app for your smartphone - there is both an Android and Apple app which can be found in their respective app stores.* The program called ""Setup Wizard"" that can be found under the ""Setup Wizard"" tab on the NC200's support page.There are several programs you can use to view your camera, tweak settings and manage your camera (and out of the box, TP Link does not do a good job of explaining these programs, what they are and where to find them):* The program for your desktop called ""Camera Control"": The TP-LINK Camera Control is a software for you to conveniently view and control multiple TP-LINK IP cameras on a single computer screen. This can be downloaded via the NC 200's support page under the ""Management Utility"" tab.* The app for your smartphone - there is both an Android and Apple app which can be found in their respective app stores.* The web management page. You get to this by typing in the IP address of your camera into a web browser.* www.tplinkcloud.com -  In order to use this, you will likely have to download a plugin after signing up for a TP Link cloud account. The web plugin can be found on the NP200's support page under the ""Web Plugin"" tab. Then, once you have created a cloud account with TP link, you can go to www.tplinkcloud.com, log in and view you camera from anywhere. However, as of this writing, I could not view my camera through either the Chrome, Internet Explorer 11 or Edge. So, the ""cloud"" part of this cloud camera doesn't really work.Pros:* For most people, I would guess setup is easy. I just experienced issues for whatever reason. Using the camera through the app is pretty easy and intuitive.* Cost - for $30, this is a pretty good deal to get some basic home security.* Smartphone app is great - easy to use and download.* Can take a snapshot or record on the fly. Can also schedule recording for certain times/days of the week through the web management tool.* Motion detection with email alerts.Cons:* The camera is so light that if you are using the ethernet cable for a wired connection, you had better secure that camera somewhere otherwise it will topple over.* Picture isn't the best - 0.3 Megapixel (640*480).* Cannot view the camera from IE or Chrome as of this writing.* Not good in low light.I have not yet opted to use the motion detection feature. It's a little complex.For the price (as of this writing, it's $30), I'd say it's an amazing deal. You get quite a bit of functionality for that $30. Setup *can* be easy, but there's a lot of tech stuff to know if you really want to enjoy all this camera has to offer. The support and documentation take some digging to get to, and if you're not technologically adept, you'll be doing nothing more than just watching your live camera on your phone app.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YV0V25SX6ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1I97WK#wasThisHelpful","R23YV0V25SX6ED","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got into using essential oils (for scent, not for their supposed benefits) a few weeks ago. In that time, I've owned four diffusers, two of which I've returned. One thing I noticed right off the bat in my endless reading of reviews on this site, is that a LOT of people got these diffusers for a reduced cost. Check the very end of their review and you'll often see the phrase ""I received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review"" or ""I received this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review."" I was shocked at just how many reviews a lot of these diffusers had; this one has over 2000 reviews. Most people who received it in exchange for a review or at discounted price left four to five stars. But if you start looking at the reviews of people who purchased it at full price, you'll see a different story. In fact, across the board (brands), there seems to be a fairly high failure rate with these things.The technology is pretty simple, yet these diffusers seem horribly overpriced. It's hardly new technology; a mini ""humidifier"" and a few LED lights. I've had a $30 diffuser and a $60 one, a free one and a $40 one. To date, none of them are perfect. Between moist countertops, reduced output after only one week, lack of scent and small water capacity, most of these diffusers fall short.This item is indeed cute as hell. It's way smaller than I thought it would be, but it's really cute. You kinda go ""awwww"" when you see it in the box. Setup is easy (again, we're not talking about cutting-edge technology here) - fill to the fill line, add a few drops of EO and turn it on. The item is pink-ish when the light is off, but looks more red with the LEDs on. I rather like the light it emits.And, though it's a small detail (but one I've come to appreciate after owning a few of these), the fact that the adaptor plugs in the BACK and not the BOTTOM is a welcome change. Being that you have to unplug this for cleaning and/or refilling (this unit does not come with a separate cup you can fill and bring back to the unit so you don't have to unplug it), the adaptor being on the bottom is PAIN. So yay for this one having the plug on the lower back.That's kinda where the good things about this unit end.The reservoir for this unit is the smallest out of all the four that I've owned. I'm getting no more than three hours of run time before it auto shuts off. Sometimes less. The reservoir holds 80ml - that's one third of a cup of liquid. There is no intermittent feature.Also, and I have no idea if this is due to the small reservoir, the scent does not last long. I'd say 30 mins to an hour. All of our rooms are small (less than 150SF) and after an hour or so you can no longer smell any scent coming out of this diffuser. If you walk right up to it and stick your face in it, yes, but even in our small kitchen, the scent does not fill that room. I've experimented with anywhere from 3 to 10 drops and it seems to make no difference.One thing I kept reading when I was researching EOs is that their ""benefit"" was reduced if they were heated. It's worth noting that the Allay does get a little warm and the mist/vapor that comes out of the top is also sometimes warm, not a ""cool mist"".So, I'm not blown away. It does not throw a lot of scent and it does not run that long. Should you buy it? If you want 30 mins. of scent in your coat closet, sure. If you want your home to smell like whatever oil you're using, no. Pass on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAQR5LYQ07GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RODQEI#wasThisHelpful","R2FAQR5LYQ07GB","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned several portable Bluetooth speakers during the past several years, and dollar-for-dollar, this one is the best I've seen.  The sound quality is nearly identical to more expensive models, yet the weight and size is actually smaller.  It's a perfect companion on those days I'm on the mountain bike and want to hear my tunes.There's nothing major to complain about here, especially for the price.  I'm not a huge fan of the rubberized clip.  Securing it can be a little awkward, but it's not a deal-killer for me.

"Update 11/17/2015: After only one week of use, the output is already reduced. It's not putting out as much mist as it used to. It's not been tipped over, it's not been dropped. I've cleaned it properly and taken care to follow all instructions. I'll monitor it for a few more days (while another diffuser arrives in the mail), but I fear this one is going back.I've been heavily researching essential oil differs on Amazon and settled on this one after I returned my ZAQ one (it left surfaces moist after use). This diffuser is $20 more than that one and no better. Prices for diffusers range from $25 to upwards of $80. They all perform one basic function: vaporize water. Some have color-changing lights, some do not. But the concept is the same - put scent and water vapor into the air. For all these things do, I find most of them to be overpriced.It's a very nice looking diffuser. Stylish, fairly small and blends well with my decor. It starts up right away and you can see the mist coming out the top within 3 seconds.I do like the larger water reservoir and the intermittent feature. The light is nice and can ""pulse"" or be set to a certain brightness - just tap once to turn on the light and then tap again when the brightness is at the level you want.I don't care for the plug placement - I wish it was on the side, not the bottom of the unit. There is also no included pouring cup, so refilling this usually involves unplugging it and taking it to the sink. The top just sits there and is often holding condensation, so when you take the top off, be prepared to do it over a surface you don't mind getting wet.It does what it's supposed to do, but I feel similar diffusers can be had for much less.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R63DGBSRMTKSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9SKER4#wasThisHelpful","R63DGBSRMTKSQ","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like this item. It's a nice small size and fits just about anywhere. The changing colors on the top of the unit are a nice touch and I like that I can pause a certain color, too.My main complaint is that it left whatever surface I set it on damp/moist after a few hours of use. I monitored it closely for three days and after about 1.5 hours, the surface the ZAQ rested on became damp. Most of the surfaces I'll be using this on are wood/particle board, so I can't use this item without worrying about it ruining my furniture.What I did like:* Good scent disbursement. I used about 4 drops of EO each time and it really did fill the room with scent. To be fair, our rooms are small (about 120SF or less.* The color-changing LEDs are nice. They are pleasing without being too bright.* I liked the shape of this device - wide base so it's not easy to tip over.* Functions are easy to use and understand - 1 press ON, 2nd press the pause a color, 3rd press to turn off the light, 4th press to turn the unit off* Quiet.* Puts out a fair amount of mist.What I didn't like:* Condensation on the surface it sits on.* Plug on the bottom is cumbersome to undo, esp when you need to plug it back in after refilling.* Small tank that's a pain to refill.* $40 for this unit seems pricey considering it's just a diffuser with an LED light.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSOCXY7P05SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RP6GGC#wasThisHelpful","R3GSOCXY7P05SK","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an avid crafter and I have been looking for a fun and different winter hobby. I came across one of these boards in Michael's the other day and loved the idea! Within a few minutes, I was making bags! Lots of bags! The board is pretty easy to use, though it doesn't look like it at first. After my first two failed attempts, it finally clicked and I made about 15 bags in an hour or so.The board and instructions are pretty self-explanatory, but my complaints are as follows:* You really almost have to be standing to get the punch part to punch cleanly. I tried several times to punch through pretty thin kraft paper and it wouldn't cut cleanly. So, I'd recommend scoring and punching a bunch while standing and then folding and gluing while sitting.* I knew the bag sizes were limited and small and I was fine with that. However, the length of score lines is only six inches, so for bags taller than that, you'll have to make sure to fold carefully. It would be great if the board itself was about 3"" longer to allow for easier scoring of taller bags.* You'll likely need a separate cutting board to cut either the correct width and/or length. My recommendation on the bag length (height) is to just trim to the desired length *after* assembling. However, this will mean you can't use the hold punch for the top.While this is a fun hobby, it's not quick. However, it does allow for an inexpensive way to make personalized and fun bags for gifts.The board appears to be well-built and I've had fun using it!

I am very much in love with YL's ""Peace and Calming"" so when I saw this one, I jumped on it, esp since it's so much cheaper.The oils in Eden's Garden: Chamomile, Clary Sage, Copaiba, Lavender, Peru Balsam, Sandalwood, Sweet Marjoram and Ylang YlangThe oils in Young Living's Peace and Calming: Tangerine, Orange, Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, and Blue TansySo, as you can see, they have *one* scent in common. How Eden's can say this is similar is beyond me.When I first opened the bottle and took a whiff, I recoiled. It stinks. I put it in my diffuser and while the scent was a little better, it's still an odd combination of smells. It smells nothing like Peace and Calming.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTXVEFZ8RE1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9L4BTI#wasThisHelpful","R3CTXVEFZ8RE1I","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I like the case. It offers good protection for the phone. I've already dropped my iPhone (as I often do) and it survived just fine. The case has a nice clean look and really shows off my rose gold iPhone.My two issues:* The opening for the mute button makes it pretty hard to toggle it on/off. The case is wider than I'd like, and that width puts the toggle too deep in the case.* The case is extremely hard to remove. I change out cases here and there, and this one is a real pain to remove.I'm definitely keeping it, but those two issues are moderately frustrating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6P424N4OZ02R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TK7JCE#wasThisHelpful","R6P424N4OZ02R","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used these for transporting my workday lunch (typically a sandwich and some chips or cookies) over the past month.  The results are mixed, but overall the quality of the product is decent.  It's made of very sturdy plastic which is both a benefit and a drawback.The storage boxes will certainly hold up for a long time, even under rough handling.  Unfortunately, the rigid nature of the plastic makes securing the container difficult in circumstances where your food may rest slightly above the recessed lid.  Sometimes, I had to smash my chips or cookies down just to get the thing closed, and even then it was still not 100% shut.While the sandwich compartment has plenty of space, I find the two smaller bays are inadequate for most of the items I typically pack in my lunch.  I did put cottage cheese in one of the compartments, but there was some leakage into the other two.  This is not recommended for any food that may have liquid properties to it.It works great for carrying a sandwich and a few very small assorted items.  The build quality is sufficient, but I feel this product's compartment set-up really limits what you can place in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FVUW7BUXLVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFTH8WU#wasThisHelpful","R18FVUW7BUXLVF","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bose Wave IV Music System continues the company's legendary tradition of making top-notch audio products.  Even at very low volumes, the Wave IV achieves incredibly full and crisp playback.  Other speakers have to be cranked way up to appreciate the quality, but not with this Bose system.  If you're an audiophile who wants the absolute best-sounding speakers possible, I don't think there's a product that will surpass this one.My primary use for the Bose is as an auxiliary speaker for my laptop.  The MP3s and video gaming audio is incredibly rich -- significantly better than any speaker system I've owned before this one.  I'll also tune in a few local radio stations on the Bose, and like the auxiliary output, the sound quality exceeds what I can convey with a mere written description.If I have one complaint, it would be the lack of on-console buttons.  You pretty much need the remote control to perform all important functions.  You can power the unit off or on by touching the top portion.  That's about it for controlling the Bose Wave IV without a remote, however.  Don't misplace the remote control, or you'll have very limited ability to operate the console.All in all, it's a magnificent product and I'm enjoying it greatly.  You probably will, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA54U50939Y8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MBO#wasThisHelpful","R2HA54U50939Y8","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was super excited to find this product! A mold product that can be re-used?! Sweet.I almost bought the larger size (which was super expensive), but I'm glad I didn't.I heated mine in the microwave at 15-20 second intervals, like another user suggested. I never did get the middle liquefied entirely. I poured the ooze over my item (you really do need to glue it down - I didn't and I ended up with a resin piece suspended in the mold). They don't really tell you how long it takes to cure, the label just says ""allow to cool"". So I let it cool for a few hours. I would say let it cool so that it's not warm to the touch, or tacky.This stuff smells... funny. I'm not sure what the smell is, but it reminds me of the unkempt cages at the local zoo. Seriously, it's a really weird smell. Not toxic smelling, per se, but stanky.After I made my 2nd attempt at making a mold of my pieces, I pulled them out easily (did not use cooking spray). The mold looked pretty good, but I noticed my original resin pieces had a pink cast to them. So keep that in mind if you're casting clear items - they may pick up the red dye from the mold and have a pink cast.Later that night, I poured resin into the mold. Usually, the next day, I can pull the pieces out to fully cure. When I pulled these pieces out the next day, they were tacky. It took them several days to fully cure (normally, it would take less than two). The pieces remained tacky for 4-5 days. This will not work for me, as I need to make pieces quickly to sell. Oddly enough, I cast a few more clear pieces (clear, no glitter or mica powder) and they did not come out tacky. But each time I attempt to cast resin with glitter or mica mixed in, the pieces come out tacky. I use Amazing's mold rubber for all my other molds and have never had this problem.So, overall, I do not care for this product. It's a GREAT idea, but I can't deal with tacky pieces that take 5+ days to fully cure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJY5TD64MFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTJ7E9M#wasThisHelpful","R2XJY5TD64MFB","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I was pretty stoked to try this stuff. I've never bought it due to the high price tag.Upon first opening the box, you could smell the product right away. It's STRONG. The cap had come off mine, so a little had leaked out. No biggie. But this particular sent (Royal Flush) is geared towards men and it smells a little like Axe body spray/someone who's been clubbin' all night. Not a fan of the scent, but not a big deal, let's see if it works!My boyfriend tried it out the first morning on what he calls his ""old man, gravely, first-of-the-morning"" poo and yeah, it worked. Well. NO scent of poo in our impossibly small (5x8) bathroom. I was impressed. I tried it out the next day (thanks sluggish bowels) and had the same result - no. poo. smell. Amazed.So yes, the product works, well. The only thing I didn't like about this particular scent (Royal Flush) was how strong it was, and how long it lingered in the bathroom. This scent gave me a headache, but I'm very sensitive to scents. Whichever scent you use, it will linger behind after your trip to the toilet. In our small bathroom, this means it will stick around for 20-30 mins.The PooPourri is made with essential oils and no nasty chemicals - that I liked. Also made in the USA! The marketing and the packaging are hilarious!The only downside here is the cost (though I received mine for free). That's the only reason I held off on buying it for all these years. Supposedly, the 4oz. bottle will last for 200 ""uses"".Edit: I also have the Rose Geranium scent, which is much more pleasing, but also, strong.

"I've had/used many desktops, laptops and now, and all-in-one. Windows 10 is new to me, but I won't comment on that much and just stick to the Toshiba hardware and software. This is my first Toshiba laptop/computer.The unit is nice and light and slim. Must less so than my last Dell laptop. But, to be fair, that was over three years ago. The laptop doesn't look particularly high end; the design is simple but nice.What I liked:*Keyboard is nice and easy to use. I like the low profile keys.* Display is nice and bright* Design of the laptop is simple, but classy looking. It's all plastic, but it looks pretty nice for a mid-range laptop.What I didn't like:* Seems to be a little laggy with even basic things like opening a browser. Each time I got on this computer, it was slow to boot up, slow to open programs and just slow in general.* Buttons below the touchpad are a little too firm.* Display is sufficient - contrast is good and colors appear rich and vibrant.Problems:* The cursor sometimes gets stuck between pointing mode and text mode. I could not get it unstuck.* The edges of the laptop on the bottom where the keyboard is are really sharp. When your arms/hands are resting on the area before the keyboard, the edges are oftentimes bothersome. A rounded edge would have been a better choice.* The space bar sometimes doesn't register. In fact, this happens a lot. You really have to hit the space bar aggressively to get it to respond sometimes. This will be a real problem for someone who types a lot.For the price, it's an OK computer. Not the best, not the worst. I found that using it usually meant my palms would hurt from the sharp edges and the laggy processor meant frequent frustrations. There's nothing that really stands out about this laptop and of all the laptops and desktops I've owned, this one seems a little slow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJRDW3FHGL32U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBAJDS#wasThisHelpful","RJRDW3FHGL32U","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Prime member, I was so excited when this app came out - ""free"" music! However, this is one of the worst interfaces I've seen, and I'm pretty tech savvy. I've seen several updates made to the app, and each time, it doesn't get any better. I can't tell the difference between my music, music I've downloaded (but not paid for) and I have no idea if I'm streaming music or playing it off my phone. There's a cloud library and an offline library, but they seem to contain the same thing.I never really cared too much about this (whether I was streaming or playing my music ""offline"") until I started using the app again recently and noticed I was using a lot of data on my phone. I started clearing my statistics on my phone to see how much the Amazon Music app was using. On my trip to work, which is about 10 mins, if I listen to Amazon music, it uses about 25 - 45MB. By contrast, I fired up Pandora and for the same 10 mins, it used 2.5MB.

"Like the other reviewer said, this lamp does NOT look like the image on the box, color-wise. And one of the images shown here on Amazon shows it going from purple at the top down to pink. In reality, the color starts at pink at the top and ends on purple. Also, the colors are nowhere near as nicely spaced as the images show. I'd say the lamp is about 50% red and pink and then there are very narrow band of yellow, green and blue. I have a *very* hard time believing anything about this globe is ""hand painted"".Lava Lite has a long history (esp since moving production to China in 2003) of quality issues and product images that are deceptively deceiving. You'll almost never see a real image of the product being used on their packaging. There's a reason for that. Most common issues you'll encounter (so save your receipt) are: cloudy/hazy liquid that never clears, gunk/dark bits in the metal coil at the bottom, wax sticking to the bottom of the globe and poor flow. I can almost guarantee any lamp you buy from Lava Lite post-2003 will have at least one of these issues. How do I know? I've bought over 20 of them (and returned/sold/gave away 75% of them). I'm a collector of lava lamps and if you truly want a beautiful lamp that will last, buy a pre-2003 off eBay.The Rainbow Grande looks better off than it does on. When the lamp is turned on, you can see just how poor the spray job is. Not only is the saturation of the spray lighter than I'd like, but you can see how spotty it is. My globe had several spray smudges/defects towards the bottom of the globe.The lamps takes about 2-3 hours to flow with the provided bulb in a house that's about 78 degrees.The base and cap are nothing exceptional. For a lamp this vibrant, a black or white base would have been nice. My base came with one small ding in it. Otherwise, it's decent.I ran the lamp for a few weeks before I decided to return it. The flow was good, but the main attraction - the rainbow part - wasn't as vibrant as I'd wanted. Every time I turned it on, I noticed the poor spray job and was disappointed. For this cost, it just wasn't as stunning as I'd hoped. The colors are un-evenly spaced and the spotty spray job was hard to ignore. I'd pass on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRM0UQDKCHZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YORJMYU#wasThisHelpful","RRM0UQDKCHZK","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're prone to spills or making a mess while measuring out laundry detergent, this product is just what you need. That seems to be the main selling point of Wisk PowerBlasts from what I can tell.  Everything else is fairly unremarkable. It does a good job of getting clothes clean, and the scent is pleasantly fresh but not overwhelming, which is what I want from a laundry detergent. Most of my clothes consist of darker colors, I really can't attest to how it will handle whites or other lighter shades.  However, all my shirts came out looking clean and weren't discolored at all. The scent does not really carry past the dryer though. When I took my clothes out the dryer, the scent was gone.It's a convenient product because you just throw one of the pods into the bottom of your washer; no  measuring or scooping is required.

"I've burned scented candles for years with my current faves being Yankee and IKEA (yes, scented candles from IKEA). I am somewhat particular about scents, as some can give me a headache. I tend to prefer flora;/plant smells and stay away from the ones that smell like food.This candle has a nice, pleasing scent. It's not so overpowering that it's bothersome, but you can definitely smell it when you walk into the room. I have it in my 10x12 bedroom and it's not overwhelming. The dandle has two wicks and appears to have a thin metal piece in the center of the wick.The glass jar and label are very nice - it seems like a very well-made candle, demanding a slightly higher price.

"I've been casting with epoxy resin for a few months now. After looking for cheaper alternatives to Ice resin, I found Alumilite Amazing Clear Resin. Alumilite resin, while cheaper, does have a very slight yellow-ish cast. You won't even notice it unless you had it next to another identical piece cast in another kind of resin.I came across this seller/brand and figured for the price, I'd give it a try. I only do small castings (1oz. or less at a time), so I needed to make sure this would work. Based on the description here and on their website, it seemed it would work for my projects (which include magnets, ornaments and buttons).Instructions were found on their website, as well as included with the product. It's mixed just like Ice and Alumilite - stir for 2-3 mins. with flat stick, scraping the sides. I don't agree with their instructions to ""mix vigorously"", as that creates more air bubbles. So, mix slowly. Then, let it sit for 3-5 mins. so some of the air bubbles rise and pop.It pours nicely and can be de-molded in 24 hours. It's rock hard in 48 hours. It's very clear and I prefer it over Alumilite. I will continue to use this brand as it's worked out very well for me! The only downside is that since I do such small pours, I had to put it in a different container that had a small opening for pouring.Cost per oz. (including shipping) as of this writing is $.70/oz. Check out the seller's website for cheaper pricing and larger sizes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MQKR1ZWUSK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOT2764#wasThisHelpful","R8MQKR1ZWUSK7","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is pretty easy to use, it's the mold container and mixing ratios that might trip you up. If you're making a whole container of the stuff, great - just pour the liquid into the gooey stuff, mix and pour. But if you're making a smaller batch, it's 10 parts silicone to 1 part liquid. I use a gram scale and it works out just fine.You have a few minutes of mixing before this starts to set up, so mix quickly and pour. I blow out the air bubbles on top of the surface with a straw. The rubber sets up in about four hours.I have made about 6-7 molds with this stuff and it makes a great copy of your original item and my resin pieces have turned out great. It captures detail very well.However, two of my molds are now ""done"" as they have started to degrade and stick to my resin pieces. I wrote the company today about the shelf life of these molds (I had hoped they'd last longer than 4 months) and the customer service rep informed me that this product will produce molds that are good for about 30 - 50 ""pulls"" (meaning casts). You can get closer to the 50 pulls number if you use a releasing agent. I really wish this information was included somewhere on the packaging or instructions.So, two of my molds are unusable, with more to join that status as I use them more. The last piece I pulled out of the rubber mold was actually stuck to it, so I had to cut/tear it out. Please see attached photos for the mold that's now unusable.At $15 for a kit, with the molds only lasting for about 30-50 pulls, I'm not sure I'll be using this product again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDF8V9YQVGJOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FD8H08O#wasThisHelpful","RDF8V9YQVGJOX","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the more unique bluetooth speakers I've seen. We have about four of them in our house. :) Nice to see something different looking and fun.Right off the bat, I noticed the interesting packaging and super neon yellow charging cord. Nice to see something different.I easily paired my iPhone to the speaker and was up and running. I installed the app, which allows you to interact with the speaker by powering it on, adjusting the equalizer, setting an alarm and other features. I use the app primarily to turn on the UE Roll and check the battery life.The first few times I played around with the speaker, I noticed a drop in volume when I would switch songs. I am not sure why that happened. There was one other time where the max volume was severely limited and not very loud. I don't regularly experience that issue, but it was an odd one.The speaker itself feels very sturdy and well-made. I can even feel the + and - stitching in the dark to lower/raise the volume. There's a neat bungee-type cord that wraps around the back that allows you to hand the item or fasten it easy to a bike handle, arm of a chair, etc. I took mine into the kitchen and strapped it to a cupboard handle to listen to music while I cooked.The app and using the speaker in general is very easy. No complaints there.The sound is good, but I am not an audiophile. I was more than pleased with the quality of the sound for my needs. The only time I struggle with the sound is when I have it lying flat - the sound doesn't project well around the sides. Again, not a big deal, just turn it up a little.The back is a heavy rubber and makes holding it easy. I didn't really care for the charging port under the flap (somewhat awkward to open and charge), but it's not a dealbreaker. I'm guessing that flap helps with the water resistant aspect of this speaker.Overall, this is a great speaker and I'd recommend it. I can only hope I don't experience any more of the volume issues however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FDR9G28N8ZII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YARCGHO#wasThisHelpful","R2FDR9G28N8ZII","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Android phone. I've had an iPhone ever since they came out, so please note that in my review of this phone. What phone you've had before you review a new phone will certainly influence your feel about a different OS/manufacturer. I've played around with Android in general (helping people set up their phones) and both my SO and mom have a Samsung Galaxy S5, so I'm somewhat familiar with Android, mostly Samsung's version of it.I will try and stay away from reviewing Android and keep my review mostly limited to the phone's hardware, Sony's proprietary apps and the overall experience of using the Xperia.I got lucky and my SIM from my iPhone 6 (a nanoSIM) fits the Xperia.The phone came and Android Lollipop. Sony's version of Android (for me) was pretty easy to use and navigate. I'm somewhat techy savvy, so even coming from an iPhone, I didn't struggle in poking my way around the OS. The phone was pretty easy to setup, even for someone who's used to iOS. After my first evening with the phone, I had figured my way around it, installed a few apps, hid an app and customized all of my settings.Right off the bat, I noticed this phone gets pretty warm, even with minimal use. I got several prompts noting that if the phone reaches a certain temperature, the app will close. I turned that notification off, as in less than an hour, I'd seen it three times. I don't believe it *has* overheated, but the constant warnings were annoying.On-board storage is 16GB, some of which Android eats up, so you'll definitely want to get a microSD card immediately. I had about 9GB free as of this writing.The screen is nice, crisp and clear. I initially thought the brightness range was a bit weak, but after I turned off the adaptive brightness, I saw I could make the screen much brighter. The screen, and the back of the phone, are fingerprint magnets (like many phones) and it wasn't long before the phone was covered in smudges and prints. The back of the phone is plastic (not glass). The screen is nice, but not as rich as vibrant as other Android devices I've seen.The phone itself without a case is pretty slippery. Though I only spent one day with it ""naked"", I lived in constant fear of dropping it. It's a sharp-looking phone - very sleek and minimalist. The power button is oddly-placed in the middle of the right-hand side of the phone. And the charging port is also oddly located at the top left. No biggie though. Just not used to it. The volume +/- button isn't obvious at first, but it's on the right-hand side below the power button, with no indication of +/- near it to tell you what it's for.Battery life: Sony claims this phone will provide two days of battery life with average usage. I did not find that to be the case. I'm a mid-range user, power-wise, and at the end of most days with this phone, I was down to 20-30% battery. There's no way I could get two days out of this phone.Bloatware: There's a decent amount of Sony (and non-Sony) ""stuff"" on this phone, including AVG Protection, Album (Sony online storage), File Commander, Movies, News from Socialife, Video Unlimited and What's New (to name a few). Most of these I did not find useful, so I un-installed or hid them.Performance: The phone is fairly snappy, processor-wise, but I did find some stops and stutters when browsing the web. And sometimes, I'd have to touch the screen twice to get it to perform the function I was wanting. I did keep in mind that this is a mid-range phone, so for that segment, I'd say it performs as expected. I'm not used to any sort of lagging or stuttering when using a mobile OS, so this was a mild annoyance for me. Startup times for apps and commands was a bit slower than I was used to as well.The camera was probably the most disappointing part of this phone. Despite having a 13MP camera, the photos were not that great in comparison to other mobile phone cameras I've used (Samsung Galaxy and iPhone). Even taking a picture was a cumbersome process due to the slight lag when loading and delay after pressing the shutter button. I messed around with several of the options (Manual, SCN mode, etc.) to try and get a better shot, but none of them wowed me. The photos aren't the worst I've seen, but they were not impressive at all. I posted a few to Facebook and they were pretty horrible.The interface for calls on the phone wasn't very intuitive, but I finally figured out how to get back and forth between the phone and contacts. Calls were fine, although even with the volume all the way up, I struggled to hear some callers. I don't spend a lot of time on the phone, so this was not a deal breaker for me.The more I used the phone, the more I liked it. I got used to Android (at least Sony's version of it) quicker than I thought I would. The biggest letdowns were the camera and the lack-luster battery life.Other than that, it's an all-around good phone.I'd really like to rate this phone as 3.5/5 stars, but I can't, so I'll bump it up to four considering for the price, it's a good phone and does everything you'll need it to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZJOD2512UVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102OM1IC#wasThisHelpful","R3JZJOD2512UVY","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never used an electric razor before. Mostly due to cost and also because I've never had any complaints about shaving my pits and legs, I was eager to try this out, as the idea of shaving my legs while watching the tube appealed to me. And the fact that I could do it ""dry"" also seemed like a neat idea.The shaver is really nice looking. Very sleek and smooth and comfortable to hold in your hand.I let it charge and then went to work. The first time I tried it, I did it ""dry"" sitting in a chair. The manual says to shave in a circular motion. I shaved most of my right leg. I still felt stubble. Like, end-of-the-day-after-you've-shaved-in-the morning stubble. I went over it again, pressing a little harder. Still, stubble. No matter what I did, or how many times I went over it, there was still a rough feeling to my legs. I popped the head off and sure enough there were hairs in there, so it works, but it does not provide a close shave.Next, I tried it in the shower. Lathered up my legs and did the right leg with the Remington and the left with my usual disposable razor. Not only did it take over twice as long to shave the right leg, again, I was left with stubble. You couldn't see it necessarily, but you could definitely feel it. The left leg was smooth and went quickly, the right leg was rough and took forever.If this is as good as it gets with electric razors for women, color me unimpressed. Not only does it take forever to shave your legs with this razor, cheap disposable razors gave me a a much smoother leg.This is a beautiful product that's easy to use, charge and clean, but it's primary function falls way short and for that, I cannot recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDKMN20C6Y3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UF7FE4U#wasThisHelpful","R1TDKMN20C6Y3L","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product itself is very easy to mix and pour. It's not toxic smelling.I poured the silicone over my original piece and let it cure overnight. The next day, I popped out my original with ease and had a very nice mold.The next day I poured epoxy resin (from Specialty Resins) into the mold at a depth of about 1/2"" and let it cure 24 hours. I then added a second layer of resin at a depth of about 1/4"" and let it cure another 24 hours.When I popped my piece of out the mold, it was tacky. Two days later, it's still tacky and will not fully cure. The part of the piece that faced the open air is totally cured, but all parts of the pieces that touched the mold are sticky to the touch. I've used this brand of resin in several types of molds (silicone, plastic, etc) and never experienced this problem, so the issue is the compatibility with this silicone rubber. Despite the product description saying it's suitable with resin, per my response from OOMOO today, they said they ""cannot guarantee compatibility with competitor resins"". I can't seem to find much on the internet, but I did find something about ""tin-cure"" silicone rubber not being compatible with epoxy resins. If that's the case, I can only hope the manufacturer updates the description.Unfortunately, I now have a very expensive bottle of silicone rubber I cannot use for my resin molds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCPNX52OJAE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BNF3TK#wasThisHelpful","R1OCPNX52OJAE6","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an adult female and am always carrying water with me. This bottle is so cute that it's the one I usually grab.The bottle is well-built, colorful and sturdy. It also does not leak. I like the pop-up button, too. The straw, bottle and top come apart for easy cleaning.My only gripe with the Contigo bottles (I have another, adult-sized one) is the effort in which you have to make to get the liquid out. There's quite a bit of sucking going on and you can't just ""pour"" water into your mouth. Weird ""con"", I know, but I often take medication with these bottles and you can't just pour the water into your mouth - you have to suck it through a straw and that makes taking pills a chore.

"This is probably the prettiest knife I own. It's a gorgeous white and green and comes with a sheath. I hate to admit it, but when I have knives with sheaths, I find myself reaching for them less due to the extra effort of removing them. Lame, I know, but it's true. It does fit very snuggly in the sheath, so no worries about it falling out.This knife is gorgeous and comfy to use. It fits well in your hand.This is my first ceramic knife, so I didn't know what to expect. In cutting cantaloupe with it, I thought it didn't cut as smoothly as my regular serrated knives. It's sharp, sure, but most of my knives are serrated, so I've come to get use to how they cut and this knife didn't seem as smooth when cutting. It gets the job done though.There are some very nice perks to this knife though - it won't rust ('cause it's ceramic), the protective sheath is a nice touch and it's certainly nice to look at. But I'm finding it's not the first knife I grab when I need to cut something as I have knives that are older, steel and cut better.Update: my knife now has two little pieces that have broken off of it - the tip, and a little piece on the cutting side of the blade. While this doesn't impact its use, it's frustrating to know this knife can ship, and even more frustrating when you can't find that little chip and wonder if it ended up in your food.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLI1LXYUK9ZPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7UOTU0#wasThisHelpful","RLI1LXYUK9ZPS","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And despite seeing rabbits in my yard all the time, esp near my garden, I haven't seen one in weeks, so I'm calling this product a success.Yes, the smell is terrible, but once applied, you can't smell them in your yard.

"I'll admit it - we've never had a toaster with a single feature except ""toast"" - meaning, slide the lever down and wait.We've found setting '4' makes a perfect slide of toast for us. And yes, it does indeed toast faster than our previous model. Do pay attention to the number setting though - the dial notch/stripe is hard to read and it's easy to accidentally rotate it while handling the toaster, resulting is much burnt toast. We only use this for toast and bagels, so I can't comment on much else about it.The slots are nice and wide for toasting bagels and English muffins without doing damage to your breads. There's many a time I've had to pry out a bagel from our toaster since I had to shove it in there in the first place.This is a nice-looking toaster, though it will spent all its time in a drawer.

"It wasn't until the third of fourth time I kept getting resin on my hands while mixing with these that I noticed many of these cups had gouges in them at the top. Approximately 45% of the 100 cup order had holes/gouges/slits towards the tip of the rim which means that for any sort of liquid measuring (which is what most people use these for), a real problem was present.

"I spent four hours power washing my house and deck with this unit last weekend. Setup was easy and I really didn't need to use the instructions until I couldn't find the tips to attach. I like that you attach tips for different purposes instead of a whole separate wand like my other power washer. The tips are neatly snapped into the side of the washer. Green for narrow, more-powerful washing and white for wider, moderately-powerful washing.This is a 1700psi washer and it didn't feel as strong as others I'd used. I power washed some of my cedar fence, vinyl siding on the house and my entire cedar desk. Despite the instructions saying that I should use the white tip for softer woods, I found it wasn't powerful enough to get the grime off the wood. I was worried that it would blow the cedar to bits with the power washer, but it did a great job.I spent four hours power washing the deck and house and the unit performed beautifully. No hiccups or anything. I did notice that I had to be REALLY close to the surface to get it clean. Like, 6 inches or less. I don't remember having to get that close with previous power washers.A few very minor annoyances:* The part where the garden hose connects to the side of the unit leaked a little and I had to re-tighten several times.* The top spindle that winds the wand cord unwinds very easily. There's no locking mechanism to keep it in place.* No handle lock; holding the wand in the on position for four hours can get really tiresome.* The electrical cord doesn't really have a good place to be stored/wound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSCHJXGD1QMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSQ4XUE#wasThisHelpful","R1CSCHJXGD1QMU","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been casting with epoxy resin for a few months now. After looking for cheaper alternatives to Ice resin, I found Alumilite Amazing Clear Resin. Alumilite resin, while cheaper, does have a very slight yellow-ish cast. You won't even notice it unless you had it next to another identical piece cast in another kind of resin.I came across this seller/brand and figured for the price, I'd give it a try. I only do small castings (1oz. or less at a time), so I needed to make sure this would work. Based on the description here and on their website, it seemed it would work for my projects (which include magnets, ornaments and buttons).Instructions were found on their website, as well as included with the product. It's mixed just like Ice and Alumilite - stir for 2-3 mins. with flat stick, scraping the sides. I don't agree with their instructions to ""mix vigorously"", as that creates more air bubbles. So, mix slowly. Then, let it sit for 3-5 mins. so some of the air bubbles rise and pop.It pours nicely and can be de-molded in 24 hours. It's rock hard in 48 hours. It's very clear and I prefer it over Alumilite. I will continue to use this brand as it's worked out very well for me! The only downside is that since I do such small pours, I had to put it in a different container that had a small opening for pouring.Cost per oz. (including shipping) as of this writing is $1.12/oz. Check out the seller's website for cheaper pricing and larger sizes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHJ4RXLKI2V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOSSCZA#wasThisHelpful","R2RHJ4RXLKI2V5","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat concept, and something I've never had before. I *do* love Philips' products and have been happily using their GoLITE BLU all winter for mood and energy.This is a cool-looking device, but right out of the box, I thought it felt kinda cheap. The plastic on the front feels very cheap and flimsy and the way the clock radio sits on your table or nightstand seems to indicate it would tip over pretty easy. I worried that each time I tapped the top of the unit to ""snooze"" it, it would tip over. Luckily, it doesn't. But the design of the clock radio is an odd one - it's a pretty big disc and then a little leg on the back. There are two very small nubs (size of a pin head) towards the front to assist in stability, but it does always look quite precariously-placed.Setup was pretty easy via the included directions, but I found it was not intuitive enough to set up the device without them. I do like that there are four different brightness levels for the clock. My last clock radio had two settings - bright and brighter. LOL. As someone who has about 12 LEDs in her room at night, I don't need another bright clock staring at me as I sleep.There are three options to wake up - birds, other birds and the radio. I didn't think the birds would wake me up (didn't think I'd be able to hear them), but they did. I actually LOVE birds and own six pet birds, so I wondered if I'd just sleep right through them. Luckily, I did not. The wake-up light comes on gradually 30 mins before the alarm goes off and stays on even during snooze. For me, that meant nearly one hour of the light being on while i tapped the top of the device every 9 minutes. When you're ready to get up, touch the alarm button to shut off the alarm and then tap again to set for tomorrow.There are different light brightness and alarm volume settings that can be tweaked, which is pretty cool. I'm still figuring out which are the best for me.The radio is rather sub-par. The sound is not good, but passable. The little FM antenna wire does help pull in my local talk radio station, but looks pretty awkward snaking out of the back of the device. I've never been a fan of these kinds of antennas, as I'm not sure what you're supposed to do with them exactly; wrap them around the nearest tall object? Let them hang over the side of the table? Bend into neat shapes?Pros:* Cool-looking design* Orange LED clock is pleasant and has an adjustable brightness (something a lot of reviewers missed - the clock brightness *is* adjustable)* When you get your hand next to the front of the device, the ""buttons"" light up* Gentle way to wake up each morningThe cons are as follows:* No battery backup* Pretty crummy radio* FM antenna is clumsy and takes away from the design of the unit* Cheap-feeling plastic used on front* Awkward stature; looks and feels like it could topple over at any moment (though it doesn't)Overall, I like it. I'm not real keen about the snooze mechanism and the wake-up light hasn't proven to make me feel any more refreshed (yet), but it's replaced my previous clock radio and done a decent job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK94PH7P1WHW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E91EGDS#wasThisHelpful","RK94PH7P1WHW1","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had several AeroGardens many years ago, long before Miracle Grow co-opted them. I had two of the smaller 3-pod ones and two of the larger ones (including the pricey Veggie Pro). I eventually sold them all, as they became more hassle than they were worth. My biggest complaint back then was proprietary bulbs and overall business plan; their website, their marketing and their support was spotty, at best, and it was just a VERY expensive way to grow vegetables, flowers and herbs.I recently acquired a 7-pod model for free and luckily, found bulb adapters so I wasn't locked into their pricey $10 CFLs. My interest became renewed. These are a really cool thing to have indoors during cold Midwestern winters, so when I had the opportunity to grab one on Amazon Vine, I jumped. I'm an outdoor gardener, so I'm always happy to see green things growing in winter.This little 3-pod model is cute as heck. The design is quite nice, actually. The concept was still entirely the same - pop in the pods, add some nutrients, fill with water and you're on your way. However, it wasn't long before I ran into problems. After the first day, the ""bubbler"", or pump, or whatever it's called, quit working. I saw it bubble on day one (a little) and then it was no more. I know these units have been prone to this issue over the years, but I'd personally never had a pump go bad in one of mine. I can hear the motor run, but no air comes out (or so I thought). Also worth noting: the pump doesn't run when the lights are off. So, I now have stagnant water. I wrote customer service on March 2nd - and received a replacement part that fixed the issue. The ""aerator"" had gummy stuff in there, so before you think it might be the pump, check the plastic thing inside the grow box that goes over the pump - it might be clogged. The part unscrews. Might benefit by having larger holes in it, too. So, it wasn't the pump - it was the aerator. Simple enough fix that I could have likely fixed on my own.On the 2nd day, I noticed the timer was off, too. I plugged it in at 4:30pm so it's ""on"" time would be while I was away from work. After the first day, it came back on at 3:45 and then at 3:00pm the day after that. So, that will be an annoying issue to contend with. Each day, it continues to come on earlier and earlier.Though some of the newer AeroGardens use LED technology, this unit does not. So sadly, you're locked into those stupid proprietary $10 bulbs.The basil bloomed first (it's usually the first to make its appearance), followed by the dill and then the parsley. You'll want to watch for white fuzz (mold) during the first few days and if you see it, just pick (or tweeze) it off. You can also remove one of the plastic domes and that should inhibit further mold growth as well.So far, everything is growing well. The basil is, of course, growing like crazy (as basil does) and the dill is pretty spindly, as only one seed germinated. Parsley is new to me, I'm interested to see how much that produces. I've already had to raise the light a few times;  make sure you prune back your basil so it gets more bushy rather than tall.This is an expensive, albeit fun, way to grow herbs for your kitchen. The unit is pretty small and I suspect all my plants are going to be pretty cramped in a matter of weeks. The proprietary bulbs are going to be your biggest cost at $10 a piece but everything can else can be had for cheap (seeds, pods - you can re-use the cages and plastic domes). The timer issue is definitely annoying, too. The unit does work and work well, though you might be better off going with one of the larger models with LEDs if you really want to produce more than a few leaves of basil here and there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQFWFMDOROO4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY3JQSA#wasThisHelpful","RQFWFMDOROO4F","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is AWESOME-smelling shampoo. Really nice. I don't often get that jazzed about a certain scent, but this stuff smells really good. Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately, since I'm sometimes scent sensitive), the smell doesn't really stay much with you after your hair dries.My hair does feel very clean and fresh after using it. I don't feel any sort of build-up or waxy feel to my hair at all. It lathers really really, too. I would say this shampoo is at least the same, if not better than most I use.

""Hand-harvested"" cassia seeds did make me take note, but it would not influence me buying a product or not. I pretty much go by how my hair and scalp feel after use of a product. I can tell you my hair feels wonderful, it smells great (though subtle) and I have thoroughly enjoyed using this shampoo. I would definitely add this to my regular rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KB09YJMVGVYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP25R34#wasThisHelpful","R3KB09YJMVGVYV","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had two other George Foreman grills in the past - a little blue one from college (for one person) and a GR2080B 5-Serving Classic Plate Grill. Both always did a GREAT job of cooking meat and draining the fat. Neither had any bells or whistles, but I always like them for their simplicity; they did what I needed them to do and did it well.My only complaint with the grills was the difficulty in cleaning them. Neither had removable plates, so cleaning them was an awkward hassle. Some of the coating would wear off over time, but it wasn't that big of a deal since it was only usually the little nubs that lost their coating.This grill is a nice upgrade from my GR2080B, though all of the improvements weren't necessary for my needs. My favorite part, obviously, is the removable plates. It's SO much easier to clean now! The plates remove and re-attach pretty easily. The ceramic coating seems to be of better quality than the coating on my GR2080B - it's slicker and cleans even easier than the other non-stick coating. Based on the lighter coating of the grill, it's easier to see when you've missed a spot cleaning it, too.The temp and timer I have mixed feelings about. I'm used to NOT having these options and since I'm not well-versed on what temp to cook what meats, I just always set it to 425 and grill whatever I'm going to grill. None of my previous George Foreman's had this option and my meat always grilled just fine. So now, I just set it to 425 and grill everything that way. My previous grills didn't have timers, either, so I got used to not using them - I tend to just take a peek every few mins. The same v and ^ buttons adjust the timer and the temp and I've found that I just don't bother messing with it - I set the grill to 425 and just grill my meat. The temp and timer options seem to be an added hassle that I didn't need.The grill seems to take a little longer to get to temp than my previous grills. Not a deal-breaker, but I know I'm waiting longer to start grilling than I did with my previous models.The cord is stupidly short.The quality, despite the $100 price tag, seems a little cheap. It's not horrible, but for an item of this cost, it feels a little cobbled together. It's heavy enough, but by no means does this feel high-end. The lever on the side to adjust the angle of the grill is oddly-placed and not easy to use.We've made waffles on it, too, and it did a fine job. It says not to use cooking spray and one of the corners of the waffles did stick a little.Overall, I like it. It will replace both my old George Foreman and my cruddy waffle-maker, so that's a plus! For the cost, I'm not sure it's worth the upgrade if you don't need the timer and temp settings though, or the waffle plates. If you just need to grill meat, there are much cheaper options that will suit your needs just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUM4TG7AEYJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK18O#wasThisHelpful","R3TUM4TG7AEYJB","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the search for cheaper alternatives to dye epoxy resin for casting, someone on the internet mentioned this stuff. I have used both these and the Dye-Na-Flow to color my resin for casting. I've experienced no problems so far. The Lumiere stuff is nice and has a shimmery sheen to it.

"I'm fairly new to resin (casting), but have been buying and using Ice resin for a few months now. Ice resin is expensive, so I wanted to see what else was out there, esp since I'm not selling anything I'm making and just messing around. Most of this review will compare this product to Ice resin. At the time of this writing, Ice Resin is about 50% more expensive than Alumilite. Luckily for me, too, you can find this at Michael's and with one of their 50% off coupons, you can get this for about $11 total.I'm only one set of these bottles in, but so far, I'm impressed. I make magnets, charms and general resin pieces from silicone molds, plastic molds and molds I made myself (from that two-part putty stuff). This stuff smells slightly less toxic than Ice, but the smell of both is not overly bothersome to me. I do not work with a mask or ventilation and have not had any issues. The mixing instructions are virtually the same - mix 2 mins. set for 5 mins, then pour. I always pour the thicker stuff first (part B), then part A and mix slowly with a wooden stick, scraping the sides. To get bubbles out, I use my breath and/or a straw. I also set the mix in front of a space heater for half of the 5 min. resting time to get the larger bubbles to rise to the surface. Once the item is poured into my mold, I do check it a few more times over the next 30 mins. and use a straw to blow out any more bubbles I see. I mix 1 - 2 tbsp batches at a time (so pretty small batches).Pouring and working with the Alumilite resin is nearly the same as working with Ice resin. They both are de-moldable in about 24 hours and rock hard in 48 - 72 hours. They are both pretty clear, but the Ice resin is a tad more clear and there is a very (and I say VERY) sight yellow cast to the Alumilite. Unless you were comparing the two side-by-side, you wouldn't even notice it. If looking at the two, the Ice seems to have a cool tone to it and the Alumilite a warm tone - maybe that's a better way of putting it. A lot of what I make has glittery backgrounds, so you can't tell one magnet from the next - they are both clear and shiny.There are oftentimes a lot of very small (nearly microscopic) bubbles in my pieces, but I've been reading that's common with a lot of casting resins and unless you have a de-gasser, this is to be expected. You can't see them unless you're really close to the piece. There's also something to be said for the temp of the room you're pouring in. I mix and pour in my basement, which is at least 10 degrees cooler than my upstairs. I then bring the pieces upstairs to cure for the next 24 hours. I rarely leave them in the basement to cure, but I'm currently experimenting with that process. Warming the resin in a bowl of hot water (in the bottles, of course) and/or putting it in front of space heater makes the resin more runny. It will still cure the same (from what I can tell), but I'm wondering what effect temperature has to do with curing time and bubbles. I'm still learning.So far, this is proving to be a great and much cheaper alternative to Ice resin. For what I'm using it for, it's perfect. Easy to work with, low order, clear and strong. I'll continue to purchase it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8NFZN4C6RL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVYNQ4U#wasThisHelpful","R1T8NFZN4C6RL3","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the same scissors for years. I bought them years ago. They're fine. I didn't know there were so many different kinds of scissors out there, to be honest. Sharper scissors, scissors with titanium blades. Non-stick scissors.I do a fair amount of crafting - yarn, resin, cutting photographs, cutting resin, etc, so these are a great pair to have around. They've been a delight to cut with and are quickly becoming my go-to scissors in the craft room. The blades are long, sharp and non-stick - what else could you need? They are comfortable in the hand and easy to locate due to the bright pink color. You can even adjust the blade tension. My other pair of scissors are not bent handle and I didn't know there was a difference, but there is. I prefer the bent handle, but only slightly.These blades cut through duct tape with ease! Neat! I didn't expect that.No complaints. Really. These are great scissors!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WGC0Q11611W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQSGJV4#wasThisHelpful","R27WGC0Q11611W","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A little background. I haven't dyed my hair (all over) in about 15 years. Every few years, I might get red highlights, but that's about it. I don't use product. I don't style my hair. I only blow dry it for work. I have thin, fine dark brown hair. My hair is very healthy, albeit thin. I admittedly was hesitant to try this since I really do love my color, but when I do get highlights, I always got red, so I thought why not...So, this hair dye went on very healthy, un-dyed, un-highlighted 100% natural hair.The process was only slightly different than what I remembered from 15 years ago. There's an extra step here: roots first, save 25% of the mix, add bottle 2, then color the rest. Did it make any difference? Probably not on my hair since I had no previous color on it before.Kit comes with everything you need and some conditioner for the next six washes. The smell of the dye wasn't as toxic as I'd remembered, which was nice. The stuff will stain anything it touches though (duh), so be careful.It took a LOT of washing and shampooing my hair THREE TIMES (in a row) to get this stuff out. I have a bob haircut and used the whole product, so there was a lot of dye in there. I was amazed at how much work it took to rinse the dye out.I was left with an orange blotchy scalp afterwards that I can only hope will clear up soon, as it does not look good.Hair itself feels great. The color is just about exactly what I thought it would be (per the box), so that's good. Despite getting every hair covered, there appear to be two or three spots I missed along my hairline.I'll update in a few days to see how much the color fades and if my orange spotty scalp clears. UPDATE: took about 3 days for the orange scalp spots to clear. Color is holding up well. Many compliments have been received. I'd use this brand and color again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C74Y5CALTV3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OE34NP2#wasThisHelpful","R1C74Y5CALTV3N","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a lot of crafting and never really gave too much thought to the different kinds of scissors that are out there until I had a chance to review some through the Vine program. I cut paper, photo paper, fabric, resin, cardboard, yarn, plastic and other materials regularly. I currently did not a have a pair of scissors like these in my arsenal of supplies. In fact, I only had two kinds of scissors - fabric and what I call ""general purpose"".These are nice. They are very comfortable to use and feel nice in your hands. The first thing I attempted to cut did inform me that not all scissors are for all things; I tried cutting a piece of paper, and yes, they cut paper, but due to the short blades and the bigger plastic hinge behind them, it was a pain. They are meant for smaller (paper) jobs, like cutting small images out of paper.The blades are sharp. VERY sharp. I liked that. They come with a blade guard and a lanyard. I will not be using the lanyard and since I don't have kids, the blade guard is not needed. I don't use them on my knives, so I won't use it on my scissors.The fine, sharp tips are indeed great for detailed cutting. The only thing I really struggled with was round cuts, or turning. For some reason, due to the short blades, cutting and turning was really difficult with these scissors. Maybe they are just meant for straight cutting and not cutting round edges.The scissors being able to lock closed in a nice touch and the ability to adjust the tension is cool, too. One little odd thing I noticed is that the light pink part of my pair is really muted. It's almost tan or flesh colored. I have another pair of this brand the light pink is very much light pink. Maybe these had been sitting in the sun or on a shelf for a long time. No biggie, but they kinda looked dirty when I got them due to the weird faded pink color.Overall, a great pair of scissors that will be much-needed addition to my crafting projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M31TQ10U5H32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R6FZNW#wasThisHelpful","R2M31TQ10U5H32","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though these are TOTALLY delicious, they really taste far more like a straight up candy bar. I've tried several protein/energy ""healthy"" bars, and these do have the best taste. Likely because they're not what I'd call healthy, per se.The taste is excellent. Again, likely due to the sugar/sweet and all the yummy ingredients. The crisp rice is a nice touch. They would make a good breakfast meal replacement, but at 250 cals, they are a little high for a snack.You can definitely taste the chocolate and the crisp rice, but the peanut butter part of the flavor is muted. And they are indeed nutty.These would make a great addition to a breakfast routine or a snack for someone who works out, but for the calorie-conscious, they are a bit high.

"I've been lucky (or unfortunate) to review and own a lot of vacuums in the past couple of years. I've always had Hoovers, but I've tried several others (a high-end Samsung, a Bissell) and what I'm learning is that all vacuums are not created equal. I think people just think, ok, it has great suction, so it's a success.  But, there are so many other details that can make or break using each vacuum a pleasant experience.To date, I've not owned a Dirt Devil... anything. My SO has a very awful handheld vac that he uses on his car and the suction that unit provides is abysmal. That being said, I have no feelings on Dirt Devil one way or the other.We have 720SF of space that's 65% hardwood, 25% vinyl flooring and 10% ceramic tile. We also have some area rugs. The majority of our ""dirt"" is bird seed (we have six pet birds), dust and dirt. We vacuum once or twice a week.Right off the bat, I noticed the vacuum is lighter and easier to push around than my others. That's a plus. It's overall smaller than my others and has a narrower head, too. No biggie - we have a small house.The wand/crevice tool is what can make or break a vacuum for me. This one has an easy-to-detach wand and it's long enough, too. Suction is great on the vacuum and with the hose - no complaints there. The hose is easy to attach/detach, which if you've ever used a vacuum with a cumbersome hose attachment (I'm lookin' at you Bissel), you'll know that this matters.Suction is good and it picked up all my birdseed and feathers with ease. The brush bar never shuts off and I'm ok with that. Some people think it can damage hardwood floors, but I've not found it to be a problem on mine. I have actual hardwood floors and have yet to see any damage from my vacuums with always-moving brush bars. Note: there is no height adjustment, however. But, that being said, it goes from hardwood to rug with ease - some of my other vacuums have to actually be lifted up to get them onto my rugs.The many ways one can use this vacuum is nice. There's a dusting pad for walls/ceilings and under beds (which I love) and the canister can be left attached to the vacuum or removed. The amount of attachments provided is sufficient - there's nothing else I need.The canister is easy to empty and the re-usable filter is easy to clean. I do prefer canister over bagged vacuums.The cons are as follows:* The CORD. Once you get used to a vacuum with a retractable cord, you've been spoiled and will curse winding the cord yourself. First world problems, I know. The area where the cord is stored on this vacuum is off to the side on the back. When you're winding it, it's obstructed by the hose that connects to the bottom of the vac, so winding the cord up is a pain. You have to hold the hose out of the way so you can squeeze the cord around the tabs. Also, there's a cord holder midway up the vacuum, but not one at the top, so when you're vacuuming, the cord hangs oddly from the middle of the vacuum. I grab the cord and hold it at the top with the handle, but there really should be a cord clip higher up on the vacuum somewhere.* The attachments are attached kind-of precariously to the unit itself. The crevice tool is loosely attached mid-way up the vacuum and I've knocked it off a few times already while just doing normal vacuuming. The other attachment was VERY hard to get attached to the vacuum.* The unit overall feels a little, er, cheap. It feels wobbly and not sturdy. Some pieces aren't snug and tight. This is probably why the unit feels light and easy to move, though.Out of the FOUR vacuums I now own (yes, four in a house as small as ours), this is my favorite one. Overall, it's the easiest to use, has great suction and those hose/wand does a great job. It's the least stressful out of the four to use!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN7D54COJOCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNKSRYG#wasThisHelpful","RLN7D54COJOCA","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does what it's supposed to do! After my SO plunged out a huge wad of my hair from the shower plumbing, we knew this was a much-needed accessory.Though this does an excellent job of keeping hair out of the drain, some very odd, and gross ""cons"" should be noted:* When you first start the shower, the water hits the protector at such an angle that the cold-ish water splashes your feet. I just stand a little farther back. That cold water is a bit of a shock your system first thing in the morning.* It's disgusting as HELL to clean this out. Since all that gunk isn't going in the drain, you'll want to clear this out, regularly, and if you don't:* Since water will pool a little around this (it will restrict water flow a little bit), you see all the hair that is wrapped around it float away from it while you're showering. It's kinda gross. Every time I turn on the shower and the water hits the protector, the hair ""detaches"" from it and floats around it. It's nasty to look at.The product itself is well-made and sturdy - it won't budge from where you set it. And it does exactly what it sets out to do. However, be aware that all that crap that was previously going into your drain is now going to be wrapped around the protector and will sometimes float away from it while you're showering.So I'm going with four stars since the product itself is stellar, but whether you'll find this to be a beneficial addition to your shower is up to you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229FGQXEFGJXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMFM#wasThisHelpful","R229FGQXEFGJXV","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love all things snack-y. I was excited to try these! When I opened the bag, I though ""huh"" - sure enough they look like half-popped popcorn. I expected them to taste like it, too (burnt, stale, gross), but happily, they did not. They taste like a cross between a CornNut and a PopCorner/ChipIn, both of which I love. The taste is good - crunchy, a little buttery, salty.140 cals for a one ounce serving is about in-line with the calorie count for most carb-based snacks. There's no too many ingredients in these, which I like. Just simple stuff like popcorn, oil. butter, salt and cream. I was happy to see that there are no artificial flavors, preservatives, hydrogenated oils or corn syrup in these, too. Nice.The only struggle I had was eating them. They are pretty small - about pea-sized. So, you can maybe grab a few of them with your fingers. I almost debated eating them with a spoon.

The plastic cover on the front and back had some wear on it, almost like someone had been sliding it in and out of a bookshelf for a few months.I normally love Avery products and was actually in the market for a recipe binder at the time.

"When I opened the VERY LARGE box this came it, I had doubts that all my stuff would fit on this. But it did. It's actually quite large, spanning almost the entire width of my shower. I have to admit, it's rather large and unsightly to look at, but I've gotten used to it.Setup was easy - snap the top over shower and suction the cups on the side. The suction cups click to let you know they've adhered and also feature a tab you pull to remove them. You may actually want to do the suction part when you're in the shower so you can get the cups wet. I did this one day without moisture, and the next day, the cups had un-stuck themselves. **Update: the suction cups have now come un-suctioned twie now, averaging about once a week.** I do love the suction cup idea since my previous shelf had to be weighted accordingly so it wouldn't be off-balance. The suction cups on this shelf mean you can stack all your heavy things on one side and not have to worry.The holes for putting your shampoo bottles upside-down to fill is GENIUS. I loved that! And the slotted floor of the shelf is great, too, so you won't get a build up of sludge like I have in my soap holder.The only very slight ""cons"" are the price ($35 is a lot for a plastic and metal shower rack), the lack of a hook on the bottom (for hanging sponges, etc. - my previous shelf had this) and the sheer size of this thing (it's huge). None of those things are a deal-breaker though. And also, for the love of peter, quit zip-tying things! Those little buggers making getting the product out of its packaging a real chore.

"I still get the occasional pimple, even though I'm in my late 30s. I do not regularly use any sort of facial care products or acne treatments. I just wash my face with soap in the shower and very occasionally use astringent when my face is particularly dirty.This is an interesting product. You WANT the two substances to be separated when you use it - the oily stuff on the top part of the bottle and the creamy stuff on the bottom part of the bottle. Why? I don't know. That's just how you're supposed to use it. I mistakenly shook it up and *then* read the instructions. It's actually kind-of fun to apply.So far, on all the pimples I've used it on, they seem to have reduced by the next day. I have a feeling this would not work on that deep, cystic acne I used to have back in high school. But, this does dry out my small pimples and reduce redness/soreness by the next morning. For my needs, it works. I have maybe 1-2 small-ish pimples during ""that time of the month"" and that's about it. It's not miracle worker, but if your acne is small and not cystic, I can see this working.The only issue I have is that little flakes of it come off when I sleep and I'm getting little chalk-like marks on my dark brown sheets. Not that big of a deal though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10T1MMNR34UGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OE05HIW#wasThisHelpful","R10T1MMNR34UGR","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually like vacuuming. Well, I like it when it doesn't fight me every step of the way. I bought this vacuum based on its high number of reviews and what looked like POSITIVE reviews.After just having the thing fall over on top of me (again) while using the crevice tool, I thought it was time to write my review.The suction is great. No arguments there. And one might say ""isn't that all we need to know?"" After having and reviewing several vacuums (including an expensive Samsung), there are many things that can make or break using vacuums and it wasn't until the last two I reviewed that I felt the need to expand on this. Little things (and a few big ones) really make using this vacuum a real pain in the butt.My biggest gripe is the suction tool/crevice tool, or whatever you want to call it. The hose is VERY stiff which means if you pull on it at all, the vacuum topples over. I use the hose/crevice tool A LOT. It's one of the most important parts of a vacuum cleaner for me. The suction on this one is great, but I often have to lie the vacuum on its side when using it so it doesn't fall over. You can hold the vacuum with one hand and hold the crevice tool in another, but often I need that hand for pulling back curtains, etc. when I'm vacuuming up bird seed along my floor trim. Today, as I was on the floor using the crevice tool, I pulled it ever so slightly and the vacuum came toppling over on me, actually breaking the skin on my leg and causing it to bleed. I've sustained bruises from this vacuum falling on me, but this was the first time the stupid thing actually made me bleed!So, even though the hose can expand a few feet, if your hand isn't on the vacuum holding it still, the vacuum will fall over. The only other solution I can find to this is to lie the vacuum down and drag it along the floor while using the crevice tool; at least that way, you don't run the risk of it falling over.Other minor to moderate annoyances include:* The little nub that holds the cord while you are vacuuming (I don't think some people know where this is - it's above the TurboBrush). You really have to shove the cord into this thing to get it to stay. It doesn't snap into it, it just kinda has to be wedged into it.* Since I have hardwood floors and linoleum, I use the 2nd lowest setting on the dial. This means the brush bar noise on the floor is REALLY loud. Louder than any vacuum I've had so far.* Canister has two areas you'll need to take apart to get debris cleaned out.* The place where the hose attaches into the vacuum just twists in there and is often hard to attach/remove. Like the nub that holds the cord, there's no click or snap, you just wedge it in there.* The location of the power button is poor. You can't turn it on with your foot and you can't reach it standing up.* Cannot go from hardwood to rug without having to lift up the vacuum.Yes, I know it's an $80 vacuum and the suction is good. But if that's all you're after - cheap and good suction - then this is the vacuum for you. If the little things matter and if you vacuum a lot, look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNT0CW311G7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBIZTW#wasThisHelpful","R3VNT0CW311G7G","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WARNING: I'm going to be specific and it's going to be gross. You should know that these results are possible with these pills.A little history: I've been moderately constipated for about ten years now, ever since I quit smoking. I've tried nearly every pill, powder and supplement out there; prunes, Miralax, Super Cleanse for your Colon, Constipation Stop, probiotics (pearls), stool softeners, fiber pills, magnesium, fish oil, Swiss Kriss, that yogurt that makes you poop, Smooth Move tea... you name it, I've tried it. They work, but only for so long. So I just switch up my approach every few months. Saw this product recently and hadn't heard of it before, and the reviews looked positive (though now, they seem suspicious), so I thought I'd give it a try.One last note: this stuff is not for long-term use. In fact, it states not to take it for longer than a week.I thought I would start out strong and take TWO capsules last night. I knew I'd be out and about today, but didn't think it would be that bad. Recommended dosage is 1-2 capsules at bedtime with at least 8 oz. of water. I drank about 16 oz. of water with my two pills. I took the pills about 10pm and within 1.5 hours, I had to poo. Not sure if that was from the pills or not, but the urge was STRONG.Next morning, I had pretty moderate intestinal cramping. I URGENTLY needed to go. I hurried my BF out of the bathroom. The pain was pretty bad. So that's poo #1. Before I left the house to pick up my mom, poo #2 had happened. Both times, intestinal cramping was present and the, er, pooping was, uh, splattery and forceful. Mid-way through our shopping, poo #3. Cramping, again. As I was dropping her off, more cramping and I raced home to have poo #4. So, that's four urgent runs to the bathroom. The intestinal cramping before and during the ""movements"" was pretty bad. Edit: Poo #5. Mild cramping. Pretty much almost diarrhea at this point.The label states not to use if you have abdominal pain, diarrhea or loose stools. Well, I had all of those today after taking this supplement.If you do some research on one of the ingredients called ""cascara sagrada"" you'll see it's a powerful laxative and possibly carcinogenic. The FDA has banned it in use in OTC laxatives, but I've seen it in several of these ""natural"" or herbal remedies. I believe it also used to be in Fiber One bars.At this point, I'm only at one dosage, and the next time I try this, I'll only be taking one pill. I will update after that happens. My advice at this point is to maybe try these out when you can be near a toilet all day, or better yet, don't need to leave the house.Update 01/25/2014: Taking one pill (for me) is the better way to go. The cramping is far less after only taking one pill. It definitely gets things moving, that's for sure. I'll never take 2 pills again!

"I've been using these scissors for several light-duty jobs for a few weeks now. They cut cleanly and easily. They do not feel too tight or too lose. They feel great in your hands - I have what I'd call medium to small hands (adult, female).Almost all of the jobs I did with these scissors were light-duty jobs, so at this point, I can't comment on cutting anything like cardboard. **Edit: finally cut some cardboard with these and they did pretty well. I don't think you could cut very thick cardboard, but for lighter stuff, they worked well.** I'm not used to seeing a lifetime warranty on scissors, but that's kinda cool!For my purposes, these are perfect scissors and this pair is now my go-to for all cutting jobs around the house.

"I am very new to resin casting. Before I bought my first brand of resin, I did my reading and Ice Resin had a lot of good reviews, so that's what I bought. It does seem to be quite pricey compared to other resins (like Castin Craft), but wow, it's awesome stuff. So far, I've made over 40 magnets, some cabochons and some buttons. A lot of them have come out ""frosted"" on top, but I'm learning that has to do with the mold, NOT the resin. If your mold is matte, the cast pieces will be matte. If you need something super shiny, you can brush a thin layer of resin on top once the piece has cured.The resin is really easy to work with and fairly low odor. I use it indoors, pouring my molds in the basement and bringing them upstairs to cure (since my basement remains about 60 degrees). Just measure equal amounts of part A and B, stir slowly for two minutes (making sure to scrape the sides), then let sit for five minutes and then you're ready! The pieces come out CRYSTAL clear (unless your mold has a matte finish). I'm not an expert at getting out the tiny bubbles, but most bubbles can be popped with a pin after you've poured.My only (semi) gripe is the price. Obviously, the bigger container you buy, the more you save. Other than that, I have no complaints! Make sure to wait at least 24 hours before you even THINK of touching it or you'll get fingerprints on it. Kit comes with stir sticks, measuring cups and bottle pours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RR602178W069/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTRUHGE#wasThisHelpful","R3RR602178W069","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally spend this kind of money on space heaters, but I was tired of my Lasko only being able to heat within a two foot radius of itself. I am familiar with the Vornado name, so I took a gamble and bought one for $60.00.The first time I flipped it on, I thought it was broken. It was so quiet. So very quiet. But sure enough, heat was coming out. This is a ""whole room"" heater, so the way in which it heats a room is very different than what I'm used to. I looked at the thermometer in my bedroom (yes, I have an old one hanging on the wall) when I first started it and it was about 71 degrees. Within 20-30 mins, the temperature was rising. I got the temp in the room up to 78 degrees with the heater on it's highest setting (1500 and #7 on the dial). I can't seem to get it go above that, which is OK - 78 is hot enough. My bedroom is 12 x 10, so 120 SF. Obviously, keeping the door closed helps the room heat up better and quicker, and once the heater is off and the door is open, the temperature drops pretty quickly.I tried to heat a portion of my unfinished basement. I built a blanket fort of sorts to try and close off one of the rooms in my all-open basement. I brought the Vornado in my ""fort"" and was able to get the temp from 60 to about 66, but it took a lot longer and never really felt warm down there. No fault of the heater though - I think the expectations were just too high.The item itself looks pretty nice, but it's all plastic on the outside and the front grey grill feels particularly cheap. The item is made in China, as are most things these days. I had secretly hoped that Vornado had kept production in the US, but I knew they likely manufactured these overseas.Pros:* Tip over protection; item shuts off it it's tipped over. Same if it's picked up - it's off until you set it down again.* Very quiet. You can barely hear that it's on.* Does heat a small, enclosed room quickly and evenly - not just the 2 feet around the device.* Nice-looking device - it looks very stylish.Cons:* No timer of any sort. Would have been nice, for this price point, to include a timer so the item would shut off after X hours/minutes.* All plastic components on the outside.* The handle is shallow and hard to grab completely.The ""not sure yet"":* I'm not entirely sure how the 1 - 7 dial works yet. It just seems to maybe control the fan speed, though it's referred to as the thermostat. But, I thought that's what the I, II and III settings were for (750, 1150 and 1500W). Edit: OK, this isn't for fan speed and is a thermostat of sorts. Once your room has reached optimal temperature, dial it back and then heater will go off and on, as needed, to maintain that temp. It's kind of imprecise, but I get what it's trying to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D36VEUCT4GKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB4BQ0G#wasThisHelpful","R1D36VEUCT4GKY","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been wanting a sewing machine for quite some time, but have been intimidated by them for years since I know much of a struggle it was to use my mom's back when I was a kid. Obviously, the times have changed, but sewing machines still seemed more complex than I wanted to deal with.This is the first sewing machine *I've* ever owned. Admittedly, I was intimidated by the thing since I hadn't used a sewing machine in 20+ years. If I ever needed to sew anything, I just did it by hand, or worse, used fabric glue or stitch witchery.Setup was not intuitive to me. But, I muddled through the directions and had it up and ready in less than 20 mins. Keep in mind I'm going into this with no real knowledge or experience. However, I managed to get through the directions, thread the bobbin and then thread, er, the rest of it. Placing the bobbin in the base was always the intimidating part to me. There were parts of the quick reference guide that seemed confusing to me, but I got through it. I struggled with each part of the threading, but still was able to get both done in under 20 mins. The needle threader was something I didn't know existed - I kept thinking ""how I am I going to get that thread through that little hole (manually)?!"" So when I finally figured out that it did it for you, well, I was blown away. LOLI popped in a little fabric square and make myself a free-form pocket. I didn't know what else to make.In reading through the complete instructions, this machine does a lot! I'm pretty impressed. It does twin needle stitching, will allow for cylindrical pieces to be stitched, has bunches of styles of stitches, has a buttonhole making feature, zipper insertion attachment, quilting options and tons more. Maybe this stuff is standard fare, but again, this is all new to me.The quality of the machine seems to be quite good. A lot of plastic, but nothing feels flimsy or breakable. It's got some heft to it and looks like it will hold up for quite some time. The included cover is a nice touch, too. You have everything you need to get started and some additional accessories for things like buttons.I have to say, I'm excited about using this machine and I never thought I'd get stoked about a sewing machine. If you're new to sewing machines, obviously read all the instructions and you'll learn everything this machine does. It seems quite diverse and able to handle just about any sewing job you might throw at it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJDN6QR51XA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNS60AQ#wasThisHelpful","R1AJDN6QR51XA7","A3AYF9CD4PXDJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AYF9CD4PXDJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an Acer TravelMate from 2003 running Windows XP which was in desperate need of a wireless adapter upgrade.  The original onboard adapter was essentially a relic, and the USB adapter I had been using was becoming unreliable.  My biggest concern about upgrading to modern hardware is whether my old machine would even accept or handle such a device.The installation went quickly and much more smoothly than I thought it would.  I had absolutely no issues with the T2U’s installation process.  Despite having a decade-old computer, the wireless adapter interfaced perfectly with my new Linksys dual-band 802.11ac router.  The transfer speeds I’m now getting are incredibly fast and the stability is much improved as well.If the T2U works like this on an ancient Acer XP laptop, I can only imagine how much better it would run on a machine with more current specs.

"This was my first experience casting resin. I used Ice Resin and mixed it exactly, per directions. Waited a day before I popped them out of this mold. After reading obsessively about why all my pieces came out matte instead of shiny, I realized it was the MOLD that caused the problem. The backs (or the tops of the pieces) are glossy and shiny, but every surface that touches the mold has a matte finish. Every piece. There's no way I'm going to buff, polish or re-coat these - I'll just get a different mold.I will say that the pieces popped out easily, even with no mold release used.

"These two products come in a cute, reusable blue and white tin. Although it would have been nice to see some padding/tissue paper in the tin, there was none. And my tin was ever-so-slightly bent.Both products have a touch of shimmer and a nice fruity scent. As someone who normally wears nothing but chapstick all winter, it was a change for me. Every time I wore either product, people would point out my lips! So the shimmer, though subtle, is noticeable. This product (the Kiss of Shimmer) feels like a cross between chapstick and lipstick - maybe a more firm lip gloss, actually.I liked the stick (Kiss of Shimmer) better than the butter, as the butter was more gummy and gelatinous.Both the pigment and scent are minimal and pleasing. I didn't find either to be overwhelming. They smell pretty good.These would make great stocking stuffers or a nice treat for yourself. If you're someone (like me) who doesn't wear makeup, lipstick or like any kind of feeling on your lips, this might not be for you. I don't wear stuff like this normally, and when I had it on, I could feel it and it came off on anything I ate or touched. No fault of the product itself - just not my preference.

"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewHaving tested a lot of wireless keyboards this one from Rii sits closer to the top of their range (the remote bar style model seems to be the top dog with programmable buttons and the IR remote built in) However this style has the more ""hand friends"" curved shape that some might prefer. It's quite a light unit though the plastics do have decent density to them and the keyboard has a reassuring click when keys are pushed it does feel a step up in build.Standard QWERTY layout with an orange FN button this is used to access the top row F keys and activate the air mouse mode (the AltGr key has this function) as well as a few other key presses such as backlight control, Del, home key (for Android) etc. Quite logical and clearly laid out  (USA keyboard). Full backlight on this pad including the media controls at the top these two dials have on the left side the volume/track skip/play and pause on the right the OK button and cursor keys with home/end/page up/down doubled up via the FN button. The two shoulder buttons act just like a normal mouse for L/R clicks with a somewhat larger ""flat"" control pad in the middle you can double tap this to select as well.Onto the actual performance nothing to complain about here because the keys are responsive and firm and the track pad is accurate but it is smaller than a laptop touch pad so you might want to adjust the pointer speed it worked well for me though during testing. What makes this stand out a bit is the ""air mouse"" activate this and you can directly control the cursor by moving the pad around in your hands you don't usually get this on a small hand held keyboard and it's very useful particularly for Android TV boxes or media computers not to mention presentations.Charging is via the top micro USB port it takes a couple of hours to go from flat to full no information on the battery size though the back light will hit it a bit even so I've been testing this all week and the battery seems to be quite good endurance wise. Range was approx. 8 metres clear line of sight pretty good compared to some models I have tried and I didn't have any obvious signal loss. Quickly touching on the 3.5mm audio jack this allows you to connect headphones, and there is a built in microphone. The microphone arguably the most useful addition if you are using Viber/Skype or VOIP software this will prove invaluable and saves the hassle of connecting up a separate one. The microphone is located top right below the control pad so it won't get covered by accident I had no problems getting this to work on the Win 10 pc and Android box I used it's more than up to the job subject to the touchpad being held reasonably close (ie normal sitting position)Any areas I would change? Well this is more expensive than some lower models but it does offer the air mouse function and audio out/built in microphone so it depends on what you're after if you need those extras it could save the hassle of picking up an air mouse or microphone. Potential weaker points the back cover which houses the nano USB receiver it doesn't give access to the battery I would like to have an easy way to change the battery. That said this is a fine higher end mini keyboard and has some very useful extras included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD5HM2N0LEKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ0B8G6#wasThisHelpful","R3CD5HM2N0LEKH","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The supplier sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal view***Geartist GB01 Wireless Bluetooth Car Kit FM Transmitter***I've looked at a few of these FM radio Bluetooth devices and the vary in form factor, this offering has a cable with a USB connector and includes a ""twin port"" car charger to power the device and gives you a spare USB port. Installation is simple enough, find a good location for the circular control panel (ie within reach of the driver) attach the supplied 3M backed plastic pad and it holds the unit in place with a magnet. You can use either USB port on the car charger (one is marked 1 amp and one 2 amp output)The unit flashes when pairing up just add ""GB01"" to your Bluetooth phone, all you need to do next is tune it into the radio frequency (pick one that's not near to a radio frequency for obvious reasons) Controls are very simple some dual functions for the buttons play and pause doubles as call answer and reject, the track forward/back also acts as the volume up/down (long press for this)Call quality was good and subject to sensible placement of the unit the speech was clear, as with any device like this you can pick up a bit of background noise, the microphone was better than most I've used to date. In terms of ""audio quality"" whilst a direct Bluetooth connection will give better sound output, this is close enough that most won't really notice and I was quite pleased with the music output. This also supports Sir if you are an Apple user.Couple of areas where this unit stands out a bit more than some others, the construction is solid with metal trimming on the charger and on the main unit, and the cable quality is also better a thicker more durable cable which is nice to see. The magnetic base is also strong (just make sure to clean the surface and pick a flat spot for the plastic pad) this holds in place very well and won't fall off with a slight knock. User manual is clear and easy to follow too.Not much to nit pick with on this (display is quite bright possibly could be toned down a little), also it might be an idea to have clearer markings for the USB ports power rating (the amps are stamped into the case) not that easy to see but it is well made with a metal rim around the top; a very minor point though and bar that it's near enough ideal for a Bluetooth FM kit in terms of features and performance.

It's not for DIY or larger screws the biggest tips are fine for opening plugs but not for door handles or hinges you'll want a bigger set for that type of work.All the parts are housed is a decent quality case this has a spring loaded flip up action and a secure push lock at the front. The main handle has a screw collar for locking the pieces in and a rotating back part (the grey section at the back) this is useful for speed as you won't have to release your grip fully to turn it each time. Two extensions are included the longer metal one slits inside the main handle with the tip being magnetic to hold the bit it also provides a magnetic grip on the screw (you can put the bits directly into the handle but it's not magnetic if you do this) as you can adjust the length it's best to use this. Second one is also magnetic but has a flexible stem making it easy to get into odd angles (it's about 12.5cm long)Quality overall is good for the price vastly better than some of the bargain discount shop offerings the tips seem well machined and more than up to the job - it's not Teng tools but it's not flimsy or weedy in any way. Handle and extension are well designed and comfortable to use. The case is pretty strong with thicker plastics and when you close it up there are mouldings on the top to prevent the bits from moving around. One area I would change in the design is to have a smaller opening for the tip slots this would hold them in place firmly if you drop this box when it's open they will come out. On the back is a plastic tab to hang it and it works but it could be a bit more meaty in construction. Both of these points are fairly minor though this is a great little set and one that will prove extremely useful for many users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S202557M5PYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PA2M0HY#wasThisHelpful","R2S202557M5PYG","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another Curren watch I added to my collection, this one features quite a striking ""tan"" strap with black satin case I rather like the look simple but contrasts very nicely.The strap feels quite firm and strong though it says ""genuine leather"" I suspect it's part leather the outside is finished in a ""suede"" effect which does feel like the real thing. Bit stiff though with time the strap might soften up a little at least it's not flimsy and quite unlikely to break. Case feels fairly solid, single crown no date here the displayed chronograph is for looks only not functional. The ""8"" number stands out something a bit different quite easy to read the time on this and the hour and minute hands are glow in the dark, a red second hand works well with the colour scheme. Back cover has engravings on it too.Looks are akin to a more ""outdoor"" type watch, so far working fine though I'm not sure how the painted case will hold up to use, For the modest asking price it's a nice watch and unusual looking without being a too controversial. Splash resistant so make sure you don't submerse it in water it should survive the odd downfall or accident.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXXTRVZK7ODC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBN7YIW#wasThisHelpful","R2WXXTRVZK7ODC","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these to cut down some sim cards, you can use normal full sized sim card or micro sim cards (you'll need to use the adapter to fit it to the cutter properly for this size) You get the supplied adapters if you need to use the bigger sim sizes again simply slot the card in once it's cut.On the underside you'll see the direction to insert the sim with the angled notch facing the rear, this leaves the ""gold contacts"" showing underneath with the small hole, you can't really go wrong but take care with micro sim cards to ensure they are fitted to the adapter correctly. Use a flat surface a quick swift push down ""punches"" out the sim card. Nano sim cards are tiny they are barely larger than the contacts, I've used this a few times and it's worked pretty well. Saying that an ""out of the box"" sim is cleaner cut but the main point here is that it works.

"I picked this up for the kitchen and just wanted a small timer I could attach to the fridge or use free standing.Despite being small the display is quite clear (larger numbers are 2cm high) and the viewing angles are good too.Doesn't get much easier for controls set the minutes and seconds with the two smaller buttons and the larger one starts/stops the timer. To count up just reset it to 0 (hold both the min/sec buttons) it counts down when a time value is set (99min 59s max)Power is via a single LR44 button battery cell.

"If you're on the look out for a slow burning drama which is completely different this might hit the mark for some viewers, but the attempt at making an entire film misfires in a few places not the fault of the cast or crew I would add.Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke a construction manager due to oversee a huge project early in the morning. However Ivan heads off in his car and starts a long drive; during the trip we see him uncover problems with his marriage and conflicts with work and questions over his future direction in both work and his relationships/family. That is basically the story without spoiling what unfolds during the 85 minutes more is revealed during the drive piece by piece.Bar Hardy entering his car at the start the entire film is shot in the vehicle and the supporting cast are only heard never seen this is a one man show taken to the extreme for a film production whilst this puts a lot of pressure on Hardy's performance it also uncovers some weaker elements with the story which could leave some viewers disappointed in the lack of pace or conclusion to the film. Credit has to be given to Hardy he carries his role well and is entirely believable as Ivan and he laps the role up easily if you wanted an intense actor trailer this would be ideal - but we're watching a film and there are times you feel detached from the events.Supporting cast even though they are only heard are up to the job too Ruth Wilson plays his Wife Katrina, Olivia Colman as his former lover/one night stand and Andrew Scott puts a perky performance in as one of the men working for Ivan. Ben Daniels and Tom Holland also have supporting roles too. I can't fault any of the acting in any way all do a fine job and more than I would have expected (not having a visual cue might make it quite a hard task voice acting isn't that easy)A nod has to go to Haris Zambarloukos the Cinematographer; what a nightmare for anyone shooting the film one man a car and that's it you have very little variation in scenes. He succeeds in holding some attention during the film some wider night shots driving, close up shots of Hardy and the control console where he's scrolling though the on-board phone numbers he keeps it as fresh as you can during the near hour and a half run.Where the film fails for me is a few areas the storyline whilst it's quite a good one doesn't reach a satisfactory conclusion there is an event near the end but we never see him leave the car or meet anyone else. It's also unlikely to bear repeat viewings very well as you will not only know the story but the visuals as good as Haris has tried to make them offer little variations for viewers there isn't a lot of chance you'll spot something you missed first time it's dialogue heavy (though moments where Hardy is silent he does that well too) Perhaps over ambitious and trying a bit hard to be off the beaten path possibly worth a look.After 20-30 minutes you'll know if the film is for you if not it will quickly get the off button. The story needs more work and I also think that it was a mistake to have it limited only to the car this hugely limits the scope of audience interest and it really needed some segments out of the car and some visual connection to the other actors at least a little. I blame the director/writer Steven Knight he boxed himself into a corner and didn't allow himself room to move trying to play the ""oddball"" card with a single extended scene was risky and in my view has not really worked. It has lots of potential but it will divide viewers I can't really call it a satisfying watch even though I admired the cast and performances. You can only work with what you have; here there isn't that much to work withI'm puzzled it got such critical acclaim I'm giving this 3 purely for the acting which is excellent as a story it's a 2/3 out of 10 some viewers might love it many will hate it","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27W0BTODMBJ49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MN64NZW#wasThisHelpful","R27W0BTODMBJ49","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a few of these watches from Ohsen (quite impressed with this maker tried various models no problems to date)This one comes with a few case colour variations from black to red/blue/white etc. Bar the makers name the model is: 2810A straight forward watch in many ways main time setting can be in 12/24 hours, the day/date are shown too. Next up is a stop watch with split times available, an alarm set mode which also allows you to set the hourly chime if you wish, lastly the time setting you'll know when you are in this as the number flash as do the two small dials on the top/mid left. Case is mostly plastic resin but feels quite strong and dense with a strap that matches the look it's reasonably thick with lots of spacing holes so getting a good fit is quite easy with this model.Stainless steel case back with it has WR to 5ATM marked on it I've not been swimming with this but it has no problems with a shower or bath or rain. One slightly gimmicky but attractive area is the ability to change the backlight colour you simply press and hold light button and it cycles though the various colours blue, red, purple, green, cyan, yellow and a special ""psychedelic"" one which flashes rapidly showing all the colours it's a bit distracting for me but I do like the ability to change the backlight colour. As a normal digital only watch it's solid and has the chunky look some like quite a nice model and another decent offering from Ohsen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B80NAWGFQXPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UQWRWO#wasThisHelpful","R1B80NAWGFQXPW","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:59 MinsNote: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewPriced a little above entry models this one from Tendak offers a few extra features over lower priced models. Whilst all dash cams have wide angle lenses some are 140 degree this one has a wider 170 degree field of view as well as a build in LED light (useful if you dismount the camera to take video/stills)In the box are the camera (16GB card is included) + mount, manual, a long car lead for power (will easily reach a rear window on most cars) and a mini USB lead plus a lens cloth. The mount can be adjusted in both directions so it's possible to angle it around too which could prove quite handy many cameras have only an up/down adjustment.The included manual does a decent job in most ways of explaining how to use the camera but I did find the illustration of the controls way too small that needs looking at but it's a small point it's pretty easy to work this via the controls which are on both sides of the camera. You do have a HDMI output too if you want to plug it into a TV for playback.With any dash camera it helps to have one that just plugs in and works at the default settings with minimal user intervention. Pleased to report the Tendak did very well here with no real adjustments needed accurate exposure, white balance in daytime and night driving were close to ideal in a variety of conditions; you won't need to hit the settings menu unless you want to adjust say the clip intervals or resolution.Notes:Video can be recorded in HD 1920 x 1080 @30fps or 1280 x 720 @30 or 60fps no standard definition options3 compression settings for video footageA 3 minute clip recorded at full HD will use about 400MB of card space; supports up to 32GB micro SD card sizeYou can take still images (though like most cameras higher resolutions are interpolated) quality was respectable enough for a camera in this price rangeExposure and white balance can be user adjustedTime/date stamp can be imprinted on footageMost of the options you need are here including the option to set clip lengths or turn it off, G sensor and the motion detection (this activates with movement in front of the camera handy if it's parked) The camera responded well to starting stopping without having to adjust any of the sensitivity options start the engine and drive off it consistently picked this up and commenced recording (some cameras need a tweak here)Footage quality was excellent with lots of details in daylight and this was maintained in lower light too without a big drop in frames or over processing on footage. Very little to fault here though a little highlight loss in very harsh light. Top end models do a little better in very dark conditions (this did well though) and you do get more snazzy features like GPS and lane warnings. As a mid ranger this impressed me in terms of the package (decent mount and the included card isn't something you always see) I have used some models that were easier to pick up controls wise as the buttons are on the side it's a little less intuitive but reasonably easy after a short time using it. I'd like the option to punch in a vehicle registration number a small point but at least you can imprint the time and date on footage. One area that stood out not all dash cameras let you adjust the compression settings this can help save card space and is useful for longer trips this model has 3 levels and even the lowest yields decent footage.The most important areas are well covered great default settings, very good video quality if you just want a plug it and go dash cam with minimal fussy or fiddling this is one of the better models I've used and comes with a recommendation","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWV7RY5NWJDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HU5QOU#wasThisHelpful","R1YWV7RY5NWJDZ","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The agent supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the production is my own personal viewI previously looked at the Pyle brothers China biking adventure and found it very enjoyable (as a non biker) For this trip the Pyle Bros drop their BMW Motorrad bikes and gear up with a pair of Royal Enfield bikes (this is the Indian arm of Enfield that bough the rights to the British makers name) hand made custom bikes the guys are using a well known Indian based manufacturer for their mammoth journey. Their route takes them 14,000 km around the country (the China one was a little longer) it's still a huge ride though and one with many challenges including some very poor weather and road conditions they encounter.The episodes are split into 6 segments of 30 minutes each and I'm pleased to say the editing is a big improvement on the prior instalment. Not easy to edit down what is probably many hours of footage into 2.5 hours of viewing and I think the production team have done a good job on this. At the start of each 30 minute episode you get a quick recap on the prior events (not too long and unlike the China one they don't recap all the way back just a few minutes of what went on in the last episode compressed into highlights)Blu ray transfer is to a high level lots of details though a few blowouts at times in harsher lighting. A mix of action camera and from the crew cameras it's well edited for the most part. As you'd expect with such a long trip there are problems (India's roads leave quite a lot to be desired) and the driving conditions in some of the populated areas (Mumbai - also known as Bombay) is quite shocking massive traffic jams and dangerous driving mean even urban rides in this trip are fraught with danger. Two areas I enjoyed (as a non biker) the cultural side to the country and some stunning vistas from the rugged northern mountains to hot desert areas and flash flooding in places too. Weather conditions vary significantly as it's such a large country this presents some challenges for the team. Mechanical problems are par for the course and yes you do get moments where the brothers get down and this is shown clearly. This is a tough ride a little bit of moaning is going to happen they're only human anyone doing a 14k ride isn't likely to do that with a big smiley face through the entire trip! It's hands on and real there isn't any obvious camera play going on here you just see it as it happens good moments and harder ones; that's part of the appeal of the series.For the most part it's a slick production with some experience from previous trips under their belt they've refined and honed the final production and it shows. If there were any areas to improve I'd say that whilst 2.5 hours seems quite long it's maybe over a little quickly for me I'd have loved to see another couple of episodes included though appreciate editing might not be easy. If you're a biker fan you'll love it no question there but even if you're not the journey reveals some spectacular scenery and insight into the customs and cultures of India which is a very unique country.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B24FW6D2IYU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH1LFSU#wasThisHelpful","R1B24FW6D2IYU0","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for a second desktop computer and to take with a laptop if required.This version only came out a few months ago and is the ""HS4"" model which is an update on the previous ""HS3"" card reader. Cable length is 1.1 metres it's a micro USB 3.0 connection on the back. Top panel has the ""Kingston"" logo which glows/flashes red when data is being transferred.There are a few minor differences the M2 slot is now gone if you are using these smaller MS cards you can use an adapter for the MS slot to read them; Kingston seem to be taking an approach were legacy cards are not supported (M2, XD etc) for most users not a problem just bear that in mind if you use those older cards you might want to try another card reader.The older model could read from the UHS II SD cards though not at the full speed, this one has the additional contacts to read at full speed from these newer cards; so you'll need to push the card in a bit further v the older model. Also UDMA 7 reading speeds are here (older one was up to UDMA 6) These differences are not huge and most of the changes are cosmetic with a white case and grey brushed metal case it's a well made but light card reader (rubber pads on the underside could be a bit softer though for improved surface grip) Performance was a bit quicker than the HS3 reader around 8-10% faster though both card readers do well on performance reading and writing.OS support is Windows (working fine with Win 10), Mac OS X, Linux and ChromeA great little card reader if you're looking for a new on this is the model to go for, if you have the older one unless you need the UDMA 7 and UHS II SD speeds there is little to gain upgrading to this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JPZUT1T93A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAGX6MW#wasThisHelpful","R39JPZUT1T93A6","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this card as a reasonable compromise between capacity and cost (the very fast cards are quite expensive at this size) and 128GB ones even more so, these however are do have faster performance than the older generation cards.Samsung appear to be offering this model in addition to the entry ""Blue"" and ""Orange"" cards both are reasonable speed wise though not particularly fast for write times (the Orange EVO is about 15MB/s or a little over that) On paper Samsung quote ""80MB/s"" but that's the transfer speed (read)In testing I found the speeds to be (on a USB 3.0 card reader):Read: 78-82 MB/sWrite: 21-23MB/sA little variation between tests but not much. That's a pretty good read speed as fast as many cards at the top end almost (some hit 90MB's just) write speeds are about 5-6MB/s over the lower down EVO that's a respectable write performance though not ultra fast still satisfactory enough for many users.Taking the price point into consideration I'm pretty happy overall it's a fair cost for a larger capacity and performs well enough for most users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MJLP7KQ88GP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XE5XFIM#wasThisHelpful","R3MJLP7KQ88GP9","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this in addition to my 35mm dedicated film scanner so I could provide better quality ""print scans"" and deal with larger format scanning.This is a fairly sizeable scanner about 48cm long by 28 wide, though more manageable than the higher end models from Epson. The spec on this is very much the V600 minus the Photoshop Elements though at a slightly better price.In the box is a quick start guide, film holders for Medium format and 35mm slides/negatives, a normal length USB cable (if you plan to have the scanner some distance from the desk then an extender cable is necessary) and a good length power cable (figure of 8 connector with a fairy compact power brick.Installation went without issue on a 64bit Windows 10 PC this is also Mac compatible.There are a number of ""extras"" on the disc these are not essential for normal scanning but add additional functions:Abbyy FineReader 9.0 - This gives you OCR (optical character recognition) for scanning documents and editingEasy Photo Scan - A simplified scan suite which has basic adjustments (exposure, cropping, colour, b&w/sepia etc) and designed to upload files to social media sites; Facebook, Picasa, EvernoteArcsoft ""Scan ' Stitch"" - This software lets you scan larger posters or non standard sizes putting them together to create a single output file.Copy Utility - This allows you to use the scanner like a photo copier outputting the results directly to the printer, if you have an all in one printer it's probably not requiredMost of the software is useful, though you might not use it frequently it's worth keeping the disc around. More experienced users might pass on the Easy Photo Scan as you have various modes on the normal Epson scan utility.Onto the scanner, markings indicate where to load the trays with a top removable white cover on the inside (you need to remove this for film scanning) The trays are quite flexible though pay attention to the covers that clip in they are there to hold the film flat and need to click into place.On the side the power button and a bank of 4 quick scan options, a capable scanner for documents but more suited to film scanning.The main Epson scan software is fairly easy to follow with 4 main modes:""Full Auto"" - Very few options to adjust on this you can set the DPI (up to 1200 on the film mode) and specify a document or film scan, dust removal or restoration and photo orientation.""Home Mode"" - This gives you more settings and an easy to see drop down menu for the scan type (film type b&w etc, document, newspaper and text, you have more control over the DPI, can specify ICE/Backlight correction and you get a preview""Office Mode"" - Dedicated options for document scanning with descreening options, text enhancement, specific sizes etc. If it's not a photo this is the mode to be in""Professional Mode"" - You have access to advanced settings for both document and film scanning including levels, colour correction, fine control over every parameter, bit depth, high resolutions, ICE, software dust removal, grain reduction, unsharp mask the whole hog is in this section as well as the settings for document scans.To start off I would suggest the ""Home Mode"" this is suitable for both text and film scans and you have control over most of the important functions of the scanner.***Notes & Film Scanning Strategy***Digital ICE is a hardware based Infrared technology and it works well for dust/scratch removal on most film, however it doesn't work effectively on black and white silver halide film (the silver particles interfere with the Infrared) and it doesn't work well with Kodachrome; this is due to the specific film in Kodachrome which has a separate Cyan layer which degrades the Infrared (this is just this specific film not slide film in general). In both cases you can use the software dust removal which is fairly effective (3 levels low to high)USM: Unsharp mask this is a critical setting on a film scanner and has a significant impact on scan results. Off with yield soft images that require sharpening later on, medium and high will be suitable for direct printing. The low setting seems like a reasonable compromise allowing some scope for sharpening later on without over sharpeningGrain Reduction: Very effective but it also has potential to remove details too (the presence of grain is a natural part of film) use at the lower settings to maintain good resolution, noise/grain can be removed later on after the scan.Colour restoration: Attempts to rejuvenate faded prints/film though will wreak havoc with normal photos it's quite good but make sure it's off unless the film is faded/desaturatedBacklight correction: Boosts exposure significantly if the image is underexposed, film will show more grain and lower levels of detail only use it for underexposed images as a quick fix.Image type: 48 bit has a high depth suitable for image editing later on use in combination with TIFF files, for more direct results 24bit and low compression jpegs are still suitable for some adjustment later on. TIFF files are huge, but have a large scope for adjustments. You also have options for 16bit and 8 bit greyscale, the former being preferable for images the 8bit perfectly fine for text/most documentsResolution: Consider what you are scanning and how you are going to use the images. For highest quality archival film scans then use a higher setting (the actual optical resolution on film scanners is never the headline figure) Medium format will benefit from higher resolution settings for print output, 35mm film is somewhat harder to scan but good results are possible if you adjust the settings to suit. For example there is little point in scanning old 35mm film taken on a plastic lens camera with ultra high resolution the image just won't have that much detail, on the other hand a good lens and emulsion can yield high details even on 35mm scans a sensible ""normal scan"" for a good printable image will be around 3200 DPI giving an approx. 12 megapixel image, 2400DPI will still be able to deliver a good A4 size print (just over 6 megapixels) if not a bit more. Don't scan 35mm film at 6400 DPI unless it's something amazing resolution wise (Adox with a Leica/Zeiss lens)Higher resolutions take longer to scan, adding ICE and grain reduction all add to scan times. Speed wise it's reasonable (comparable to my Plustek) but slows down significantly. DMAX (dynamic range) is good you will rarely have problems with the exception of Kodachrome which is a difficult film to scan (high density) I would aim for a neutral slightly flat exposure on the scans this film is unique in that it is hard work for most scanners (even high end professional ones) the Epson does fairly well. To my surprise the Epson did hold up to my Plustek with resolution despite this being a flat bed scanner v a dedicated 35mm one. But the settings are quite important the Plustek applies quite a bit of sharpening by default, the Epson really does need a setting of at least ""low"" for Unsharp mask.The scanner surprised me in some ways the end result/performance, though I would prefer slightly more robust holders (it might be worth picking up an extra set to load up whilst you are scanning) Even without any image editing software (there are some open source ones around that can help, those who have Lightroom will find that well suited to tweaking) Epson's suite is fairly good though it could use a makeover for the layout.Make no mistake this is a capable scanner whilst it's not quite as high end as the next model up (higher DMAX, consider this for difficult scans) it can punch up with dedicated 35mm scanners in terms of resolution and dynamic range. This model has several important features over the models below it, ICE is worth the extra price alone... if you are looking for good printable results from the scanner the increased features make this ideal for film users who need to scan various sizes of film you also benefit from better print scanning too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340H3WCDJ6YCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1O74SW#wasThisHelpful","R340H3WCDJ6YCR","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version is the updated II type which is optically the same as the I model a newer micro motor is present (it's a little faster) and I don't find it very noise though it isn't silent either. This gives an equivalent full frame. field of view of 18-26mm on a 1.6x crop body (ie Canon)Build is something Tokina have a good reputation for at that's mirrored here metal casing with chunky rubber grips on the zoom and focus ring, metal mount as expected and a smooth zoom/focus action. This lens uses a ""one touch"" focus pull the ring back for manual focus or push it forward for normal AF; I find it works quite well though it might take some getting used to.The main appeal of this lens is two fold firstly it's unusual to have an F2.8 lens for such a wider angle, this would be quite useless though if the lens were optically poor at such an aperture. Good news is that even at F2.8 from 11-16mm the images are very usable with excellent sharpness in ""most"" of the image area, there is some drop off of sharpness in the extreme corners and edges but not horribly so (not mushed out just softer) stopping down to around F4 improves things with F5.6 really stepping it up. In short for ""printable"" results (even at fairly large sizes) F2.8 is usable and you shouldn't hesitate to do so in dimmer conditions. For normal daylight stop down as usual though there is little to gain going below F8Supplied petal hood fits on securely and is well made it can be reversed though this will block much of the focus ring area. This is a lens which does benefit from using it as there are a couple of weaker areas with the lens. Distortion is well controlled a simple mild curve which is easy to correct.There are a few drawbacks firstly flare can be visible with the sun or bright light sources (lens produces decent sun starts at smaller apertures) other than using the hood or a hand to block stray light there isn't a lot you can do about it. I don't find it a big issue for most shooting conditions it has improved a bit since the Mk I version (new coatings) Second weakness is CA this can be visible at all apertures though more so at the faster ones it doesn't entirely clear up stopping down, this has a distinct ""purple"" line which tends to show up around higher contrast edges (not always but it's there in with strong highlights) This is relatively easy to remove in post processing even using the auto correction in PS/LR. Min focus isn't anything to rave about (1:11.6) less of an issue as it's for a crop body you can get to about a foot from a subject in the real world still close enough to provide some wild dramatic shots.A few uses for this lens bar obvious landscape work (it's quite a hard lens to use for this type of shot as foreground is very important) Interior shots are ideal for this lens the faster aperture means you can if required use the lens hand held (tripod is better but you can work it at F2.8) you can get a lot of room into photos with the lens. Wedding another possibility with the faster lens speed available light shooting is realistic. An UWA lens is something of a specialty but also can be quite rewarding it can give a dramatic view that normal lenses can't and it's certainly one that deserves a place in the bag here you get lens speed and sharpness trading a shorter zoom range (it's only 5mm but it's a big difference between the two but at 16mm you are still wide). For owners of the Mk I version there isn't any obvious reason to upgrade to the II model they have the same optical formula just the motor is improved a little and the coatings.For me the stronger points outweigh the weaker ones it's a must have lens for any crop body shooter","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10K6HS1XJKIX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ORXEIW#wasThisHelpful","R10K6HS1XJKIX9","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis set came supplied with a micro USB charging cable, a clip for the flat cable and 3 sets of ""stabilisers/retainers"" (to help hold the earpieces in the ear) and 2 different sizes of silicone tips. You do need to get a good fit on these and seal the tip to get a strong vibrant sound so play around with the tips to get the ideal fit.Build is good solid plastic these are 3cm in depth from the tips to the back of the case above average however the sound output is also more ""beefy"" than many sets I've listened to. 3 main buttons on the controls the central one power on/off and play/pause as well as call answering with the usual skip buttons dealing with volume and track selection (short presses for volume long ones for tracks)Takes about 2 hours to charge from flat and I got about 5.5 hours playback and normal volume levels that's better than many sets I've used. Bluetooth range was around 8 metres clear line of sight. As the microphone is on the panel it's quite close to your mount and it picked up speech clearly.Onto the sound quite a lot of action in the bass department it's smooth but deep and not too laid back of thumpy either. Mids and highs a little less emphasis but the balance was quite good with a crisp clean sound these buds do hit the mark on this level. Soundstage was also good a closer presence it feels direct and I like it though it's better suited to pop/rock and other tracks though a quick tweak on the EQ yields good results on acoustic songs too.This is one set of buds where you do have to fit the silicone retainers to grip the outer ear sections I don't mind the extra length. A few nice features including the ability to pair to two phones at the same time and a battery level on iOS devices, and a cable clip that lets you take up the slack on the flat cable; being sweat proof makes them well suited to sports or outdoor activities . A nice set and recommended for those who like a more potent bass output.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE4BNFNZYBFAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129WK7TA#wasThisHelpful","RE4BNFNZYBFAO","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal view(I don't accept payment for reviews I give honest opinions this isn't a 5 star wow review)You get a supplied USB cable with this keyboard it has a male connection, female port (to allow you to plug the nano receiver in) and the mini USB plug built in, this allows you to charge the keyboard from the same cable and avoiding the need to unplug the receiver (handy if you are using a console or Android box)The keyboard is 26cm wide by just over 18cm, all the keys are flat with a touchpad to the right and brushed metal finish on the underside (this also has an area to store the nano receiver) and two rubber pads. Back section has the mini USB port and on/off switch and two LED's one blue when it's on and the other a low battery red LED (this also glows red when charging and goes out when complete) Standard USA qwerty layoutTouchpad serves a few functions firstly you can single or double finger tap for the left/right mouse functions (this is duplicated on the far less with buttons), or for just moving the cursor around. It can also be used to ""scroll"" pages with two fingers held drag them across the touch pad at the same time.This will work with a PC (from XP onwards), Mac, Linux and Android devices too as well as consoles though some of the functions might not match. It's possible to access the media and shortcuts by pressing the ""Fn"" button (marked blue) with the other dual function buttons along the top and cursor keys etc. I found the keyboard to be well made with a solid feel the keys are also slightly raised on the F and J button this is to help touch typists but as one myself it's obviously not as easy to touch type on a smaller keyboard though it's possible with some adjustment.I found the range to be about 5-6 metres, if you are using other wireless devices like mice bear in mice you might want to check the channels they are using. A few places I'd modify though this isn't backlit which would be nice though likely to eat the battery a bit more (doesn't take long to charge about 90 minutes from flat), a way to turn off the touchpad might be useful too. Quality is good though the style and design are attractive and as good as you would hope for a keyboard of such small dimensions. Plug and play as all RF devices are this worked just fine on the Android box I used it on and a Windows PC you might want to tweak the mouse speed as this is linked to the touch pad.It's a nice keyboard though I see it being used mainly for TV boxes (which are a pain with normal remotes particularly for text input) possibly some tablet users will find a use for it. Worth considering if you want the compact size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGM0029CELVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESUXXZM#wasThisHelpful","RTGM0029CELVU","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewAt just over 3"" by 2"" this tiny speaker has a very nice ""soft touch"" finish to the exterior and it adds to the quality tactile feel. Controls are very basic as you'd expect; A power button on the side, +/- buttons to select tracks (short press) long ones to change the volume with the play button for pause/play and call answering. You get a small strap, Aux 3.5mm jack and micro USB charging cable with this.On the underside is a rubber flap covering the micro USB port and Aux input. Pairing worked well with a range of around 8 metres, charging takes a few hours from flat and it managed just over 6 hours at mid volume levels pumping it out at the max will shorten that quite a bit but even lower levels will yield longer play times, that's well above average for a speaker this size. No problems with the microphone either subject to being a reasonable distance from the speaker it worked well.I didn't expect much for the sound on this speaker it's small and has a 3 watt speaker, but it seems to be using the underside grill to boost the bass frequencies when placed on a flat surface and it works rather well. Sound is very good for such a small speaker clean and crisp with no obvious distortion to date one of the best sounding units I've tested in this class (size) Very little to fault with the speaker it's water resistant, good battery life and sound plus it looks ""good"" too.

"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThe model I looked at is the larger capacity 16500mAh/600A version this is capable of staring larger engines (a handy guide to approx starting power required for engine sizes is on one side of the case central divider) In this kit you get a nylon reinforced zip case with hand strap which includes:- The power bank rated to 16500mAh- Jump start clamps (insulated the jaws have a no contact casing around them)- Micro USB lead for charging phones/tablets etc- Lead for plugging in the ""8"" supplied laptop/power connectors- Home power 3 pin charger/adapter and a car chargerTo ""jump start"" a car open the rubber flap and just plug in the jump leads (fool proof design you can't reverse polarity on the power bank) It can do this via capacitors that are built into the unit to store the required current (like a flashgun) power it on and connect the leads to the battery terminals. The Front panel has a fast charge 2.1 amp USB output you can either plug in the supplied micro USB cable or use your own (Apple etc). On the left front the output port for powering laptops here you plug the single lead in and pick the required adapter plug: press the ""power button"" quickly to select the voltage for this output 12/16/19 volts as a safety feature the voltage can't be change with a lead plugged in to avoid damage to a device.Next to the power button are 4 LED's to indicate the charging status/capacity of the battery. A single input for the 2 chargers is provided, this will take overnight to charge via the 15 volts wall adapter (from flat) but you can easily top up the battery as required. Front has a white LED torch this is quite bright and more than enough output to see clearly with 3 modes here each selected by long pressing the ""power button"" for a few seconds a continuous torch, SOS flashing and a continuous flashing mode. There is a larger red panel on the top to start the flashing mode on this a quick double press.A few reasons these ""jump start"" power banks are becoming quite popular – you can toss the jump leads out once you have this it's far easier and more convenient to connect this to start a car/van then messing around trying to drive up close enough to get a connection with the traditional leads. Secondly this also doubles as a portable ""power bank"" capable of charging phones, tablets and even laptops thanks to a connector and tips which are also included. At 16500mAh this requires a fairly long charge overnight (around 13 hours if not a bit more) but you can top it up at any time.Areas I liked: The supplied case makes it easier to put all the leads and cables back in compared to a hard shell plastic ones some come with (small point here) Rubber feet are on the bottom of the battery case helping it grip a surface the build feels quite good for day to day use I can't see it being a problem (I do like the shock proof casings on power banks and it would suit this product well).Could be improved: Instructions are passable but could benefit from a few more diagrams and a bit of translation work it's not hard to operate this but the manual could be a little better. The micro USB cable is handy to have but I prefer the “4 in 1” connector that has the mini/micro/apple connectors.In conclusions minor points aside this is a very useful starter/power bank which as a package makes it's a must have for most motorists. Not only can you get rid of the jump leads you have an emergency light/hazard warning and if you're caught out for juice on a phone/tablet/laptop you have that covered too. A strong recommendation for this one particularly if you need the extra power capacity for larger vehicles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSVXNTSJXBB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE5Q132#wasThisHelpful","R3PSVXNTSJXBB5","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal view.Box contents: Tracker, User manual, mini screwdriver, and micro USB charging cableAt around 5cm by 5cm this small compact unit is a robust little device the outer casing has a good quality soft touch effect to it, with additional dust and water sealing on the port cover/buttons and the top section which can be removed via 4 screws to fit the sim card.This is one product where you do want to read the manual not because it's difficult to get started or up and running, but you need to know the ""commands"" to control the settings (which is done via SMS) This takes a normal sized sim card, if you have a smaller one then you'll need an adapter. All you need is some credit (if it's pre paid) or a live contract card.Once you insert a sim card the system can be powered on this takes about 30-40 seconds to boot up and get a lock on the network signal/GPS. A blue LED flashes to let you know it's locked on. To find the location of the device you can call or text the number of the sim card used, you get a text back telling you the locations in coordinates, battery status and speed (if any) a link is in the message you can just open this with a browser (or use the installed maps on your phone) No extra software is required to use this, but you can install the ""app"" or go online to the TKSTAR website and log into that to use the tracker online. You do have to enable GPRS on the tracker sim this is done via text message and you will need to set the APN number (this is different for every network but easy to find)A few other features this has: SOS button this can be set again by text so that pressing it notifies a user set phone number. It's possible to reset/format and control the sleeping action/time of the tracker via text. Bands supported are: 850/900/1800/1900Mhz. I used a 3G sim for testing without problems.I found it quite easy to set up no problems getting it to work just bear in mind a few things firstly the network signal if you are in a remote location no signal means no communication with the tracker networks will vary here it's not likely to be a problem for most users. GPS is accurate to around 5-6 metres, though indoors will vary outside there were no issues with it locking on consistently. The maker quotes a battery standby of 180 hours it's hard to test this without extensive use but the power saving settings can come into play here.I like the design it's small and rugged in build and easy to find a place in a bag/car or being carried on a keychain/pocket. The manual has most of the important information you need, but could use a translator to give it a going over the essential stuff is easily picked out though. App worked well without any stability problems. Quite a few applications for this a child, friend or relative going away or on a trip, if you want to just keep tabs on an object or car it's ideal for this purpose. I can see a few would be detectives going for this too, small enough to tuck away discreetly, though pets are another potential use. Over time I can see the technology developing with products like this but right now this is affordable and works well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3YUPZE5QTFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5HGH7A#wasThisHelpful","R1T3YUPZE5QTFI","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up one of these on a special deal an ex display model, with 12 months warranty. The X-E1 has been discontinued, but remains very attractively priced if you can find older stock or a second hand buy. This model sits between the entry X range and the X-Pro 1 and X-T1 and has been replaced with the X-E2. This bundle includes the XF 18-55 mm f/2.8-4 OIS lens this is quite a good optic and is a cut above the normal 18-55mm kit lenses being both better build and faster aperture wise it's a good all round lens.Warts aside the camera has had some significant firmware updates, and retains the same X-Trans CMOS sensor that the X-Pro 1 has, even though there are newer models the image quality is virtually identical between all the cameras (at least in raw)My summary of stronger and weaker aspects of the camera having shot with one for a few weeks nowGood points:+ Solid build, partial magnesium alloy it's not quite as beefy as the X-Pro 1 but a step up in build v the entry models+ Good high resolution EVF 2.3 million dot OLED+ Excellent sensor, good details and dynamic range lots of latitude for raw processing at both ends+ Very good jpeg processing (in fact much nicer than the newer models) contrast isn't too high, dynamic range is very decent and it doesn't suffer from the aggressive noise reduction new models do+ Great low light performance (though Fuji are overstating the actual ISO somewhat)+ Easy to use and mostly intuitive operation Q Menu is very useful and makes most settings within easy reach+ Some useful features like panoramic sweep, electronic level, option to store up to 7 custom settings+ AF + MF allows you to manual focus after autofocus (with latest firmware update)+ Focus peak feature useful for manual focus or using non Fuji lenses with an adapter, 2 levels of magnification+ Metering and Auto White Balance are mostly on target, appealing tonality and “look” to images (very subjective but many do like the Fuji look)+ Traditional “range finder” feel in both handling and style, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation give a more “hands on” experience, two buttons can be user set to specific functionsWeaker aspects:- EVF lags in lower light conditions (quite a bit)- Rear LCD is a perfectly usable 460k 2.8” panel but it's not up to the newer displays nothing stand out here- No way to remove the EV compensation on the EVF display (cuts into the image on the left hand side)- Continuous autofocus isn't great, central AF point only not really suitable for action or moving subjects (at least not moving quickly)- 2.5mm microphone socket the whole world uses 3.5mm and Fuji picks a non standard size (you can buy an adapter for it)- No shutter speed setting on the dial for the 1/180 sec flash sync speed. No “auto” setting for min. shutter speed (you just set it, not focal length aware useful but not as good as it might be) EVF doesn't show actual exposure until half pressing the shutter button (can be an issue in low light)- Cannot change battery or card when on a tripod (door is covered)Notes:Buffer depth is approx 12 frames at 6fps for raw (with a fast card)Battery life is quote at 350 frames, it's near to that actual world shooting (get a spare though)Video mode has no direct access though you can set it to one of the Fn buttons, you have a few options (not many) you can use an external mic and video is 1080p or 720p at 24fps (and only that)Video quality is passable but shows some signs of false colours and not really for serious use.There are no scene modes you can access shutter priority via the top dial (and use the D pad to select speeds in between those marked) Aperture priority is on the lens or if you have a lens without the ring on the rear dial. The closest to Auto is A setting on the shutter dial and A on the lens (i.e. a Program mode)The pop up flash works reasonably well though it's not hugely powerful, you have a hot shoe for external flash, a mini USB connector and HDMI out are under a door on the left hand side.**Firmware updates**Over time Fuji have done some significant updates for this model the latest firmware is:Ver.2.40Updates have included improvements to AF speed and accuracy (it is now on a par with the X-M1 X-A1 models) Min shutter speed can be set to 1/500 second, focus peak function was added, Fn 2 button added (to the bottom D pad button) option to MF after AF is confirmed (menu setting) and more.There are some important differences for users who are using non Fuji lenses with adapters, the viewfinder alone helps stability and hand holding significantly, the min shutter speed is 1/500 second (this is capped to 1/200 second on the entry models) this is a better choice than the X-M1 or X-A1 esp for longer focal lengths. For other users this is in most ways very much a “back to the old ways” type of camera, no face detection only a handful of features (panoramic and double exposure) and a complete lack of “scene modes” you are back to a shutter speed dial and aperture ring (if the lens has it) putting the emphasis on simplicity and not on snazzy features. For new users they might feel more at home with the entry level X models to start with, but more experienced shooters will probably enjoy the simplicity of the camera.Whilst the weaker points are worth looking at, esp the lag of the viewfinder in low light (the X-E2 resolved this), the camera still has a lot going for it, image quality is excellent even the jpegs strike a good balance between details and noise reduction (much better than the newer models here for some reason). Dynamic range is very good though do experiment with the DR settings 200% and 400% which improve the highlight details more. Newer models have ironed out the kinks and niggles of this camera and it doesn't sport the improved AF or some of the more advanced features/big EVF of the X-T1, but you can pick one of these up for a song and even if you don't have a lot of Fuji lenses DSLR users can pick up an adapter and use their own lenses (you'll have to focus and change aperture manually but in some ways that adds to the retro charm)I have one of these in addition to my SLR equipment, it makes a useful side kick and a capable camera in it's own right, but it's not for action shooters (the AF isn't up to the job) but for other tasks like landscape and portrait/street work, it's still a capable model. Something of a flawed gem but still worth hunting out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRGJ69MRR2XQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9HUAKY#wasThisHelpful","RLRGJ69MRR2XQ","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note: The maker sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewLED lights are all the rage of late and this headlamp offers not one but 4 LED's allowing you to pick a type of light that suits your need. The main unit is powered via 3 x AAA batteries (you get energizers in the box, but rechargeable ones make sense for longer term use) Main modes are selected via a single rubber button on the top section these are:- Main double power light (rated to 90 lumens max) with a range of 40 metres- ""Twin"" single power LED lights these are on the sides (16 lumens and a range of 25 metres)- A single ""red"" LED lamp which doesn't have a power rating and can't be dimmed but it's enough to see your way in total darkness (or to use as an SOS light)Both of the main lighting modes have adjustable power output this is achieved by holding down the button once the light is on it moves up and down in power slowly until you release the button. In addition the twin and red LED's can be set to ""blinking mode"" where they flash repeatedly.I've no way of accurately measuring the output, but the main double power light is strong more than enough to light up areas quite a distance in front of you, this main light is also warmer v the cooler light of the twin LED's this makes it quite easy to work out which lights are active. The twin and double power lights have a good side spread with a concentration in the middle more obvious with the single light. To activate the red LED you hold the power down for about 3 seconds and it comes on. It doesn't take long to work out how to control the unit it's quite straight forward and it's not a bad idea to have just one button ton control all the modes.Onto the main light this has a hardened outer shell with the lenses in front of each LED to control the light it's dense and feels thick and unlikely to have any issues durability wise. The back section can be angled via ""clicks"" there are four positions from straight ahead to a downwards angle. For normal walking along you might want to set it slightly down.The strap is elasticated and fully adjustable comfort is good, though make sure you don't make it too tight if you are wearing it directly on your head the headband is wide and won't come off that easily. Power via the 3 x AAA batteries will vary the maker quotes at full blast the double power light can hit 43 hours of use, and 150 hours at the lowest setting, Twin LED's have 90 hours and a whopping 250 hours at the min power. One strange area was whilst the unit is IPX4 rated (resistant to splashes of water) it doesn't have a rubber seal on the battery compartment, still if they are happy to offer a lifetime warranty then that puts longevity at ease somewhat. I did use the light in a modest shower and didn't have any water invasion issues, but I will update the review if any concerns come to light.Quality overall feels very good in all areas nothing cheap about this it feels solid and strong which is important for any light which could get dropped at some point. As far as the light quality it's excellent and the ability to dim the main two lights is extremely useful at full pelt the main light is likely stronger than you would need and this way you can ""tune"" the light to the power you want. The red LED is said to help night vision I've not tested this extensively (it's based on the rods/cones of the eye and the rods being active in darkness and they are not sensitive to red light but provide some sight albeit without colour or details but exposure to normal light will ruin night vision, red won't) Either way it's nice to have it as an extra, though most folks will use the two main lights.Uses for this are quite extensive really plenty of times I've needed to use my hands and not hold a torch fixing the car or working outside, fishing, cycling, camping, hiking, or just walking the dog you don't have to be a rock climber or cave explorer to find a use for this (though I'm sure it works a treat for those activities) I do have torches but this is much more useful to have. Overall a top tier headlamp is almost every way it's a flexible lighting product that is well made and designed.

"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewNo shortage of USB charging options on the market but this one seems to strike a good balance price/quality, a nice extra is the ""intelligent"" output of the 3 ports. No need to worry about which port to plug in to (usually rated at 1 or 2 amps on most chargers) this one is smart enough to provide optimal charging for whatever you are using be it Apple or Android phones/tablets as well as the advantage of running an in car GPS or Dash camera off the ports if you want. This can fast charge all 3 ports too at up to 2.4 amps per port not something you see on many 3 port chargers.The main charging unit is plastic but it feels quite dense and covered with a nice ""soft touch"" rubber finish it adds a bit of class to the product. 3 ports sit on the top section with an LED power light below that. Metal areas are gold coloured and with a smart blue trim it's an attractive item but the icing on the cake is yet to come.Included is a ""coiled cable"" not any old cable I would add, a normal micro USB cable which plugs into the charging port this is not. Coiled up it's about 70cm long, but extends to over 2 metres with ease allowing you to connect up devices for back seat passengers with no problems at all. The cable deserves a special mention not just for the ""coiled"" part but the build on the cable is something else. It feels ultra robust and has quality grips on both ends, the cable girth is significantly higher than most cables I've seen (the maker states it is optimised for charging and won't work for data transfer) it looks and feels super strong and likely to withstand some serious abuse.At this price point this is easily one of the best I've used overall in terms of the package on offer (the ultra tough longer USB cable alone is worth the asking price almost) No problems to report this charger is well made, very competitively priced and oozes quality, the fact it also has a high output on all ports and they are all intelligent ports makes it an outstanding buy in my books.

"This SD card from Transcend is rated at class 4 speeds, which is adequate for some devices speed wise. But with newer cameras and higher resolution video becoming the norm the performance is starting to lag a little.Build is fine standard plastics on the case I've had this card for a few years and it's fine for use in an older compact. I tested the speed at:Read: 11 MB/sWrite: 5.7 MB/sThat's a little above the required class 4 rating, but a normal class 10 card will give around double the write speed and most class 10 cards I've tested will get near to 20 MB's pulling files off the card (ie read speed). If you're transferring larger files the read time on slower cards like this can come into play. It's not a bad card not had any problems using it, but only really recommended for non video/photo use or older cameras with smaller files. You can save a bit with the lower speed if you want a big capacity, the small price premium you pay for a class 10 card has effectively made class 4 cards redundant for most users. Not bad, but starting to look a little dated in 2015 speed wise","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HU7V6GXC06Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QJV3T4#wasThisHelpful","R3HU7V6GXC06Z2","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker provided me with a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThe M04 headphones come nicely boxed with clear and simple instructions very easy to follow. Build wise the headphones are a cut above what you might expect at this price point, good quality plastics, metal rails in the adjusters on either side and some excellent very soft padding on the headband and ear cups. It takes about 2.5 hours to charge these up (LED lights red whilst charging and goes out when finished) I got over 15 hours of playback at fairly high levels, endurance is good for a set of Bluetooth headphones lower volumes will yield longer play time.Controls are straight forward to pair up the phones press and hold the power button (this also doubles as a call answer/end control) on the left hand side the LED's flash red/blue pair up the ""M04"" and it's ready to go I tested the range and got about 8 metres this will vary depending on the transmission device (ie tablet/phone) and if you try to punch through concrete walls the range will be less but certainly above average performance here.On the left hand side you have separate volume control buttons, next to the power button at the front is a ""mesh grill"" the microphone sits behind this, this performs well being quite clear picking up sound (though it can pick up background noises a bit) it does however have the advantage of being integrated into the casing and near to where your mouth is. Right hand side has 3 buttons track forward/back and play/pause very easy to get used to this wearing the phones the track and volume buttons have raised dots so you can by feel know what you are changing.**Audio Quality**Very good, the phones would be best described as ""smooth"" in terms of sound, bass is well reproduced not overly thumpy either nor too laid back, mid tones and treble as balanced not overly harsh but clear and defined. I tried quite a few different styles of music from instrumental to metal and pop a very satisfactory listening experience in all cases. If you like edgy and hard this might not suit your listening style, for me though they occupy a middle ground where you can adjust the EQ to suit your taste in output.Stereo separation was also very good well above average here for the price pointBeing ""closed type"" phones sound isolation is good with not much sound leakage, this won't annoy people at moderate volume levels if you're in a quiet place**Areas for improvement**My experience mirrors that of another review here in that there are a few minor points to note with the headphones. I would agree that the ""mini"" USB cover (cable is included for charging) is difficult to open, it's a harder plastic covering and quite stiff even with a fingernail it can be tricky to remove, one solution might be a rubber material or I found leaving the cover just slightly raised helped no end. If you push it back fully it's not so easy to open up.The other niggle is the powering on it's easy to go into pairing mode by accident if you are wearing the phones you'll notice the ascending tones when it's powered on, if you hold it for another few seconds it will try to pair up. A longer delay between powering up and pairing (or moving the pairing button to play/pause) would solve this.I wouldn't mind the choice of having a 3.5mm cable to plug in (to use with non Bluetooth devices) but that's a very small suggestion**Conclusion*A special mention must go to the comfort and design of the phones, to date one of the most comfy pair of phones I've used thanks in part to a generous soft padding on the ear cups and the headband. Weight is very light too really you won't even notice you have them on, top marks in this area.I'm slightly torn on rating with these the minor points noted could be addressed, but the supreme comfort and warm smooth sound output genuinely are impressive and really the phones punch well above their price point in these areas. On balance Ausdom have a winner here well made, good sound easy to recommend as very good affordable over the ears headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTJ259DL949X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NM4LKJG#wasThisHelpful","RJTJ259DL949X","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewModel: BTSP-10POpening up the box this speaker is quite a nice small size 17cm length by 5 cm wide and stands about 6.5cm tall. In the box you get a felt pouch to store the speaker, a micro USB cable for charging, and a flat style 3.5mm male to male lead (gold plated) Build is solid with a ""soft touch"" effect on the case, a nice contrasting red speaker grill area. Controls are dead simple the top section has the Bluetooth logo (press and hold it for about 5-6 seconds to enter pairing mode - the LED glows red/blue on the front and you get a 2 tone audio beep this turns to blue when it's paired), this button is also your play/pause control. The +/- buttons as expected control the volume output. On the right side is the power switch, micro USB port for charging and the 3.5mm auxiliary input this switches over automatically if you plug the lead in. The underside has 4 soft rubber pads to help it grip and absorb vibrations.**In use**Charging from flat takes just over 3 hours the manual cautions about using a faster than 1.0 amp charging output (many chargers will regulate their power output but to be on the safe side pick the 1 amp ports) Battery life was very good I got over 9 hours at fairly high volumes with some power still left, at more modest volume levels you should be able to extend that a bit and even more if you use the Aux input as the Bluetooth won't be in use.The call functions of the speaker are controlled by the Bluetooth button a single press answers and ends calls a double press redials the last number. Built in microphone did a good job of picking up my voice clear and easy for others to hear me. Bluetooth range I tested it at around 8 metres this might vary depending on the device you transmit from and if it's a clear line of sight (walls will reduce it a bit) no complaints here a clean signal and no dropping out either.**Sound quality**This speaker has 2 x 3 watt output power quite good for the dimensions of the unit. Sound output was well balanced with some good bass reproduction, and clean mid tones and treble, the maker has done a good job of ensuring no one area swamps out the others vocals a crisp and the bass is strong enough without being over bearing on the other frequencies. In terms of volume it's quite a loud speaker (more than you might imagine for the size) but the important part is the quality of the sound rather than just the volume and this speaker delivers a very good sound that will suit a variety of difference music tastes. As will all speakers of this type you can adjust the EQ on the connected device though it didn't really need a lot of tweaking. Sound was good though the Aux input though you might need to adjust the volume on the device playing don't ramp it up too high.**Areas for improvement**Not many areas to nit pick the speaker has good build and sound output, and it's nice to have the small bag to keep the speaker protected and the cables with it. I wouldn't mind a micro sd card slot it's not essential but it can be handy to have one (the cards are cheap and you can pre-load a lot of music onto the card)**Final thoughts**For this size of speaker it's nice to see some attention paid to the larger capacity battery and the sound quality. It's small enough to carry with you or take out for a day trip, but has a sound that is full enough to satisfy most users. A very nice speaker and a quality product in this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KXOBTQZPMJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFDT07Q#wasThisHelpful","R18KXOBTQZPMJP","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This card reader offers support for all the main card formats out there, including some older ones that don't get used much (XD) Support extends to SD cards up to XC, Compact flash type I and II, micro SD, all the memory stick formats (duo and pro) and the M2 one too. Pretty much all bases are covered here.I tested cards of 64GB with no issues larger cards should work as well.The unit is quite well made, solid feeling plastics on the white areas, a blue LED glows when a card is inserted and flashes when transferring data. The reader can push down into the misted semi transparent plastic protector, pushing in the sides released it upwards to allow cards to be fitted. This is useful if you are travelling with the card reader as it prevents damage to the contacts or debris/dirt getting inside. On the bottom part you have a rubber pad in a cut out square shape to help hold the reader firmly on a surface. CF slot is well recessed this should help to avoid any bent pins.The supplied cable is approx. 110 cm in length and uses a micro USB 3.0 socket on the rear of the card reader.Being a USB 3.0 card reader speeds are quick across all the card formats (subject to a USB 3.0 port of course), USB 2.0 can also be used.Performance wise I compared it to my Kingston USB 3.0 card reader and there was nothing in it much, a few MB/s either way for both readers so I would call it a draw on that side. There are a few areas though where I feel the card reader falls down a little, firstly inserting SD cards they tend to stick a little more than the Kingston not enough to worry me but not as smooth as that unit. The second point is the ""press in tabs"" on either side to release the reader on my sample one tends to get stuck ""in"" this doesn't stop you using the reader or opening/closing it but for a more expensive reader I'd look for flawless mechanics. It might just be my sample but it's worth a mention.In terms of the Lexar V the Kingston both are fast and both are solid feeling card readers (the Lexar is a bit larger and heavier) The Lexar does have the advantage of supporting XD cards, this isn't on the Kingston USB 3.0 reader (all the other formats are) if I had to pick one I think the Kingston is the better reader overall just by a hair on the smoother card insertion. I use the Lexar with a laptop and I think it's the better card reader for travelling thanks to the push down design. But for desktop use the Kingston USB 3.0 reader is better value for money. Either will likely please users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOTBREC798EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VQ2YUY#wasThisHelpful","R1TOTBREC798EV","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis hard drive enclosure is made entirely from plastic, though it feels quite good in density and fairly solid to the touch. Installation is quick and easy slide off the top cover, insert the HDD or SSD put on the cover again and it's ready to use. There are no drivers to install it's plug and play, to get the best speeds though you should ensure you use a USB 3.0 connections but it works perfectly well with USB 2.0.In the box is a small sticky foam pad this can be used to prevent a thinner hard drive from moving around this unit can take up to 9.5mm drives most of the bigger 2.5"" drives (ie over 500GB) are this size. The USB cable connects via a standard micro USB 3.0 connection, this is quite thick and feels of good quality.Performance will largely be based on the host USB controller, but this was just as quick as recent similar enclosures I've reviewed so nothing to complain about speed wise here. The fastest SSD's will exceed the USB 3.0 bandwidth but at that level you can move huge files around and very quickly it's really not something likely to bother most users it's much quicker than the older USB 2.0. On the front is a blue LED that glows when powered and data is being transferred, there is a DC 5 volt socket too. A nice touch is the auto power save function this spins the drive down to idle if it's not used for half an hour.No obvious complaints here this does the job well and is certainly up to par on speed. I wouldn't mind a few rubber pads on the bottom of the case if you have it on a desk to stop it moving around, vibrations are rarely an issue on 2.5"" hard drives and obvious not a concern at all on SSD's. This unit is probably better suited if you are likely to change the drive more frequently, the other model (FE205) has an aluminium top and a different method of insertion. This one is faster to change drives, the other one does feel a bit more solid in the hand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY58QSJ0REQGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFJ1UK6#wasThisHelpful","RY58QSJ0REQGY","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the ""uprated"" version of Sony's higher speed weather resistant SD cards, the first model was quite quick for read times (over 90MB/s) but somewhat below the comparable SanDisk extreme cards for write performance.Both cards look very similar, but take note of the ""3"" in the U box which is the newer faster speed rating (rather than the ""1"" number) I reviewed the original card and it was about 39-40MB/s this newer version tested quite a lot faster for the write times:Read: 87MB/sWrite: 60 MB/sThere was some variation in speeds for read times (it got over 90MB/s in some tests) this is the average figure I came to. Write times were consistently on the specification of 60MB/s making this card on a par with the SanDisk Extreme PLUS, in fact a bit faster on read speeds (that card is rated 80MB/s read 60MB/s write) and it's slightly cheaper too.You don't get a case with the card it's in a ""eco pack"" The case material is strengthened over a normal SD card and resists shock, temperature, water and X-rays just like it's competitor. In camera performance was also excellent and buffer clearing times are a good bit improved over the first Sony model. One minor area where Sony could improve the warranty is 5 years, whilst I doubt many people return cards years after purchase some makers are offering lifetime warranties.To get the full benefit from this card you need a camera that is UHS (ultra high speed) compatible, though it will work with any device that can support the larger card size. The ""U3"" designation requires that a card meet a minimum of 30MB/s speed read/write this far exceeds that and is also rated for use with ""4K"" video capture. If you've been using the U1 Sony cards and felt the write performance wasn't as good as it might be, then this gives you a 50% boost in write speeds and it's quite noticeable especially if you do a lot of action and hit the camera buffer frequently. Sony do have a 90MB/s (write) card out there which I have yet to test, but the speed of this is likely fast enough for many without attracting the price premium some of the fastest SD cards do. A solid card it's fast, well made and an attractive price.

"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal view**Model no. YH-700C**This is the second model I have tested from Avantek, branded as “Aperlite YH-700C”, this is very similar in appearance to the DF 660 externally but there some important differences in this model.The flash is very well specified; in feature set it is comparable to the Canon 580 EXII that means not only is it a fully dedicated TTL flash, but it's capable of acting as a “master” and “slave” flash and it offers HSS (high speed sync). In effect you're getting a “fully featured flash” for off and on camera work that is complete in functionality and lacking almost nothing (bar weather sealing) Included in the bundle are soft bag for storing the flash, a flash stand and instructionsI tested the unit side by side with a 580 EXII flashgun and rounded up a list of stronger and weaker points.Good points:+ Decent build overall, plastics are quite dense and the unit feels well put together, metal shoe+ Supports advanced features such as TTL Master/Slave flash (with ratio control), HSS (high speed sync) and a modelling light, flash exposure bracketing+ Fast re-cycle times around 3 seconds at full power+ Strong power output and consistent exposures in TTL off and on camera+ Optical slave mode with or without pre-flash suppression+ Full manual control from 1/1 to 1/128 power in 1/3 of a stop increments for a fine degree of control+ Auto zoom head with manual control of the zoom possible, has audible “beeps”+ Relatively simple operation, which will be familiar to anyone who has used a Canon OEM flash+ Built in “wide angle panel” (14mm) and white bounce card+ PC sync socket and port for power pack+ Remarkable feature set for the price+ Excellent bright AF assist beam (spraying a pattern of lines to allow focus in low light)Weaker areas:- Viewing angles on the LCD are not great top/bottom (but fine from side to side)- I would prefer a better quality “flash pouch” where you can store the flash and the stand- Some buttons have “dual functions” not marked on the flashgun, would be better if the back-light button could activate for longer, or if there was a mode to turn it on so any button would activate the back light- Custom settings show just a number (you'll need to look at the manual to see what settings they change or check the camera in the external flash settings menu)- Pilot button doesn't light when ready (but you have audible beeps and a confirmation in the viewfinder)Notes:I fired 35 full power shots in quick succession, there was no sign of the flash shutting down or over heating (there is a safety cut off feature) it's unlikely to be an issue in day to day use of this flash (test cells 4 x Eneloop AA's)Key differences between the 580 EXII flash and the YH-700CThe 580 EXII is weather sealed the YH-700C is notThere is an “E” mode on the Canon flash this meters off the flash sensor (not the camera, aka Auto mode, like the Metz “A” mode) the 700C does not have thisThe 700C uses a four way pad v the dial on the Canon flashgunSlightly fewer custom settings on the 700CThe 580 EXII flash does not have an audible beep function, the YH-700C does (but no pilot light)The YH-700C has a traditional “screw down” lock the 580 II has a quick lock mechanism**In use**I used the flash in combination with a 580 EXII flash on and off camera switching between the two models and taking turns as a master/slave unit. I had no problems with the 700C flash in fact the exposures were almost identical to the Canon flash and hard to tell apart only minor variations using a tripod mounted camera. Power output is very slightly less than the Canon but I would say not even 1/3 of a stop in difference. No issues to report with reliability either (will update the review if required)Operation is near on identical between the two flashes (though this flash has a 4 way pad v the dial on the Canon flash) the main buttons are:Mode: This bigger button cycles between the 3 main modes E-TTL, Manual and Multi (strobe flash)Light button: Turns the back-light on, with a longer press enters the custom settings modeArrows: This cycles the HSS mode on/off and activates second curtain syncMusic button: This controls the audio signal on/offZoom button: Manually change the zoom of the head, a long press enters the “wireless flash modes” (where you can use E-TTL off camera wireless as a master/slave or the optical off camera mode)Central button: Pressing this lets you set the flash exposure compensation or the flash bracketing mode. Used in combination with the 4 way controller you can adjust settings in other modes.Pilot: This fires a test flash to reflect the settings (ie strobe or manual etc)If you've used a Canon flash like the 580 EXII then this will be very easy to get used to it's the same display and very similar button layout, though some might not find it as immediately intuitive as some other flashes it doesn't take long to get the hang of it though. The main drawback of using the Canon system is the lack of identification on the custom menus (just a number) the Avantek flash has a few less than the Canon.**Final thoughts**It's possible to find a few areas where the flashgun could be improved the addition of lettering for the “dual functions” most notable the wireless flash settings require a long press of the zoom button to access them. More recent flashes from Canon have moved the interface forward a bit (and offer built in radio flash) with quicker and easier controls, the 580 EXII was for a long time the “work horse” high level flash for Canon users, with a full feature set, good build and lots of power output. This flash takes 98% of that and puts it into a flash body that costs a fraction of what a higher end OEM maker flash goes for. Importantly the addition of Master flash control via this unit means you can control other dedicated flashes off camera, and it's even more useful if you have a body that doesn't have a built in flash.For a long time to get a “high spec” does it all flash you'd have to outlay pretty hefty sum to get there. Whilst this isn't a perfect flash, some third party flash makers have been working hard to move past simple manual flashes, incorporating high end features into much more affordable flash units. This latest flash raises the bar even higher and the gauntlet has been thrown firmly down onto the ground no longer do users have to pay very high prices for a flash to get the “Full Monty” of features. This is a warning shot to all the main camera makers and from a customer viewpoint this is fantastic news you can buy 3 or 4 of these flashes making a very cost effective off camera set up (but fully usable on camera with no limitations) for far less than one high end OEM unit. A quality flash, it does almost everything you could want and at a price that makes any minor niggles fade away. I only hope this model is ported across to other makes.

"Note: The marker provided me with a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis pack of ""four"" micro USB cables includes 2 x 1 metre cables and 2 x 2 metre ones. A lot of products come with cables shorter than 1 metre, very few come with ones as long as 2 metres. So you have handy selection here if you need some replacement cables or extra ones.Instead of the usual PVC cable casing these have a good quality ""braided"" cable which seems to hold up better in use longer term (it doesn't split easily and is firmer). The interesting aspect of these cables are that they have a different design to a normal USB plug usually you have the plastic section at the bottom with the contacts on top of this (thus can be inserted only one way) here the maker has decided to use a central part with contacts on ""both sides"" (see attached photo)This works well as you can insert the plug in both directions and it's fully functional for charging and data transfer. Do bear in mind that these are ""USB 2"" cables (as a normal micro USB cable is USB 2.0) that means around 30MB/s speeds. No problems to report charging or using the cables for moving around data. A simple product but some extra thought has gone into these, and the cabling quality is a cut above many offerings.

"Note: The maker sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewModel: Neewer NW985 NThis flash unit comes boxed with a clip on diffuser, a padded bag (with a section to store the flash stand) a flash stand with a brass thread and instructions. Third party flash makers have in recent times been ""upping their game"" offering more and more features on flash units that cost far less than OEM makers.This model has a significant important addition over some budget flashes, the ability to do HSS (Auto-FP) older third party models were usually limited to manual or basic TTL, Auto-FP can be very useful as it allows you to use fill flash at all shutter speeds (even above the cameras official sync speed) it does this by very fast strobe bursts, whilst range is limited (power is reduced in this mode) it means you can use fill flash outside in bright light with faster lenses, and it can be useful for some flash tasks (which require a fast shutter speed)I've been testing the unit quite extensively and have rounded up a list of the stronger and weaker points of the flash unit.Good points:+ Solid build quality, tight joins on the flash body and metal shoe+ Operation is intuitive and straight forward very easy to grasp+ Large and bright LCD panel with colour coded display for flash functions good viewing angles+ Supports a wide range of features including I-TTL dedicated flash, TTL wireless flash (CLS), optical slave flash (with or without pre-flash suppression), ""multi"" strobe, flash bracketing and full manual flash control (in 1/3 stop increments for fine tuning) and Auto FP+ Good bundle includes a well made padded case, diffuser and flash stand+ Mostly consistent exposure v a dedicated Nikon flash (slight tendency to be about 0.5 EV half a stop under at times) easy to adjust output and not a huge problem+ Built in WA panel and white card+ High speed flash shooting is available at 1/16 output @12fps, supports rear curtain sync+ AF assist beam is quite effective (a sprayed out pattern of dots outside the central area)+ Audio signals (can also be turned off)+ Port to add external power pack+ Has a pc sync portWeaker points:- GN (power output) a bit lower than the headline figure I tested the output v a Metz 58 AF-2 (which is accurate) and calculated the actual GN to be about GN 48-50 (a bit less) still quite powerful just not as strong as some higher end units- Flash shuts down when it overheats (would be better to slow down the re-cycle times) see flash heat test below- Supplied diffuser a little fiddly to fitNotes:Manual power output is 1/128- 1/1 in 1/3 stop incrementsZoom can be set to ""auto"" (will zoom the head when you change the lens focal length or zoom) or manual from 18-180mmRe-cycle times at full power were about 3 seconds**Flash overheating test**I fired off 25 shots at full power (normal room temperature) and the flash started to emit a rapid beep, this was the overheat protection kicking in, it took about 3 minutes before the flash could be used again. Once the flash was operational I fired off another 17 shots and it took a fairly lengthy 8 minutes before it would let me fire the flash. You can change settings but you won't be able to use the flash until it's cooled down. In normal day to day use it's not that likely you will be firing the flash at full blast in rapid succession, so you might not encounter the overheating (to be fair even some expensive flashes will shut down) it is preferable though to slow down the re-cycle times rather than shut down.**What it doesn't have**Whilst the flash is well featured for it's price, there are a few points to note where some of the high end OEM makers units offer a bit more, firstly there is no ""modelling light"" this fires a burst of shots so you can see where the shadows are, you can mimic this mode by using the ""Multi mode""The flash isn't weather sealed nor would I expect it to beIt can't act as a ""Master"" flash that is control other flashes via TTL, again at this price point it's not something I'd look for, but you can set the output manually and another optical slave flash controlling it that way**In use**Operation is simple the mode button cycles though the i-TTL mode, Manual, Multi (strobe) and Wireless. To enter the custom functions simply push and hold the central button (surrounded by the 4 buttons) and you can adjust settings like bracketing order, audio signals, AF light (Auto FP can be activated here) Using the 4 way controller/buttons you can cycle though the settings. A pilot light test fires the flash and lights when it's ready to fire. Holding down the on/off button controls the power.The supplied manual was easy enough to follow though the translations were quite poor in places fortunately the flash is intuitive to use and it won't take long to get the hang of itFlash head does not have a locking mechanism but is quite stiff moving it around at various angles very unlikely it will be knocked out of place easily**Wireless flash**There are 3 settings here i-TTL dedicated slave off camera flash this is a metered exposure and you can use multiple flashes in combination, you have 3 groups and four channels it's possible to set the zoom manually from 18-180mm.The other modes are ""optical"" off camera flash operation S1 fires the flash instantly when it sees a flash, S2 is ""pre flash"" delay if you are using the on-board or a TTL flash then this will have a pre-flash. This mode also allows you to use the flash with any other camera (even compacts)^^^Notes for Nikon users: NW985 N^^^The entry level bodies in the Nikon range do NOT support Auto FP, this is because the bodies won't allow it (a Nikon design choice not a flash issue) this includes models like the D3100, D3200, D3300, and D5100, D5200, D5300. Models above this do work with Auto FP such as the D80/D90, D7000/71000, D200, D300/s, D600/700/800 in short the mid level ""enthusiast bodies"" and all the semi/pro level bodies will work with Auto FP. As a workaround pick up an ND filter this reduces the light to the camera and will allow you to use fill flash with faster lensesThe lower end bodies also don't support i-TTL ""wireless flash"" control with the built in flash (again it's been left out) that means D3000-D3300 bodies and D5000-D5300 all Nikon bodies above this do allow the built in flash to act as a commander. You can still use the built in flash to trigger the flash optically (or pick up radio triggers) and you can fire the built in flash with manual power (no pre-flash)It's still a viable alternative to the SB700 in most ways bar the ability to act as a Master/Commander flash.**Final thoughts**There are some niggles and points to note with this flash, but really considering the very low cost and overall strong feature set most of the compromises are unlikely to be a major problem.Both the build and bundle are impressive for such a low price, the flash performs well in use both on the hot shoe and in wireless mode with a good range on the optical sensor too. The addition of Auto FP sets this flash apart from other models, this usually is reserved for mid level OEM makers and you'd normally Neewer would have a top tier flashgun at a cracking price, as it is they've managed to get most of it right and this flash is very capable and does most of what a higher be looking to spend quite bit more; to see it on a flash at this price point would have been unthinkable a few years ago.With a few tweaks and improvements it would be near perfect, as it is though it's still a strong offering and a capable affordable flash","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEMTOU5ZVB6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC9E4XM#wasThisHelpful","R3PEMTOU5ZVB6U","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up one of these on a special deal an ex display model, with 12 months warranty. The X-E1 has been discontinued, but remains very attractively priced if you can find older stock or a second hand buy. This model sits between the entry X range and the X-Pro 1 and X-T1 and has been replaced with the X-E2.Warts aside the camera has had some significant firmware updates, and retains the same X-Trans CMOS sensor that the X-Pro 1 has, even though there are newer models the image quality is virtually identical between all the cameras (at least in raw)My summary of stronger and weaker aspects of the camera having shot with one for a few weeks nowGood points:+ Solid build, partial magnesium alloy it's not quite as beefy as the X-Pro 1 but a step up in build v the entry models+ Good high resolution EVF 2.3 million dot OLED+ Excellent sensor, good details and dynamic range lots of latitude for raw processing at both ends+ Very good jpeg processing (in fact much nicer than the newer models) contrast isn't too high, dynamic range is very decent and it doesn't suffer from the aggressive noise reduction new models do+ Great low light performance (though Fuji are overstating the actual ISO somewhat)+ Easy to use and mostly intuitive operation Q Menu is very useful and makes most settings within easy reach+ Some useful features like panoramic sweep, electronic level, option to store up to 7 custom settings+ AF + MF allows you to manual focus after autofocus (with latest firmware update)+ Focus peak feature useful for manual focus or using non Fuji lenses with an adapter, 2 levels of magnification+ Metering and Auto White Balance are mostly on target, appealing tonality and “look” to images (very subjective but many do like the Fuji look)+ Traditional “range finder” feel in both handling and style, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation give a more “hands on” experience, two buttons can be user set to specific functionsWeaker aspects:- EVF lags in lower light conditions (quite a bit)- Rear LCD is a perfectly usable 460k 2.8” panel but it's not up to the newer displays nothing stand out here- No way to remove the EV compensation on the EVF display (cuts into the image on the left hand side)- Continuous autofocus isn't great, central AF point only not really suitable for action or moving subjects (at least not moving quickly)- 2.5mm microphone socket the whole world uses 3.5mm and Fuji picks a non standard size (you can buy an adapter for it)- No shutter speed setting on the dial for the 1/180 sec flash sync speed. No “auto” setting for min. shutter speed (you just set it, not focal length aware useful but not as good as it might be) EVF doesn't show actual exposure until half pressing the shutter button (can be an issue in low light)- Cannot change battery or card when on a tripod (door is covered)Notes:Buffer depth is approx 12 frames at 6fps for raw (with a fast card)Battery life is quote at 350 frames, it's near to that actual world shooting (get a spare though)Video mode has no direct access though you can set it to one of the Fn buttons, you have a few options (not many) you can use an external mic and video is 1080p or 720p at 24fps (and only that)Video quality is passable but shows some signs of false colours and not really for serious use.There are no scene modes you can access shutter priority via the top dial (and use the D pad to select speeds in between those marked) Aperture priority is on the lens or if you have a lens without the ring on the rear dial. The closest to Auto is A setting on the shutter dial and A on the lens (i.e. a Program mode)The pop up flash works reasonably well though it's not hugely powerful, you have a hot shoe for external flash, a mini USB connector and HDMI out are under a door on the left hand side.**Firmware updates**Over time Fuji have done some significant updates for this model the latest firmware is:Ver.2.40Updates have included improvements to AF speed and accuracy (it is now on a par with the X-M1 X-A1 models) Min shutter speed can be set to 1/500 second, focus peak function was added, Fn 2 button added (to the bottom D pad button) option to MF after AF is confirmed (menu setting) and more.There are some important differences for users who are using non Fuji lenses with adapters, the viewfinder alone helps stability and hand holding significantly, the min shutter speed is 1/500 second (this is capped to 1/200 second on the entry models) this is a better choice than the X-M1 or X-A1 esp for longer focal lengths. For other users this is in most ways very much a “back to the old ways” type of camera, no face detection only a handful of features (panoramic and double exposure) and a complete lack of “scene modes” you are back to a shutter speed dial and aperture ring (if the lens has it) putting the emphasis on simplicity and not on snazzy features. For new users they might feel more at home with the entry level X models to start with, but more experienced shooters will probably enjoy the simplicity of the camera.Whilst the weaker points are worth looking at, esp the lag of the viewfinder in low light (the X-E2 resolved this), the camera still has a lot going for it, image quality is excellent even the jpegs strike a good balance between details and noise reduction (much better than the newer models here for some reason). Dynamic range is very good though do experiment with the DR settings 200% and 400% which improve the highlight details more. Newer models have ironed out the kinks and niggles of this camera and it doesn't sport the improved AF or some of the more advanced features/big EVF of the X-T1, but you can pick one of these up for a song and even if you don't have a lot of Fuji lenses DSLR users can pick up an adapter and use their own lenses (you'll have to focus and change aperture manually but in some ways that adds to the retro charm)I have one of these in addition to my SLR equipment, it makes a useful side kick and a capable camera in it's own right, but it's not for action shooters (the AF isn't up to the job) but for other tasks like landscape and portrait/street work, it's still a capable model. Something of a flawed gem but still worth hunting out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXKTBC13O287/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092MD5V8#wasThisHelpful","R2EXKTBC13O287","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This hot shoe adaptor has a few uses, it's designed to fit the inverted hot shoe found on Minolta and Sony bodies. But do note that the new Multi Interface shoe has front contacts so whilst this will work with flashes that have the new hoe shoe it won't provide TTL. If you want to use TTL dedicated flashes with the newer multi interface shoe then you want the Sony ADP-AMA adaptor this offers full functionality for older flashes on the latest bodies (A77II, A99, A58 and newer E mount ILC bodies)The main advantages of this are:1: Allows you to use standard hot shoe flashes on i-ISO hot shoes (you won't get TTL though as all the contact layouts are different between makers and brands)2: Adds a PC sync port to your camera, only the semi pro level and up bodies have this but this adaptor will give provide one handy for lower end bodies3: If you're doing some video and want to shoe mount a standard ISO hot shoe microphone you can now do soBuild is good with decent plastics on the casing, the fit is firm on the cameras I tested it on. This has a button on the right hand side you press this in and pull it off to release it, it's an auto lock mechanism (locks as soon as it's fitted to the hot shoe)Whilst this does add a bit of height I didn't find any problems with durability with a flash mounted on top of the camera. It's worth having one of these around whilst you don't get TTL with other flashes you can use them in manual mode and the PC sync port is something worth having on it's own if you have bodies that lack this. It does the job well for it's intended purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FERTWEGMSVNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMAYKEW#wasThisHelpful","R3FERTWEGMSVNJ","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a bit of a fan of the first game I had to check this one out and pleased to say this offers some improvements over the original game. I will say though it is a steeper level of difficulty on the first instalment the game eased you in on the first couple of nights, but here it seems to have ramped things up a little so you'll need a bit of patience when playing this one.The story now has you playing Jeremy the security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, this time around though there are a few key differences, we now have a total of 10 animatronic characters and there are no doors to block them off. Instead you are equipped with a ""Freddy Fazbear mask"" and a torch to ward off the enemies the torch has limited power in the batteries. You also have a ""music box"" that needs to be wound up to keep playing if it stops you can be attacked by some of the animals and you can track their movements again with the CCTV cameras.Another difference is when you die/fail you get to play one of 4 ""retro looking games""Just like the first game you have 5 nights to get through, once you've done that you complete a sixth night and this one is very difficult to beat a real challenge for players. If you manage to beat that you open up the AI settings for characters and can play a variety of pre-set challenges.The only real downside is the balancing I think it gets fairly hard quite quickly so persist with this and you'll get through it. It is an evolution of the first game, and if you liked that you'll probably love this too. It can be a bit frustrating esp with the Freddy mask you can be so close sometimes and just a little late putting it on and it's all over. I've played this a lot with my son and we both enjoy if you want something simple but scary and fun this is well worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKSM78JKOIX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ6ZF1E#wasThisHelpful","RFKSM78JKOIX3","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The D3300 is a minor update to the D3200, it does offer most of what a new user might be looking for, or a decent choice for someone moving up from a bridge or compact camera, wanting to expand their photography knowledgeIt's also easy to use and learn on.There are a few limitations though compared to higher priced bodies, which I will go into later on. This won't matter to many users, but they are worth a mentionA quick summary of the notable strong and weaker points of the cameraPros:+ Excellent image quality from the 24mp sensor, good dynamic range too. Nikon removed the optical low pass filter this increases the resolution a bit, you can shoot RAW and JPEG+ 11-point AF system with central cross sensor is quite good enough at this price point+ Nicely made and a smaller more compact size for a DSLR, quite comfy in the hand+ Fairly well featured for an entry DSLR, has most of what you might want to start off with (bear in mind cons section)+ Has HD video 1920 x 1080 50p which is sharp and clean. You do have autofocus (contrast) with the AF-F mode+ 3.5mm mic input+ ""Guide mode"" can be useful for some people it can help with shooting situations, but it's not perfect+ Range of creative effect/filters to play with+ Metering and WB are improved over the previous model quite consistent in most situations+ Built in white light AF assist (helps the camera focus in lower light) it works, though it can be distracting for people shots inside+ Good battery life around 600 shots+ 5fps continuous shooting is quite fast for an entry level camera, buffer is quite small though (about 6 frames raw)Cons:- No exposure bracketing (about time at least something was added here), no depth of field preview- No Auto FP (High speed sync), this allows your external flash to sync at all shutter speeds with the camera, particularly useful for daylight fill in flash photography, where you will easily go over the normal 1/200 flash sync speed with faster lenses or on a bright day. Camera doesn't support it so you will have to use ND filters as a workaround (to reduce light to the camera)- No built in AF motor in the body. This is less of an issue now that most recent Nikon lenses have motors built into them, but if you are digging around for second hand (or non AF-S)lenses it's something to consider. You can still use screw driven lenses but manual focus only- Live view is fairly slow to focus, it's ok for non moving subjects though. Video AF-F can jump about a bit trying to focus- No support for wireless (CLS) flash with the built in flash. You can use radio triggers though or optical slave flashes (Yongnuo etc)Body controls wise, fairly straight forward. Menus are easy to use and navigate. There is a lack of some controls on the body, direct buttons for some important functions are not present such as ISO and WB settings. You can set the ""Fn"" button on the left hand side under the flash raise button can be set to (WB, ISO, image size and active D lighting) this helps quite a lot. As does using the ""info"" button which allows you to change settings on the rear LCD by moving around with the D pad.Nikon probably could do with re-vamping the controls a bit on their entry models, ie more direct controls. But it's ok for this segment.There is no vertical grip option from Nikon for the D3300. You can use the IR remote ML-L3 with the cameraCanon v Nikon:I won't get into this major debate, both makers have large and extensive systems, in terms of lenses and bodies.As a general guide Canon tend to be a bit more generous on entry bodies in terms of functionality (Auto FP, Wireless flash, DOF preview, bracketing) Nikon offer higher resolution sensors with better dynamic range, all their bodies have a built in AF assist light (none of Canon's do) If you are taking a photo course Canon might be a slightly better choice (those missing things might be useful for learning)Try both (and other makers too) and see what you like best. You can't beat a real hands on with cameras some bodies might just feel right, some might not. There are no real right or wrong choices, everyone is different. But it's worth thinking about what friends/family are using you can borrow and use lenses and other items. Look at the practical elements of your choice too.The removal of the optical low pass filter and slight increase in frames per second are the main improvements over the D3200, it is not a huge update over that model so if you have a D3200 you might want to look at the D5300 or even D7000/7100 to step up a bit to the next level.Second body shooters:The D3300 makes for a relatively inexpensive back up body, but the limitations on flash (esp Auto FP), less controls and no built in AF motor could be a factor. Look at what your needs are. This will do the job, but you might want to pick up something else if you need that.Image quality is very good, but 24mp is stretching things a bit on some cheaper lenses, it's worth looking at lens choices to get the most out of the camera. 24mp is overkill for most users, including many serious photographers..though landscape shooters won't complain. Don't just buy the camera just for 24mp, it won't make you a better photographer, it can yield excellent prints if you have good optics and with good processing of images Low light is quite good but resolution drops off as it does on all 24mp APS-C cameras, you can reduce the jpeg image size if you wish.So overall a pretty good entry level camera, it would be nice to see Nikon improve things a bit more esp in relation to the flash limitations and lack of bracketing (the last one has been a bit of a sore point for ages now) For the outlay it's capable of excellent results. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the D3200 was at launch.Is there more to buy? Well that's down to you, one reason for DSLR's being a popular choice is you have the flexibility to get lenses you need or might want (macro, telephoto, ultra wide angle) You can spend a fortune on equipment, or just buy a few lenses that interest you. Building up a system takes time and can be very expensive. So take it easy for a while and learn the basics first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWO6KI5OBSLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ4W1QE#wasThisHelpful","R3BWO6KI5OBSLB","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis grip from Neewer fills a bit of a gap for the DF which doesn't have a dedicated grip, whilst the battery life of the DF is excellent, this has the advantage of doubling up the battery (the battery tray takes 2 x EN-EL14a cells) but if you have a flash and heavier lens mounted vertical shots can be a bit unbalanced and it's here where I find grips most useful.Onto the grip itself it's very much in the normal style of SLR grips. Fitting is simple remove the battery door from the DF insert it into the door holder near the battery stem, push it into the battery compartment and tighten it up. You have a short cable with a jack that plugs into the grip near the latch, the other side connects to the remote release port on the DF this is required for the shutter release to work.Fit and finish the grip is good at this price point with decent plastics used. The latch on the battery cover is metal, you have a reinforced metal plate inside too where the bottom tripod thread is and this has a large rubber pad on the bottom to stop it slipping about. Couple of points I look for in grips firstly the thumbscrew where you tighten this up to the body it doesn't rattle that has been an issue on some grips I've used so pleased to see this isn't a problem. The other is how well it integrates with the body, the DF is a retro looking camera and this grip is a normal style but to my eyes it matches up quite well considering, the texture on the front and read rubber pads is coarser similar to the DF. The rear pad has a nice moulded section for your thumb to rest and it's comfortable to hold, on the front rubber it has a grooved area where your fingers fit a good secure feel.Now there are some limitations, firstly you only get a shutter release there are no control dials or buttons that's down to Nikon for not designing the DF for use with a grip. The other is that the SD card slot shares the same compartment as the battery so if you're taking the card out you will have to remove the grip; no idea why Nikon don't have a separate SD slot on the side but that's how they made the camera. Really it comes down to if you like using grips and for some types of shooting they do have a place.Can't really nit pick much on this (well packaged, instructions are clear and easy to follow), Neewer have done as good a job as you would expect for a model that hasn't been designed for a vertical grip (and if Nikon did a grip they'd charge a hefty amount for it) Worthy looking at if you have a craving for grip for the DF it's also keenly priced too.

"Note: The maker sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewModel: Neewer NW985CThis flash unit comes boxed with a clip on diffuser, a padded bag (with a section to store the flash stand) a flash stand with a brass thread and instructions. Third party flash makers have in recent times been “upping their game” offering more and more features on flash units that cost far less than OEM makers.This model has a significant important addition over some budget flashes, the ability to do HSS (high speed sync) older third party models were usually limited to manual or basic TTL, HSS can be very useful as it allows you to use fill flash at all shutter speeds (even above the cameras official sync speed) it does this by very fast strobe bursts, whilst range is limited it means you can use fill flash outside in bright light with faster lenses, and it can be useful for some flash tasks (which require a fast shutter speed)I've been testing the unit quite extensively and have rounded up a list of the stronger and weaker points of the flash unit.Good points:+ Solid build quality, tight joins on the flash body and metal shoe+ Operation is intuitive and straight forward very easy to grasp+ Large and bright LCD panel with colour coded display for flash functions good viewing angles+ Supports a wide range of features including E-TTL dedicated flash, TTL wireless flash, optical slave flash (with or without pre-flash suppression), “multi” strobe, flash bracketing and FEL (flash exposure lock) and full manual flash control (in 1/3 stop increments for fine tuning)+ Good bundle includes a well made padded case, diffuser and flash stand+ Mostly consistent exposure v a dedicated Canon flash (slight tendency to be about 0.5 EV half a stop under at times) easy to adjust output and not a huge problem+ Built in WA panel and white card+ High speed flash shooting is available at 1/16 output @12fps, supports rear curtain sync+ AF assist beam is quite effective (a sprayed out pattern of dots outside the central area)+ Audio signals (can also be turned off)+ Port to add external power pack+ Has a pc sync portWeaker points:- GN (power output) a bit lower than the headline figure I tested the output v a Metz 58 AF-2 (which is accurate) and calculated the actual GN to be about GN 48-50 (a bit less) still quite powerful just not as strong as some higher end units- Flash shuts down when it overheats (would be better to slow down the re-cycle times) see flash heat test below- Supplied diffuser a little fiddly to fitNotes:Manual power output is 1/128- 1/1 in 1/3 stop incrementsZoom can be set to “auto” (will zoom the head when you change the lens focal length or zoom) or manual from 18-180mmRe-cycle times at full power were about 3 seconds**Flash overheating test**I fired off 25 shots at full power (normal room temperature) and the flash started to emit a rapid beep, this was the overheat protection kicking in, it took about 3 minutes before the flash could be used again. Once the flash was operational I fired off another 17 shots and it took a fairly lengthy 8 minutes before it would let me fire the flash. You can change settings but you won't be able to use the flash until it's cooled down. In normal day to day use it's not that likely you will be firing the flash at full blast in rapid succession, so you might not encounter the overheating (to be fair even some expensive flashes will shut down) it is preferable though to slow down the re-cycle times rather than shut down.**What it doesn't have**Whilst the flash is well featured for it's price, there are a few points to note where some of the high end OEM makers units offer a bit more, firstly there is no “modelling light” this fires a burst of shots so you can see where the shadows are, you can mimic this mode by using the “Multi mode”The flash isn't weather sealed nor would I expect it to beIt can't act as a “Master” flash that is control other flashes via TTL, again at this price point it's not something I'd look for, but you can set the output manually and another optical slave flash controlling it that way**In use**Operation is simple the mode button cycles though the E-TTL mode, Manual, Multi (strobe) and Wireless. To enter the custom functions simply push and hold the central button (surrounded by the 4 buttons) and you can adjust settings like bracketing order, audio signals, AF light (HSS can be activated here) Using the 4 way controller/buttons you can cycle though the settings. A pilot light test fires the flash and lights when it's ready to fire. Holding down the on/off button controls the power.The supplied manual was easy enough to follow though the translations were quite poor in places fortunately the flash is intuitive to use and it won't take long to get the hang of itFlash head does not have a locking mechanism but is quite stiff moving it around at various angles very unlikely it will be knocked out of place easily**Wireless flash**There are 3 settings here E-TTL dedicated slave off camera flash this is a metered exposure and you can use multiple flashes in combination, you have 3 groups and four channels it's possible to set the zoom manually from 18-180mm.The other modes are “optical” off camera flash operation S1 fires the flash instantly when it sees a flash, S2 is “pre flash” delay if you are using the on-board or a TTL flash then this will have a pre-flash. This mode also allows you to use the flash with any other camera (even compacts)**Final thoughts**There are some niggles and points to note with this flash, but really considering the very low cost and overall strong feature set most of the compromises are unlikely to be a major problem.Both the build and bundle are impressive for such a low price, the flash performs well in use both on the hot shoe and in wireless mode with a good range on the optical sensor too. The addition of HSS sets this flash apart from other models, this usually is reserved for mid level OEM makers and you'd normally be looking to spend in the region of £200 to get that to see it on a flash at this price point would have been unthinkable a few years ago.With a few tweaks and improvements Neewer would have a top tier flashgun at a cracking price, as it is they've managed to get most of it right and this flash is very capable and does most of what a higher priced flash does for a fraction of the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8N0CVTM1PVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC9E522#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8N0CVTM1PVC","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a variety of Ni–MH batteries for a while now but for sheer reliability and longevity the Eneloop ones are hard to fault. This is the 4th generation of the Eneloop range the first coming to the market in around 2005, over time the number of charges has increased from the original 1000 cycles up to a claimed 2100 as well as extending the charge they retain in storage for longer. Since Panasonic took over Sanyo in 2013 the they retain the Eneloop branding, this model is BK-3MCCE the prior generation is HR-3UTGB the cycles up from 1800 on that model.It's easy to spot the newest model purely because they are Panasonic brandedThe cells are quoted as retaining up to 70% of their capacity for 5 years and are ready to use out of the boxI tested the pack I got and the capacities ranged from 2020-2078 mAh this can vary a bit but you're guaranteed a minimum of 1900 mAh. Unlike some other makers you can be sure you'll get the quoted capacity Despite the higher cost per battery the longevity of the Eneloop batteries has been very good I've had sets for a good while now (over 5 years) and they're still going strong where as some budget offerings have lost their capacity or worn out after a few years. I've also never had a problem with the Eneloop cells fitting, in the past a few makers have played around the standard AA size and some are a bit longer or larger in diameter this can cause problems on some devices fitting wise.On the packaging Panasonic recommend using their own chargers, but I've never had a problem with a good quality third party smart/intelligent charger with any make of battery it's well worth investing in one of these as it can extend the life of cells and avoid overcharging problems that some timer/manual chargers have.**A few chargers worth looking at**Maha MH-C9000 (very advanced high end charger)Powerex MH-C9000Technoline BL-700 or BC1000Foxnovo F-4SThe official Panasonic charger is: BQ CC16 this is an intelligent charger with individual monitoring and charging of cells, I don't recommend the basic BQ CC18 it works fine but it is timer control only.A decent budget 8 cell intelligent charger is the KooPower 8 Bay smart charger (this seems to be available in a few brand names same design though)Some of the top end chargers have multiple charging speeds and testing capabilities as well as discharge/re-fresh cycles. If you don't need these features then just go for a normal smart charger it's worth the small additional cost.There are some cheaper batteries out there, and some decent budget offerings too. But despite the higher cost this seems to be levelled out with the lifespan of the batteries. Hard to fault really a very reliable and solid offering and suitable for use in a wide variety of appliances even heavy drain items like flashes and digital cameras. For super high capacity users take a look at the Eneloop Pro range","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262WRDX77J97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHKSN4O#wasThisHelpful","R262WRDX77J97","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The supplier provided me with a review sample, no attempt was made to influence my opinion of the productThis alarm system is designed for mostly driveways but you can use it for other locations (maybe a shed or outer building or area where movement isn't expected)In the box you have a Receiver, Transmitter and 3 raw plugs and screws to fix both items. The included manual is well written and very clear in both operation and how to install the alarm.Firstly the receiver unit should be placed inside the house, this can run off of 3 x C 1.5v batteries ""or"" a power adapter rated at 6 volts max (this isn't included) You can wall mount it or it will stand up on it's own. On this unit you have 3 positions to set it to, off ""low"" and ""high"" the last 2 being the sound levels of the alarm. Personally I found the ""low"" setting to be good enough but if your receiver is placed in another location in the house you might want to set it to high.Now the main part the transmitter, this takes 3 x AAA batteries (no cells are included in this kit) and has a detection range of ""8m"" max, in field testing I found this to be accurate and it's certainly capable of working up to or near this distance. Actual range distance from the transmitter to the receiver is quoted as up to 100m for outside no obstructions I had no problems placing it down the garden and the receiver in various rooms the range is good on this unit.The transmitter sensor works off a passive ""heat"" and ""movement"" detection so this is where you need to think about where you will place it. In particular with pets and animals (birds for one) my cats frequently move around various parts of the driveway and shed and paths and they will set it off, even a strong burst of sunlight in a shadowy part can also at times trigger it (but not often) It's best to find a spot where there is less likely to be activity of any kind. The sensor covers about 100 degrees horizontal direction so firstly I experimented with height and you can avoid most cat/dog issues by making sure it's placed higher up a wall. But not so high that a person wouldn't trigger it, it didn't take too long to play around and find a suitable location.Consider wildlife too esp if you plan to fit it to a shed as birds and other animals can set it off. As the senor has a decent range spend a little time on the position and you'll get very good results.As this is a passive type of system (rather than active) the upshot is according to the maker much better battery life (they quote months, but I'll update the review on that if anything comes to light)In use I have to say once it's all set up (and it doesn't take that long, just the positioning of the transmitter takes more time) the system worked a treat with my testing the alarm fires off reliably and on the high setting you'll be sure to hear it. You could possibly use it as an internal alarm if you were away on holiday (works off the same type of sensor) but really it's for outdoors and I wouldn't say this model is a substitute for a full blown house alarm.Build wise the unit is well made and using decent plastics on the parts it feels like it would last the distance with normal use. For the fairly modest asking price it's a good system and easy to recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS0BE5W2PCKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPCNA9C#wasThisHelpful","R2GS0BE5W2PCKQ","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The manufacturer sent me a review sample no attempt was made to influence my reviewYou get quite a comprehensive bundle with this kit including the 7"" TFT LCD, the door bell/video camera unit as well as mounting plates for both. Also a decent bit of cable comes with it (I think enough for most users, but huge houses might need to extend it somewhat) There are some wall plugs and screws as well and the instructions which show you how to set it up and the various functions available on the unit.**LCD Unit**This has 4 touch screen buttons and 3 dials on the right hand side. The front controls allow you to accept a call, monitor the outside video, third one down means you can hook up an electronic door opening to the unit (this opens the door/gate) and an interphone is the last button allowing unit to unit communications (if you have other LCD units around the house)These buttons also ""double up"" (press and hold) allowing you to change the melody/ring tone, back button light on/off, and even a baby monitoring option.Right hand the 3 dials simply control the contrast, brightness and volume.The LCD display is very clear and easy to read a decent size 7"" with good resolutionOn the back you have the wiring connections and a bracket can slide on here to allow wall mounting*Doorbell/Video Unit""This is a nice quality thick solid metal with a brushed finish, you get a supplied backing plate for flush mounting, there is a single larger button for calling (this has a blue LED which turns on) above that the speaker, with the main camera surrounded by 3 LED's on each side, a small circle to the upper right is the microphone.On the reverse connections for the cable audio, video and power input as well as an electric lock input. You can adjust the speaker output and microphone sensitivity with a small screwdriver (the slots are recessed into the back of the doorbell unit)**Setting up and in use**I found it fairly simple to set up and the instructions were pretty good for the most part (though a few niggles on some areas)It's a simple as plugging in the supplied adaptor to the main LCD unit, and one part of the supplied cable and then using the push fit buttons on the back of the doorbell to provide power/video and sound. It's quite straight forward. Most of the work with a unit like this is going to be mounting and fitting the external doorbell, and the cable work, the actual hooking up is very easy to do. I don't have access to an electric door but the input and aux cable is provided for you if you want to add that.**Overall Quality**Build wise very little to complain about solid feel to both units, brushed metal bell is very strong and solid the LCD display isn't a thin as I might like but it's solid feeling and not at all fragile.Video and audio quality were very good, the wide angle lens gives a nice field of view and audio was clear both from the LCD to the main doorbell and vice versa. There are 16 selectable melodies including your usual ding dong bell (which I think is the choice for most) and some songs including some well known classical tracks even the theme tune to ""Titanic"" is here if that tickles your fancy! Not bad here I've never been a huge fan of melodies on door bells, but a selection is better than none.**Areas for improvement**The user manual is quite good, but some of the diagrams could be a bit larger same for the text a bit on the small size, for the most part it shows you the installation in an effective way.I'd prefer a dedicated onscreen menu you change the few settings there are by holding down the main 4 backlit touchscreen buttons, not that there are many settings to change, but a point to note. LCD unit isn't a thin as expected but it's far from bulky either.This isn't a cheap unit by any means, though the quality of the parts does feel a cut above some of the budget offerings I've seen and tried (no feeble plastics here) but this isn't for everyone you either want a video call doorbell or you don't.Wrapping things up a very nice unit with impressive build and quality all around, bar a few smaller niggles it's a quality offering for folks who are looking for a video door phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0YQVS7JSR1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEZULRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2C0YQVS7JSR1X","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these for a desktop PC, I've found adapters like this tend to work better than the cards you install inside the PC. One advantage of this model is you do get a bundled cradle this allows you to move the position around and improve the signal pickup, and it also avoids the problem of having a dongle poking out of the PC (which can be vulnerable to damage)For Windows computers this works with XP, Vista, 7, and 8 and is fully compatible with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHzThis isn't the fastest adapter out there it sits mid range, but it's plenty fast enough for most usesThe software is straight forward and it's easy to set up the adapter quickly. Once installed I had no problems with network connection, speeds were good and it picks up the Wi-Fi quickly after booting up. You do have a ""one touch"" connection button but I rarely use it.The only real complaint I have is the build quality the plastics creak a bit, the USB end doesn't feel that strong and there is a bit of play in it, likewise the cradle has some wiggle in the USB input socket. I've not had any problems to date with the performance or reliability but it does look like a weaker point of the product. I would suggest using the cradle as this will help to keep it tucked away from knocks or damage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1WXAVIAFU7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056OIBLU#wasThisHelpful","RU1WXAVIAFU7R","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hot shoe adaptor has a few uses, it's designed to fit the inverted hot shoe found on Minolta and Sony bodies. But do note that the new Multi Interface shoe has front contacts so whilst this will work with flashes that have the new hoe shoe it won't provide TTL. If you want to use TTL dedicated flashes with the newer multi interface shoe then you want the Sony ADP-AMA adaptor this offers full functionality for older flashes on the latest bodies (A77II, A99, A58 and newer E mount ILC bodies)The main advantages of this are:1: Allows you to use standard hot shoe flashes on i-ISO hot shoes (you won't get TTL though as all the contact layouts are different between makers and brands)2: Adds a PC sync port to your camera, only the semi pro level and up bodies have this but this adaptor will give provide one handy for lower end bodies3: If you're doing some video and want to shoe mount a standard ISO hot shoe microphone you can now do soBuild is good with decent plastics on the casing, the fit is firm on the cameras I tested it on. This has a button on the right hand side you press this in and pull it off to release it, it's an auto lock mechanism (locks as soon as it's fitted to the hot shoe)Whilst this does add a bit of height I didn't find any problems with durability with a flash mounted on top of the camera. It's worth having one of these around whilst you don't get TTL with other flashes you can use them in manual mode and the PC sync port is something worth having on it's own if you have bodies that lack this. It does the job well for it's intended purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6KVJ1Y9J4R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IPZRS0#wasThisHelpful","RQ6KVJ1Y9J4R2","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this looking for a ""smaller"" case for the Fuji X10 I bought recently. I have many larger cases and didn't really want anything too big, this is ideal size wise for that model you can fit the Fuji in no problems with the lens cap (you can fit it just about with the filter ring, but the hood is too big not a problem as I rarely use it) The Fuji X-A/M1 with a 27mm pancake will also fit in this as will some other premium compacts or ILC models. You've enough space to tuck the strap in too and zip it up, fit is excellent not too tight or loose. Internal Dimensions are 7.5 x 6 x 12.3 cm.Quality wise as expected from Lowepro very good, padding is decent, the double zip at the top has an inner lining so when zipped up the metal parts of the zip are cushioned from the camera. Inside in the top section is a small elasticated section to fit a spare SD card. Around the back you have a novel double Velcro belt strap so it's quite secure attaching it to a belt, and covering that another section which is also Velcro and padded but useful for horizontal attachment. In short both systems should allow you to attach this to photo belts, normal belts or other camera bags with no problems.You also get a shoulder strap which attaches to the fabric loops on the back.Very good little bag, but one minor niggle nowhere to really put a spare battery. You can if you wish put one inside the case (might need to leave the strap out), I'm not crazy about the idea of a battery knocking around inside though if you wanted to you could cover a battery in bubble wrap and put it in there. My solution was to use a neoprene CF card holder which fits the batteries I have for the X10 perfectly I just attach it to the hooks on the strap. A small point for improvement for Lowepro even a single outer mesh panel on the side would solve the ""where to put the battery"" issue. Or to make the case slightly taller and have another section inside the top part to fit a battery.Otherwise shove a spare in your pocket! The Lowepro Portland 30 has space for a battery but doesn't come with a should strap (which I use frequently)Small niggle aside it's a good quality case, which is priced fairly and manages to carry the camera in a small package (which was what I wanted) For other users do check the Lowepro site and use the bag finder to see what options you have for various models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GC972GRXO7EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OQUZEI#wasThisHelpful","R1GC972GRXO7EH","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker provided me with a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewUSB 3.0 hubs are quite common, but this model offers a built in LAN port in addition to the 3 USB 3.0 ports. You might wonder why that could be useful, but many ultra books or super compact laptops don't have a LAN port, some makers offer a USB to LAN this gives you the benefit of 3 ports plus the Ethernet.Cable length is about 30cm, this is really aimed at laptop users but you can plug it into a desktop though a USB extension cable might be needed.The top section has 3 LED's with the ports numbered 1-3 when a device is plugged in the corresponding number lights up, front section houses the 3 main USB 3.0 ports and the LAN socket is on the right side. Build is good with dense plastics a solid feel all round.I tested this on a number of Windows PC's this is simple plug and play for both the USB ports and the Ethernet you don't need drivers or a CD. It takes just a few seconds for the device to be recognised and it's ready to use. Whilst it's USB 3.0 it will work perfectly fine with USB 2 as well though without the speed advantage of the faster port.I connected up an external USB 3.0 hard drive to the hub and some USB memory sticks all worked perfectly there is enough power here to use a 2.5"" external hard drive though if you need multiple hard drives connected you might want to use a powered port. Ethernet supports 10/100/1000Mbps and supports wake on LAN and cross-over detection.A very useful hub to have if you are short on laptop USB ports or if you have an ultra book you get the benefit of the extra USB and the built in LAN","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NRRH615L15V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFEB7K2#wasThisHelpful","R37NRRH615L15V","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The manufacturer sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis is quite an interesting concept rather than just having a normal iPhone case this one doubles up as a wallet and card holder too.Opening up the gift box (it comes in a nice black box) there is the immediate odour of quality leather and examining the case be in no doubts this is a high end product.The leather is of very fine quality I have a few Italian leather products myself this is a harder wearing type of leather but with age leather tends to develop a more subtle feel. Inside the case it's lined with a fine felt, the surrounding plastic section also feels dense and strong with cut out sections for the volume controls on the side the lower ports and a gap for the camera on the phone.Moving onto the ""leather part"" you have a front section which can hold a card and a few bank notes, this is stamped with the Huskk logo. Around the edges the bottom part has a section that's attached to the plastic case to prevent items slipping out you also have 2 of these on the left hand side, one on the bottom right part and at the top a magnetic section that closes off the top of the ""wallet section"". On the back of the plastic there is the Huskk logo and name stamped into this area.The main wallet section can easily hold quite a lot of cards the maker suggests 8 that's not unrealistic but will largely depend on how much cash you have in there too or bits of paper/business cards etc. Design wise it works and it works very well this really is an alternative to a wallet except in one obvious area, you can't really carry coins (unless you put a few in the front pouch area) In terms of fitting with the iPhone it's spot on nice and secure when pushed inNow I've tested quite a lot of iPhone cases and they vary hugely in price and quality, this is no question a high end offering for any phone case, I'm not in any doubt about the quality of the product the leather is top tier, the construction and design are to a similar standard. I've not touched a case that's a classy, refined or well made as this. On the other hand the price is a factor (it is expensive no question) and well my only concern is leather of this grade and quality can last decades and only gets better with age it's a shame that it will easily outlast the phone itself. I'm slightly torn on rating here as the product is a 5 star one easily (materials are superb the design is strong in fact quite unique turning a phone case into a wallet thinking outside of the box as some would say and to great effect), it really comes down to the price in the end.The quality of the product is there no doubt about it this isn't a passing purchase and not for everyone (plenty of more affordable cases out there some are quite good) But as my title suggests this is a case that demands respect, and among iPhone cases it is without question ""the boss"" of them all","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKS2WSQZF4O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXFR944#wasThisHelpful","R1BKS2WSQZF4O5","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewI've looked at quite a lot of Bluetooth speakers and this one is a little unusual in appearance, but I have to say I like the look of it. The cube is 9cm in all dimensions finished with a soft touch effect. On the bottom the entire area is covered with a rubber pad this stops the cube slipping around and probably helps with the acoustic side too.Top deck houses the main controls in a contrasting silver effect volume up/down track back/forward and the play/pause button which doubles up as the accept/reject/end call function. On the rear an input for a 3.5mm aux jack and the micro USB charging port.You get a supplied male to male 3.5mm lead and the micro USB to normal USB port for charging. It takes around 5-6 hours to charge the cube up from flat.**In use**Paring up just select ""magic cube"" and off you go make sure you disconnect the previous device if it's in range of the cube. Connection was strong and I got over 15 metres range from a tablet (this might vary depending on the device used) range is well above average for a Bluetooth speaker. Built in microphone did a decent job and calls were very clear so no complaints on the phone call aspect of the speaker.I ran the cube for an extended time and the battery was still not flat so I don't doubt the makers claims of 20 hours at moderate volume levels, this is quite a lot more than most Bluetooth speakers are capable of usually they're good for 6-8 hours rarely above that.**Audio quality**Looking nice and having a good range/battery life is all well and good but the really important part for any acoustic speaker is if it delivers the goods in the sound department. This varies a lot with speakers most sound quite good, a few sound really good. The Avantek cube is probably the best sounding Bluetooth speaker relative to it's size I've heard to date. Sound is clean, crisp and extremely well balanced with strong vocals, a deep bass and clear treble. The sound surprised me somewhat as it outperformed my expectations for a speaker this size. Someone has sat down and really paid attention to this part of the cube.Volume levels are good, it can kick out a loud enough sound, but all too often I hear distortion or parts of the range breaking up. No such worries here, a smooth and detailed sound and not a hint of problems.**Areas for improvement**It's hard to nit-pick with the cube but if I were to think of a couple of areas for improvement it would be possibly a micro SD slot or USB input, some speakers have built in radios too but I'm splitting hairs really because the other areas are really very strong on this product. I am pleased to see an Aux 3.5mm input though as this is very useful to add other non Bluetooth devices to the speaker.**Conclusion**I'm very impressed with the cube in a lot of ways it's well made with an attractive design, instructions are clear and easy to follow as is operation. It has a bigger than normal range and an outstanding battery life for a Bluetooth speaker. To top it all off it sounds great and delivers a really impressive sound that's warm and complete. For it's size/class and price it's one of the best sounding speakers I've listened to, An excellent speaker and very highly recommended without reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KVRQQCXT4MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTG2Q6A#wasThisHelpful","R31KVRQQCXT4MV","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fact based story is one of a love triangle created on-line that has devastating consequences in real life. Thomas Montgomery is a former US Marine, now in his later 40's with a family, but a dull boring life compounded with problems, he escapes into a fantasy world in an on-line gambling game and chat room via his ""marinesniper"" on-line name.He meets Talhotblond in the chat rooms (the screen user name of an 18 year old girl) and plays out a life where he is a young marine and thus able to appeal to a much younger woman. Soon rivalry shows up in the shape of Brian Barrett (beefcake is his user name) , a co-worker Thomas knows in person.Ultimately this is a story of tragedy with the pointless loss of a life over a love triangle which never existed in the real world. Later on the shocking truth about Talhotblond is revealed, all is not as it seems.The film starts unusually with a voice over from the victims perspective, we have interviews with Montgomery, Rex Beaber a Clinical Psychologist, several case detectives as well as Brian's parents. Tim Shieler who is the father of the girl in question, is quite visibly shaken and emotional during his interview scenes. The documentary is well produced, though has quite a lot of the text used during the conversations on-line (much of which is unsuitable for younger viewers due to the graphic nature of the messages), a little slow to start but it picks up mid point.This film certainly makes you ponder about the dangers of posing as someone you are not, the tragic elements are in many directions, a mentally ill man who takes his compulsion out on a fellow co-worker, the girl whom neither man has met, and the final details about the exact identity of the girl in question really throws an unexpected punch. Fantasy and reality clash in this sad but true story where nothing is as it seems, and nobody should have been hurt or killed. Certainly worth a watch if true crime stories are an interest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7RLW2RX3FQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036K9CVO#wasThisHelpful","R1T7RLW2RX3FQ9","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is something a bit different and might not appeal to everyone but this drama holds quite a good storyline that does provide you with plenty to ""think about"" and that's a good sign for the most part. At times it can be a little slow and pondering, but there are some fine performances from the cast and the story is something most of us can relate to.I quite like Joaquin Phoenix he's certainly a capable actor and this role works well for him. Here he plays Leonard Kraditor somewhat of a loner Leonard is a keen photographer and has recently had some difficult moments. The opening scenes show Leonard attempting to end his life (but in a half hearted way and abandons the idea), it becomes clear he's had bad luck in his life romance wise.His parents are naturally concerned and arrange for him to meet up with the daughter of his father's business partner (Vinessa Shaw who plays Sandra Cohen) the two seem to get along fine and they arrange a future meeting with a view to dating. However Leonard soon meets neighbour Michelle Rausch (Gwyneth Paltrow) and strikes up a friendship which soon turns into something which captivates Leonard, he's torn between his potential ""nice/sensible but not that exciting "" girlfriend and the new found Michelle who is the exact opposite, outgoing, likes to party hard, very pretty/sexy (Vinessa Shaw is an attractive woman but she's been deliberately under made up for the film) Leonard is somewhat hooked with the attraction and fast pace of Michelle.Unfortunately for Leonard the girl he likes most is Michelle, but there are complications namely she is involved with a married man by the name of Ronald Blatt (Elias Koteas) I won't spoil the plot by giving away too many details, just to say Leonard has to make a choice between the evasive and hard to pin down, and ""complicated/with problems"" Michelle, or the rather less interesting but kind hearted Sandra as he tried to juggle relationships with both women.I liked the film for a few reasons firstly the cast on all levels are very good Joaquin has that deep intensity that makes Leonard believable as a character, and both female roles are played equally well and contrast the differences between the two women. Direction is solid, leisurely paced at times, script is strong as is screen play. I personally like the ending it's something that's a bit unique in that Leonard ends up with one girl not really by choice but how events are played out and has no real control, it leaves things a little uncomfortable for the viewer, but then I'd rather that then a production that was obvious story wise from the start.Not going to be everyone's cup of tea that's for certain, but if you like a slower moving considered but intriguing romance drama this could be worth a look. Quite a lot better than I expected, partly down to the strong cast though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHO7YYIHJC7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RJ1Y62#wasThisHelpful","RPHO7YYIHJC7W","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I was provided with a paperback copy of the book for review evaluation, the opinion of the publication is my own personal viewChris Parker's story features a serial killer on the rampage pursued by a detective called Peter Jones an experienced investigator whose skills are tested to the limit as the bizarre murders unfold; he is forced to turn to a friend ""Marcus Kline"" a man of great perception and expert on ""influence"" in order to bring the killer to justice.This is quite an intense read (some readers will like this others may prefer a more traditional crime thriller) and I wouldn't want to spoil the story with too much detail. Whilst the plot is good it is really the character development and interaction that is first class we explore many sub plots in the novel which intertwine with the main storyline, this makes for an unusual read this isn't a standard detective story by any means.You will straight away notice that the author is something of an expert in this field, but do not let the theoretical explanations put you off. It took me a few pages to get into the book. but it was absolutely worth it. The characters are well developed varied and unusual; the story is well paced and you will not find the culprit that easily, this one gives very little away and feels all the better for it. An impressive book and one that really stands out in this crowded genre. If part two is up to this level this should make for an outstanding trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJDMXVAF5N76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHRMG9S#wasThisHelpful","R1YJDMXVAF5N76","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The maker provide me with a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewChamois leather cloths are well regarded for their soft non scratching and highly absorbent properties but this offering is remarkably similar to the real product (the term Chamois refers to the species of goat whose skin is used for the leather) This animal friendly product is made from PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) and comes in an oval box the cloth is sealed in a bag open this up and it's slightly damp and soft to the touch.The maker recommends washing it and line drying it, and that it's best to store the towel/cloth slightly damp in the container. Just like the real thing this will dry up though you can re-fresh it's feel and properties by making it damp.At just over two foot long this is a good size to have though some might prefer to cut it in half to make two cloths. One side of the towel has a dimple effect on it, the other is smooth in appearance. In use this works just as the normal leather one does and is esp useful for leaving a streak free finish on car paintwork or windows/mirrors. Being highly absorbent this can soak up water quickly and this is part of the reason for the non watermarked finish. It's also strong resisting tearing very wellIn a blind test I'd say it would be near to impossible to tell this apart from the leather one it's that good and using it for cleaning and washing it's basically on par with the traditional Chamois to the point I really can't see any need to hunt one of those out. It's always good to see a maker come up with an alternative material which is up to the job in this case it's fully deserving of praise.I've used a few synthetic cloths that tout themselves as being a Chamois alternative this one lives up to that claim.

"Note: I was sent a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis mount includes the waterproof casing and suction cup but with a quick release allowing you to take the WR casing off.Inserting the cue you have a double safety latch on the side compartment you have to move the switch and then pull the latch open, once that's done you insert the cube, the fit is good thanks to some pads on the back compartment which stop the cube rattling around. Reverse the procedure and the cube is now contained in a WR section. On the back door is a rubber seal whilst I've not had any problems with use I'd suggest checking this for debris every time you use the cube just to be on the safe side.A button on the top section allows you to take photos/start and stop video.The bottom suction mount is rotated to lock it into place, there is a tab to help removal of the suction part. Once it's locked in the it's very firm and worked very well on glass or other shiny surfaces. If you're mounting it on a car body then I would advise you to clean the mounting area with a cloth just to make sure you have a good contact with the surface. It's important to note that once the suction is mounted there is no rotation possible so ensure it's lined up properly, the top section can still be tilted up/down though which is pretty handy for getting a good angle on footage.Overall I liked this mount it's solid, well made and the suction cup sticks very well when locked in. Whilst the cube has a degree of weather resistance it can't be submersed in water this allows you to use the cube in harsh weather or under water. The maker claims depths of 10 metres I didn't test it that far down but it didn't have any water leakage problems at a depth of about 3 metres during field testing.Recommended for cube users who want a decent WR case","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCDQO76A6UMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7TH7JW#wasThisHelpful","RQCDQO76A6UMM","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I was sent a review sample for evaluation the opinion of the product is my own personal viewThis ""bike mount"" lets you attach the cube with a clip on attachment, you get two rubber pads provided (one spare) this slots inside the mount (with a bobble moulded on it to prevent it moving) The top section rotates and has click stops to adjust to the position you want. On both sides there are tabs which when pressed in allow you to remove the top section. The cube itself clicks into place on the top part.A few thoughts on this mount, firstly the cube clicks into place pretty firmly I wasn't worried about it popping out. The snap on section I have not had a problem with, but if you are doing vigorous off road mountain biking it could get knocked off position or off the bars. It holds firmly enough for normal road cycling. I did find the quick release a bit fiddly to remove though for some reason it didn't always come off easily even with both tabs pushed in.I'd also prefer a normal mount which can be secured completely with a locking mechanism, this would ensure that the mount just can't come off at all and would be a better design, the quick release would allow you to take it off quickly.

"I've a good range of SD cards and have tested most of them to date, I vary the brands as it makes it easier for me to find cards that are empty or that I use with specific cameras.This Sony card is a UHS-I class, so can take advantage of some devices that support this protocol (it's fully backward compatible with non UHS cameras etc). The headline figure though is only for the read performance which can be a little misleading for some buyers. The card is far from slow overall, but it's a bit behind the SanDisk Extreme 45MB/s offering in terms of in camera write speed. It is though quite a lot faster for reading and file transfer so weight up what your requirements are first.I benched the Sony card using a USB 3.0 card reader and using software I got close results from real world file sizes (video and photo) to the benchmark I ran.Read speed: 87MB/sWrite Speed: 38MB/sA bit of variation from test to test (a few MB/s either side) on paper the Sony is near enough to it's claimed max speed for reading files. The Extreme 45 MB/s does write a bit faster though (over 45MB/s as indicated and it hits that speed for read times too) Really it comes down to what you need.If you need faster in camera speeds (which most do) then the Extreme 45 MB/s is quicker, if you want even faster speeds then the 80 MB/s is the one to go for (that card writes a lot quicker than both) super speed demons might want the Extreme Pro series or equivalent offerings.The Sony isn't a slow card when compared to a normal class 10 quite a lot faster really, and does have the advantage of a toughened casing which is less prone to damage being waterproof, x ray proof, shock proof just like the Extreme range offer. Warranty is a bit less than I'd like at 5 years Sony should really increase that to come into line with rivals. There is a newer version of this card out (and it's evidently even faster) As it is if you transfer big files a lot this is fast, it's quite fast in camera too just not as quick as some other offerings. That doesn't make the Sony a bad card but it would be a lot more helpful if they just told you what the speeds for both were.Worth a look at the right price if it's quick enough and you need some protection from rough handling or the environment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNBEOXM9GRXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9V5GJI#wasThisHelpful","RUNBEOXM9GRXC","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fujinon 16-50mm is bundled with various X mount camera kits but also available to purchase on it's own.Being an XC lens it doesn't feature the aperture ring of XF Fujinon lenses (aperture is controlled via the camera control dials), and the barrel is devoid of an OIS on/off switch.Despite being a ""kit lens"" a few points stand out, firstly the build is somewhat better than most kit offerings with dense more solid feeling plastics used, neither is there a hint of any wobble with the lens extended and the zooming action is smooth from wide to telephoto end. The mount is plastic, the copy I am reviewing came with an X body kit and included a hood, supplied is a push on rear lens cap, and a centre pinch front lens cap.After testing the lens I've listed out some of the stronger and weaker points of the lensGood points:+ Very good sharpness across the focal range in the centre even wide open, at 16mm f3.5 edge performance is very good improving a bit stopping down, very usable at 50mm f5.6 too. Corners are a bit behind the central performance at 24-35mm but still very acceptable wide open.+ Build is a step up from most kit lenses with decent plastics used in construction+ Useful focal range offering an equivalent of 24-75mm on a full frame camera+ Compact size, weight under 200 grams pairs well with some of the smaller ""X"" series cameras+ Autofocus is quiet and fast to acquire focus (this will vary on the body being used) no issues with AF to report+ Effective OIS system means slower lens speed can be compensated to a degree, I'd estimate 3.5-4 stops from the OIS+ Fairly good out of focus rendering, quite smooth 7 blades rounded apertureNot so good:- Cost is high for a lens of this type when bought outside a kit bundle, for the asking price it should really have a metal mount- Some CA at the wide end edges even with correction (not extreme by any means)- No aperture ring or OIS switch (both are controlled via the camera body), would prefer a ""real rear lens cap""- Rather mediocre close up performance min focus distance is 0.3m (at the 50mm end) Magnification of 1:6.7 (0.15x)Notes:Optical distortion and vignette (darkening of the corners) and most aberrations are corrected in camera and in most common raw converters (the bundled Fuji software and well known products like ACR/Lightroom) In most cases you won't see the effects of this at all even working in raw, but you can if you use some of the lesser well known raw conversion software out there. There is a fair bit of distortion esp wide end being corrected and darkening in the corners, but it's mostly invisible to the user and likely a non issue, but worth a mention anyway just in case you use other software for your raw workflow.Filter size is 58mm the front element does not rotate on focus or zooming, the lens extends about 3.3cm at the 50mm positionLens zoom and focus rings are made of the same plastic as the casingAperture varies across the focal range the approx. lens speed is as follows:16mm F3.518mm F3.620mm F3.823mm F425mm F4.228mm F4.530mm F4.735mm F540mm-50mm F5.6Lens speed is typical for a lens of this class though the benefit of good OIS and the ISO performance of the X series bodies does dampen the loss of speed somewhat.There is no focus distance scale on the lens but this shows up on the camera which can be of use. Manual focus is ""by wire"" thus electronic response fairly good though I would prefer a mechanical focus action (which feels better in my view)Probably the most interesting aspect of this lens is unlike some other ""kit"" offerings which usually start at 18mm (roughly 27mm on a 1.5x crop body) The Fuji offers a very nice wide angle equivalent of 24mm which could be of interest for scenic and landscape shooters, with the 50mm taking you up to a normal short telephoto 75mm on a full frame body. The range is without question very appealing even if the lens speed isn't fast. There is quite a difference between an 18mm lens and a 16mm one more than you would expect, the real issue with the lens has less to do with optics but price. I was pleasantly surprised by the lens resolution which is to a level few kit lenses reach, though not perfect this lens is unlikely to disappoint even fussy shooters (it compared well to a Tamron 17-50mm f2.8 when I shot both side by side)The one let down is the max magnification which really is a bit below par compared to other lenses I've used the Fuji can't focus as close as most zoom lenses (the 16-50mm is 0.15x the Tamron 17-50mm can manage 0.22x which is quite acceptable), though it might be adequate for some types of shooting a low cost option would be to add a close up filter to bring the lens closer to the subject.Cost wise I think Fujifilm need to look again at the lens I think most buyers will pay a bit more for the extra wide end,  either that or Fuji should have included the aperture ring and a metal mount (this would have offset the price to a point) Still if you do manage to pick one of these up it's a lens that offers quite a lot and is in it's own right a capable zoom lens that will find quite a bit of use as a standard zoom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA648OU6XS9SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EK1E2RM#wasThisHelpful","RA648OU6XS9SR","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fuji X-M1 sits in the entry segment of the X series models but this one has the unique X-Trans CMOS sensor (the X-A1 has a normal bayer sensor) in other areas though these models are the same (controls/functions etc)Being an entry model there are a few compromises here, firstly the most obvious one is the lack of viewfinder, secondly controls have been streamlined over higher end models and this doesn't feature the newer on sensor phase detect autofocus of the X-T1 (contrast AF here) despite this the camera still manages to achieve a very small size (very similar to the X10/20 compacts in fact slightly smaller) and it has most of the important requirements aspiring shooter might want.I've been testing the camera extensively for a while now and made up a quick fire list of some of the better points and weaker areas of the camera. The camera is a good one overall though like most cameras does have some areas that could be better.Good points:+ Excellent image quality easily as good if not better than equivalent rivals (with a similar sensor size) Tonality is very appealing and attractive (very subjective but I like it)+ Huge latitude in raw files both highlight and shadow end with outstanding low light performance very minimal noise+ Build is solid despite being plastic feels well put together no poor joints or creaking at the seams+ Full manual controls quite good customisation and menus+ Autofocus is good for accuracy in most cases (it's reasonably quick though can't match DSLR's for speed)+ Start up is quick and the camera is responsive with no signs of lag+ Fairly good buffer around 10 shots raw and about 31 jpegs at full resolution, able to take some advantage of faster cards too+ Continuous shooting rate of 5.6fps is decent (note the points about AF)+ Large clear 3.0” LCD is the same aspect ratio as the sensor (3:2) and sharp with a 920k resolution as well as partially articulated (up and down positions) option to brighten it up for daylight shooting (it's a bit reflective though quite clear in most light)+ Battery life is quite good for a compact sized camera (I got about 390 shots per charge) flash use will shorten this+ Q menu is well laid out and avoids trips into the main menu system for most common settings+ Fn button can be user set, C position on the mode dial allows for a memory of settings to be stored (shame it is only one)+ Hot shoe allows the use of dedicated flashes or other accessories, built in flash extends a decent bit though power is a little low (GN 7)+ Consistent metering and white balance required little intervention for most shooting+ Excellent flash exposures (though will increase the ISO if you let it a little too much)+ Manual focus “peak” is useful though could use more colours (red/yellow)+ Video is acceptable for a consumer level camera reasonable details and resolution and decent microphone quality, limited options though (you can set aperture before you start but not adjust it during recording) see cons on “moire”+ Good in camera raw conversions you can adjust quite a few settings too (this creates jpegs from raw files but it's handy to have)Weaker areas:- No viewfinder, and no option to add one, no AEL button (Fn can be programmed for this)- Continuous autofocus/tracking is weak (cannot re-focus after the first shot on cont AF) not a good choice for sports/action shooters (though with pre-focus techniques and some skill it might work)- Raw not available for ISO 100 or above ISO 6400 (jpeg only)- Jpegs overly contrasty by default and don't exploit the dynamic range of the sensor (adjusting the shadow/highlights to -1/-2 helps quite a lot) tendency to crush blacks- Macro button fairly pointless (would be better to have a Fn 2 custom button)- Battery/memory card slot is covered when on a tripod you can't change either (poor location)- Card write light covered by your thumb- Video shows moire and false colours when repeating patterns are in footage- No dedicated button for ISO (you can set the Fn button to this), movie button cannot be re-programmed- No “sweep panoramic mode” and no level gauge both are strange omissions, black and white doesn't have the filters either (red/yellow etc)- 3 scene modes on the mode dial are wasting space, better to put them all in the SP setting (where the other scene modes are) This area would be better reserved for extra user settings- “Top” control dial is a bit easy to move (can mean exposure compensation is engaged by accident)- Flash exp compensation buried in the main menu cannot be assigned to the Fn1 button- Wi-fi has limited use you can send images to devices (even a pc if the software is installed) you can Geotag images too, you cannot control the camera via the Fuji remote app which is disappointing. No option to turn this off (which could conserve battery power)- No electronic shutter (full mechanical) though it's not obtrusive sound wiseNotes:If you don't have any lenses the “kit” 16-50mm F3.5-F5.6 is well worth getting I've done a separate review on this lens it's very good optics wise and offers a nice wider angle field of view (equivalent to 24mm)Unlike some compacts there is no built in memory so you'll need an SD cardRaw files average at around 24MB, which is on the large side for a 16mp cameraVideo:You have a choice of only two resolutions 1920 x 1080 @ 30fps this is for some reason limited to 14 minutes time1280 x 720 is also @30fps but recording time is 27 minutes.AF is available in continuous though it does fine don't expect miracles esp in lower light or tracking it's not unsatisfactory for this type of camera though. Moire and false colours are an issue so this isn't going to really suit very serious video shooters, but it does fine for quick clips.The supplied strap is a thin “pleather” type affair it does the job (same as the X10/X20 cameras) but a fabric one is preferable.Dynamic range modes:There are Auto, 100%, 200%, 400%The camera will raise the ISO levels up to ISO 800 for DR 400%, (and ISO 400 for DR 200%)In most cases DR Auto does a good job, but DR 200% is fairly safe too the camera won't show massive noise problems at all even at ISO 800.You do get some useful ""one touch"" controls if you press and hold the following buttons in:DISP/BACK: this engages the ""quiet mode"" this disables the sounds/flash if raised and the AF assist lightQ Button: Brightens the LCD to high levels for use in harsh sunlightMenu/OK: This locks the 4 buttons around the Middle Menu button (and disables the video button) to stop accidental button pressesWhen the X-M1 first arrived last year it was fairly expensive and that might have put people off trying one, however fast forward about to the present time it's now at levels similar to budget DSLR's. In terns of what's on offer this is a solid offering, but bear in mind that the main advantages of this are the smaller size compared to a DSLR, it can't offer the same autofocus performance and that's an important point for moving subjects, also the size advantage tends to disappear once you use larger focal length lenses (which are no smaller than their DSLR equivalents) Look at what you needs are. If you're a heavy phone user and want a big step up in quality, the sensor in this camera will destroy even the most expensive phone camera, with ease.There is a 27mm f2.8 pancake lens which when paired with this body makes for a very compact machine (albeit with a fixed focal length) I've yet to test that lens but it's an option for some if you want to keep the size down.The biggest attraction is probably the sensor which is very capable and responds well to raw processing, it's certainly a huge step up from a tiny sensor compact in image quality. Even premium compacts will fall behind this, but bear in mind when paired with the 16-50mm lens you don't have very good close up ability and the lens is slower esp the telephoto end. If you shoot a lot of macro or close up photos a premium compact with a fast lens might be a better choice.On the other hand if you are into experimenting a little you can acquire a lens adapter and though manual focus and aperture control you can mount and use many lenses (there is an M mount Fuji adapter available and lots of third party ones for other lens mounts) this means that even if you are invested in an SLR system you could find a use for this body with your lenses. For newer users or those keen to keep the size down this is a very viable alternative to a DSLR, but it's not for everyone (action shooters) Grip wise a little small here I find a DSLR more comfy to hold for longer periods, everyone is unique though small suits some better than others.Couple of odd points firstly leaving out the sweep pano and some of the newer film effects (and B&W filters) strikes me as strange considering the target market for the camera, it's also a shame to see no electronic level gauge this featured on the X series compacts. Controls are fairly logical though would benefit from an additional Fn button to program, you also can't turn off the “guide” which might annoy some more seasoned users (this describes the scene/modes on screen) Wi-fi is under exploited and Fuji could look at this not having remote control of a Wi-Fi camera is puzzling. The rear control dial is in an unusual location and takes a while to get used to, it also can be pushed for some settings as well as rotated.At the default settings jpegs are a bit harsh for my liking (too much contrast and dynamic range is a bit weak) adjusting the shadow/highlight tone helps no end. It's also worth experimenting with the DR settings to get the best out of the camera. If you are working with raw then the X-Trans CMOS has some impressive latitude in both ends able to recover highlights and pull shadows aggresively without a major impact on images. Either way jpeg and raw shooters will be impressed with the cameraI would like to see a few things tweaked and maybe Fuji will get around to adding a sweep pano and some more film modes. The lack of viewfinder is a shame too even a basic one would be welcomed (or the option to add one) it’s down to personal use on that with lighter smaller lenses the lack of viewfinder isn't a massive loss (it's certainly easier to hold a camera stability wise with a viewfinder), but it becomes awkward if you start to use heavier or longer focal lengths.Overall the X-M1 is a very decent offering and certainly likely to appeal a lot more at this price level, despite the flaws it's a capable camera and more than able to hold it's own image quality is as good as you can get with an APS-C sensor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13HHLGURFEIW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCM0E5Y#wasThisHelpful","R13HHLGURFEIW5","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was quite interested to try this lens out as I've used the equivalent ones from Canon and Sony (18-135mm)I also owned the ""super kit"" 18-105mm Nikkor which was quite good (my copy anyway) but struggled a bit with newer high resolution sensors.Overall the lens is better than I expected, but has a few compromises as all ""bigger zoom"" lenses tend to. But importantly I feel these don't detract from a very decent offering from Nikon here (and the price is much more sensible right now)Summary of good and badPros:+ Very useful 27- 210mm equivalent (7.8x zoom) very handy for a general purpose lens+ Price is much more appealing over initial release (it's pretty fair for what you get)+ Lens sharpness is good esp central region across the focal range even at 140mm f5.6 (it's surprisingly sharp here)+ Build is fine for a lens in this price range, plastics are of reasonable quality and about what I expect.+ Has a metal mount+ Front element does not rotate during focus or zoom+ AF is fast and quiet, it's a good bit speedier than the older 18-105mm I had (which was about average)+ Fairly decent close focus ability at 1:4.2 magnification (140mm end) 0.23x or (0.45m) which isn't bad at all. It's not a genuine macro by any means but good enough for closer focus work+ CA isn't a serious issue mostly well controlled+ VR performance is strong as expeced around 3.5 - 4 stops+ Full time manual focus with Nikon's AF-S AF motorCons:- Fairly hefty distortion at the 18mm mark (not unexpected for a lens like this)- Pincushion is notable moving up the zoom range from about 40mm and is still fairly visible at the 140mm mark. I do feel it's not as strong as the 18-105mm was at the tele end though. This can be corrected in camera or later in post- Vignetting an issue at the wider end and at F3.5, stop it down to around F5.6 it mostly clears up, also at the tele end too (you can correct this in camera for jpeg or via software)- Extreme corners don't quite reach the same level of central sharpness (which is really excellent), stopping down does help a bit here. This is a common compromise on lenses of this range (same on the Canon and Sony lenses I've used). I don't think it's a serious issue (they are not super soft or blurred)- Focus ring could be a bit tighter (small bit of play)- 67mm filter size isn't a common one- No lens hood included, should be really for the price (HB-32 hood is the one you are after same as the 18-70/18-105mm etc)Other notes:VR mode is simply on/off no setting for ""active"" for panning etc, not a huge problem but worth a mentionNo zoom lock is provided, if zoom creep is an issue later on hard to say the zoom feels quite stiffThe 18-140mm isn't a light lens (490g) making it a bit heavier than the Canon/Sony equivalents. Still it's a ""lot"" lighter than the 18-300mm and 18-200mm lenses, of course less range but there are some important advantages.Optics wise, the lens is significantly sharper then the 18-55mm kit lens (esp for 16/24mp sensors), it's also a solid step up over the older 18-105mm (which started to struggle with 16mp and higher sensors) All things being equal I think that the range covered is big enough for many users and for a one fits all general purpose (some say walk about) lens.It's also a better lens in my view than the 18-200mm and 18-300mm lenses (and much more appealing price), and better overall in terms of optics. You get less range, but importantly less compromises. It's able to maintain good image quality and sharpness across the range which is something neither of the other lenses can really manage (both have some notable weaker focal lengths)At the newer more sensible price, this is a good lens that many users will find very useful to have. Obviously it's not a fast lens, and won't replace your faster primes for lower light work, I'd just put that 35/50mm f1.8 in the bag if you need it. But for out and about shooting, general purpose or as a super kit lens upgrade it's well worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHDS4U2B5H1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFR1DFI#wasThisHelpful","R1MHDS4U2B5H1K","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read some online reviews on this lens I noted Kurt Munger's review and didn't feel inspired by what I saw. However having had the opportunity to try the lens myself I can report that the lens is almost an entirely different animal to the online review I read.I wasn't exepecting much, but it has to be said this is really a very good lens on an optical level and offers a very useful focal range.I'll start with my pros and cons list as per usual, please see the uploaded images for real world examples at various focal lengths.Pros+ Very useful equivalent on an APS-C camera of 27-202mm+ Sharpness is excellent in the central region at all apertures and focal lengths (and good across most of the frame) bar extreme corners (at 18mm my samples was very good across the entire frame with just very slight softening in the extreme right and left areas, though only a little)+ Good build quality, in fact almost very good. Nice quality plastics, decent hood, metal mount (aluminium). The zoom ring and MF ring are smooth and tight fitting.+ Has a lens zoom lock at the 18mm mark, useful if needed possibly later on+ Superb contrast and colour rendition, Sony really nailed it here.+ New SAM motor is surprisingly fast in operation (though not entirely silent)+ Not too heavy for a walk around lens, and size is quite compact with a 62mm filter+ CA is well controlled and rarely an issue. Some pincushion tele end (stronger at 50mm but not much at 135mm) quite a bit less than say a Nikkor 18-105mm. Vignetting not a serious issue (can be seen in some cases ie bright sky but it's not much overall)+ Full time manual focus/DMF with the focus ring (simlar to Nikon's AF-S lenses) Rotates freely in either direction, mechanical focus not focus by wire (which is good!)+ In most cases background out of focus areas had a fairly pleasant blur effect which I found better than average and better than the Nikkor 18-105mm I used to own, smoother transitions and more pleasing (subjective of course) Rounded aperture blades might help a bit too.+ Front element does not rotate on focus, 62mm filter shared with a few other lensesCons:- SAM motor is a fair bit quieter than previous SAM lenses I've used, and screw drive lenses, but it's not silent and it's clearly audible (mostly if the AF goes through the entire range, it's pretty quiet for small AF adjustments) Bear this in mind with video shooting (ie with normal background noise likely to not be noticed, for quiet areas an off camera microphone might be advised). An improvement but it's not SSM or AF-S Nikkor quiet.- Fairly hefty barrel distortion at the 18mm mark, not unexpected for a lens of this type (can be corrected in camera or in post)- Min focus distance is about average (not really a con just worth a mention) around 0.25x good enough for close up shots though.- Some softness at f5.6 towards the tele end but only in the far edges and extreme corners, central area is very sharp still at f5.6 (and about 90% of the frame is very good sharpness wise at 135mm). Extreme edges and corners improve stopping down the lens (this is quite different from the review I read and an important area)So overall quite a surprise as I often expect superzoom lenses to be compromised in many areas. This has some (distortion being the most obvious at the wide end), but a lot less than a full range superzoom (they tend to have very weak focal lenghts and can have poor central sharpness in some ranges)The Sony lens is a bit of an unexpected delight, and compared to the normal 18-55mm this is clearly a much better lens at all focal lenghts. Contrast and micro contrast are verging on some of the best I've seen on a lens (really that good) I have had the benefit of using some similar lenses from other makers. I tried the Pentax 18-135mm WR lens, that's WR which is great but I have to be blunt here, the Sony completely destroys it's Pentax rival in every regard, sharpness, CA (quite bad on the Pentax) and that lens has poor performance not very sharp in the middle and very weak tele end even fully stopped down. The Sony is by comparison stunningly sharp and a vastly superior lens that's in a different league.The Nikkor 18-105mm is a lens I quite liked it's a pretty sharp lens across the range and it holds slightly faster apertures than the Sony at equivalent focal lengths, but has more distortion and pincushion, more CA, and though probably a bit more consistent on the edges it can't match the Sony's quite excellent central sharpness. The rattle prone hood, and plastic mount and cheaper build let the show down.For reference the apertures are approx as below at the focal lengths:18-20mm f3.520-30mm f430-45mm f4.550-60mm f5Over 60mm f5.6In conclusion bar some minor niggles, really only a better very quiet SAM motor would make it hit the 5 star rating. As it stands right now I'm impressed (least with this sample) Sony got right what Nikon and Pentax got wrong. Nikon had some good optics let down with cheap build and a nasty plastic mount, Pentax had a decent build lens, with crushingly mediocre optics. Here we have good optics, with good build and a fair price it's a winner in my view.Of course this isn't going to replace a faster lens, but an all in one ""handy"" range this deliver and it does it very well for the price. If you're tempted to give it a bash in a kit bundle, you're in for a treat. Even at around £250 odd, this is a pretty fair price. Well worth investigating and a very decent worthy lens. I've seen this go for a £100 on top of an A65 bundle v the 18-55mm SAM, you would really be missing out if you passed a deal like that up. I would have no hesitation using this even for important photos such as group shots and general purpose shots, it's useful range makes it ideal as a travel lens (add a fast prime and you have a 2 lens solution for general and low light)Update 11/2013:Lens is working fine, but dig around for the best prices on this lens, I think a Tamron 17-50mm would be a better first bet (I have both myself- they are quite different lenses for obvious reasons one has the range but is slower, the Tamron has a shorter reach but a bit wider and f2.8 is faster). It's still worth adding this lens at some point or when the price drops a bit, or looking out for a deal/bundle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJUT0Z3PW4N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00836H3Z8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJUT0Z3PW4N9","A3ELA14YZQ0NE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ELA14YZQ0NE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book, recently reissued by Apocryphile Press, is one of the more heavily sought-after volumes on Old Catholicism on various online venues, used bookstores, and other avenues. Part of the reason for this is simple - Old Catholicism as a denomination and phenomenon in the Christian tradition is relatively little studied, and much of the material is done in German and other continental European languages. There are no major established seminaries, no strong denominational resources, and, particularly in the English-speaking world, a lot of competing sources of material that rarely approaches the quality of being good scholarship. C.B. Moss has produced a reasonably sound, reasonably broad account of European Old Catholicism in historical, ecclesial, and to lesser extent theological, terms.Moss' first inspiration to study the phenomenon of Old Catholicism came from a foundational book of my own in this regard, the text 'History of the So-Called Jansenist Church of Holland'. This book, published in the 1850s, describes some of the earliest issues that led to a separate but Catholic church in Holland; this group later formed relationships with other continental Europeans, primarily but not exclusively in the German lands, after Vatican I. Moss' survey of church history from the Conciliar Movement (circa fourteenth century) to the first Vatican Council takes up more than half the book; this history is interesting and worthwhile, and serves as a good guide to process for Anglican thinking of the time as well as Old Catholic.It is after this point in the text that the work of history of Old Catholicism proper really takes place. Moss looks at the various national/cultural situations in turn - German, Swiss, Latin, etc. He spends a good amount of time on the Reunion conferences at Bonn and the Declaration of Utrecht, and various conferences that have taken place since Vatican I in which the administrative side of Old Catholicism has been formed. Moss also devotes a chapter to Old Catholic liturgy, as well as one to ecumenical relationships with other Christians - both of these could be better if more fully developed. Moss concentrates the native language liturgies and is generally dismissive of the English versions of Old Catholic liturgical resources.Of course, C.B. Moss was a cleric of the Church of England. While making a claim to present an unbiased and objective review of the material, he nonetheless betrays himself at the outset by labeling the foundational figures of North American Old Catholic jurisdictions with the chapter title, 'False Starts', with the fully intended double entendre that that terminology implies. Even as Moss speaks in glowing words about the unity of intercommunion and understanding given by the Bonn Agreement and the way in which this models a better means of cooperation among Christian bodies, he is careful to exclude those he doesn't seem to think pass muster. The bias is subtle but very present, even in the less critical parts of the narrative. (Moss in other writing confesses his personal bias against the North American and British expressions of Old Catholicism.)The version of this text reissued and revised in 1977 devotes a special addendum to the Old Catholic body since Vatican II. Moss highlights certain restricted communion-agreement sharings that are significant; he also highlights other communion issues with Lutherans, Orthodox, and other churches, including the Anglican communion since the advent of women's ordination. This has continued to be a problem area for the Old Catholics.This is a flawed text in many ways, but still remains a touchstone for Old Catholic history if for no other reason it is one of the few with a scholarly authority. It is a must for any in Old Catholic and Independent Anglican churches, to help them better understand their own history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTF2ZVPD051QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GIX0E8#wasThisHelpful","RTF2ZVPD051QS","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Romer's Testament: The Bible and History is an accessible, interesting account of both the Bible in history, and the history of the development of the sacred text. Romer explores various issues according to the timeline of events, incorporating issues of archaeology, textual redaction, philosophy and sociology into the discussion.'Romer does not say things like this to discredit or discount the biblical testimony; far from it, Romer is probably more sympathetic to the idea of divine inspiration than many modern scripture scholars. But he is careful to distinguish interpretation from text, historical development from poetical extension, and let both the historical record and the biblical texts speak for themselves, sometimes in harmony and sometimes in discord.Romer's recounting of the original writing and compilation of the Hebrew scriptures is very interesting. The original need for a 'bible' arose in the face of repeated destructions, exiles, and, particularly, the destruction of the Temple, twice. 'The vice-like pressure of these two national disasters forced into being the Hebrew Bible, which is also the Christian Old Testament. But these disasters also affected the very identity of the God that the ancient books defined. For ancient gods changed when they were uprooted. These gods, with their cults and rituals, were bound into the life and character of the cities and civilisations in which they were first worshipped.'The Bible became a way for the preservation of this way of life and worship, and in the end provided the primary means for the preservation of the identity of the people of Israel even when there was no geographic centre to call home.Romer's discussion of the closing of the canon and subsequent development of the Bible in the Christian world is fascinating, too. From discussions of the early church fathers, such as Jerome, to the political intrigues over the vernacular translations of the Bible in the early Renaissance, he provides interesting details. Speaking of Jerome (during a discussion of the Latin Vulgate): 'At once a saint and among the greatest doctors of the church, Jerome was yet a man of whom it has been said that he was canonised not for his qualities of saintliness, but for the services he rendered the Roman church. Hot-tempered, outspoken, passionately devoted to his work and his friends, Jerome is certainly one of the most extraordinary figures in church history. And doubtless, it is due to this special temperament that his Latin Bible has come to be regarded by many people almost as if it were the unmediated word of God himself.'Of course, many today (especially in America) see the King James Version of the Bible in much the same light. To ignore the background to the development of this Bible does it a disservice; yet, to discount the true inspiration that is apparent on the pages of the King James Version is also to do it a disservice.From the Israel stela of Thebes to the motion pictures of Cecil B. DeMille, this book covers the large expanse of history humour and graceful prose, without getting bogged down in minute points. There is plenty to argue with in this book, but then, of which book on this theme is there not?","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTABHHGJD5PPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0948397128#wasThisHelpful","RTABHHGJD5PPO","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Timothy Clark's text on Martin Heidegger is part of a recent series put out by the Routledge Press, designed under the general editorial direction of Robert Eaglestone (Royal Holloway, University of London), to explore the most recent and exciting ideas in intellectual development during the past century or so. To this end, figures such as Paul Ricouer, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and other influential thinkers in critical thought are highlighted in the series, planned to include more than 21 volumes in all.Clark's text, following the pattern of the others, includes background information on Heidegger and its significance, the key ideas and sources, and Heidegger's continuing impact on other thinkers. As the series preface indicates, no critical thinker arises in a vacuum, so the context, influences and broader cultural environment are all important as a part of the study, something with which Heidegger might agree, although many of the thinkers in this series are also influenced greatly by the productionist metaphysics against which Heidegger spent much time and energy.Why is Heidegger included in this series? This series is primary for critical thinking in a literary sense, and Heidegger is no literary theorist or critic per se. In fact, this is the first volume to deal primary and exclusively with this line of thinking in Heidegger. However, Heidegger's influence extended far beyond what is more traditionally considered his confines of philosophy, primarily the philosophy of metaphysics, with questions of ontology. Heidegger, by influencing some of the key thinkers in the field of literary criticism, has had a knock-on effect far exceeding his actual contributions to the subject. Intellectual `workers in the field' such as Herbert Marcuse, Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, and perhaps most importantly Jacques Derrida derive much in response to and reaction to Heidegger, whose influence extends into psychology, history, politics, linguistics, literary analysis, philosophy, science, and theology (and even further afield).One of the useful features of the text is the side-bar boxes inserted at various points. For example, during the discussion on Heidegger's development of Geschichte (deep history), there are brief discussions, set apart from the primary strand of the text, on Nihilism and Explanation, developing further these ideas should the reader not be familiar with them, or at least not in the way with which Heidegger would be working with ideas derived from them. Each section on a key idea spans twenty to thirty pages, with a two-page summary concluding each, which gives a recap of the ideas (and provides a handy reference).My first interest in Heidegger developed out of an interest in the philosophical underpinnings of politics and theology, but this volume looking at his interest in art, literature and the general mindset and development of Western culture certainly adds new dimension to the author of `Being and Time' (yet interestingly, the primary translation of `Being and Time' for English audiences is probably that done by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson - Macquarrie being an important Anglican theologian I study). To a certain extent, this kind of volume on literary analysis violates certain ideas of Heidegger that would resist the application of productionist theories to works of art. Heidegger is probably the father of postmodernism in many respects, something that might make him uncomfortable should postmodernism slip into being yet one more school in the line of Western philosophical and intellectual development.Clark's primary text from Heidegger for this study is not `Being and Time' as much as it is Heidegger's lecture `The Origin of the Work of Art', delivered in the 1930s and published in 1950. Heidegger applies his principles of philosophical analysis to poetry, painting, architecture and other creative enterprises. Heidegger longed for a complete break with what he saw as the single strand of Western development from the time of the Greek philosophers to the present that culminates in the death of art and the nihilistic tendencies of the modern technological world.Clark deals with Heidegger's flirtation with the Nazi party in a frank and clear way. That Heidegger was a dues-paying member of the National Socialist party is not a matter of dispute; that Heidegger was initially entranced by the Nazi idealism is likewise fairly well established, given his promotion of their ideals early in his rectorship at the university. However, Heidegger also became disenchanted with them very early in their tenure - by 1934 Heidegger was no longer a public voice in support of them. Why then did he continue paying dues to the party? One of the more bizarre elements of Heidegger's story is the intellectual devotion given to him by students, including Jewish students such as Arendt, Marcuse, Strauss, and others, and the level of influence he had on other Jewish intellectuals such as Derrida, given his Nazi flirtations.The concluding chapter, After Heidegger, highlights some key areas of development in relation to other thinkers, as well as points of possible exploration for the reader. Heidegger's thought vis-à-vis Derrida and Blanchot (particularly with regard to destruction/deconstruction), his thought with regard to Ricouer and Gadamer (especially his response to the idea of hermeneutics), and his ideas as they apply to the continuing development of philosophical and intellectual history, particularly in the areas of art and literature, and insure Heidegger remaining a relevant if controversial figure in intellectual development.As do the other volumes in this series, Clark concludes with an annotated bibliography of works by Heidegger, works on Heidegger, and a good index.While this series focuses intentionally upon literary theory, in fact this is only the starting point. For Heidegger (as for others in this series) the expanse is far too broad to be drawn into such narrow guidelines, and the important and impact of the ideas extends out into the whole range of intellectual development. As intellectual endeavours of every sort depend upon language, understanding, and interpretation, the thorough comprehension of how and why we know what we know is crucial.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMUXOWTFKF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008IU21VU#wasThisHelpful","ROMUXOWTFKF2","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" idea comes from World War II, when the British government sponsored placards and other notices with this message to try to keep both the spirits and the resolve of the people high in the midst of sometimes daily bombings. Most of us do not have endure that today, but there are enough causes of stress and consternation that a gentle reminder of the need to persevere, to just keep plodding through, can be useful.This particular incarnation of the meme is a large poster -- it will cover the better part of a dormitory door or bedroom door; it is great for college students (who often need to be reminded to carry on, if not keep calm!), but also for any one who might need a little reminder. This poster swaps the traditional red and white with a green background -- not quite House of Commons green, but close -- excellent for the anglophile, particularly those who like to watch Prime Minister's Question Time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235I4VXD696PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CM35P4#wasThisHelpful","R235I4VXD696PQ","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the back of my copy of Kitto's book, there is a quote from Raymond Mortimer declaring this volume to be the best introduction to Ancient Greece he had ever read. I'm not sure if I can go that far with regard to this book; perhaps in 1957, when it first came out, that accolade would have been appropriate. However, just because I can't declare this book to be the best unreservedly, I still consider it to be an excellent text, and one that I have very useful in my upper-level undergraduate course in Ancient Greek philosophy.Kitto has relatively short chapters on a host of subjects, including origins, culture, warfare, political life, philosophy, art, and more. These are arranged according to certain major facets of Greek life that we know - for example, Homer gets a chapter to himself. However, Homer neither arose in a vacuum nor did his work only matter during his (or her) time. Kitto doesn't address too much about the academic controversy over who Homer might have been, but rather addresses the work that we have which survives. That work includes an exploration of the direct and indirect influences on later generations of Greeks, who in turn have had profound impact on our own culture.Kitto spends a good deal of time on the political structure of Greek life, from the early settlement and migration times, to development of small polities, to larger hegemonic times and the Athenian empire, brief-lived though it was. One question I ask my class to address out of Kitto's text is this - Sparta seems to have won the war, but Athens won the peace; what does this mean? Kitto gives a lot of insight into the competition between Athens and Sparta, and to a lesser extent other polities around the Aegean and off toward Italy; there were unified times in the face of Persian aggression, but more often there were less organized times, which allowed for a kind of international relations in microcosmic form. I once had a professor who longed to teach a modern international relations course using nothing but Herodotus and Thucydides - one reading Kitto can get the sense that there are many truths in this desire, given that many of the motivations of nations and many of the principles of politics among nations remain the same as can be found in the speeches recounted in Thucydides' writing.Kitto clearly has a deep love of the ancient Greek culture, and parallels much of his own time with this period; he is also quick to point out the differences. This is perhaps the one weakness of this text. If one lacks a familiarity with Britain and British sensibilities and learning in the first half of the twentieth century, one may lose some of the references Kitto makes - for example, he makes reference to the Sophists as being akin to those who might host a seminar, `Did You Want to be a 1000GBP Man?' - the answer would be a resounding no today; he also alludes to `our political parties' which are clearly different from those today (and for those in North America, one might have really no hook upon which to hang understanding).On the other hand, some things haven't changed. He also says of the Sophists that `Perhaps ""Professor"" would be a rough modern equivalent to ""Sophist"".' A challenge to remember, indeed! This is certainly something my students can understand. He also uses colourful stories such as Diogenes calling to both the perfumed set and what would be the Greek grunge set, `Affectation!' He also pulls from Herodotus the disappointment of Croesus at finding out that Tellus, Cleopas and Biton led happier lives than he (but alas, that they were dead, too...). There are many pieces that stick with one upon reading, and because this text does not go overboard in information, it fits together in a more easily grasped framework, too.One might challenge Kitto's assertion that the Greeks were as superior as they are presented - `unless our standards of civilization are comfort and contraptions, Athens from (say) 480 to 380 was clearly the most civilized society that has yet existed.' However, there is no doubt that the Greeks advanced in directions hitherto unknown and rarely exceeded in a measure-by-measure analysis. This comes through with Kitto - a worthy text for a worthy subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GX28K3JC3KMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072VM2VK#wasThisHelpful","R3GX28K3JC3KMH","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an absolutely glorious wine, but as my friend and I agreed, really should be held back for half a decade more at least (and perhaps a few decades) to let it mature.  Unfortunately, most restaurants can no longer afford to lay up wines for a long period of time - many risk going out of business before the wine reaches optimum age.This wine opened up beautifully after a just a few minutes.  A bit of smokiness and a bit of flower in the bouquet, no acidity in the taste with good grape and currant tones, and a wonderful purple colour all combined to make this a real experience.  This wine is four-fifths Cabernet and one-fifth Merlot, so it has strong body without being overpowering.If you get the chance, don't pass!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA5FL5YJNITPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009G7CDWG#wasThisHelpful","RA5FL5YJNITPW","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is surprising to me how many people assume that `On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century.  Published in 1859, `On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind `On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death.  F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection.  Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz).  It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology.  A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as `improved Adam Smith' and `popularised Ricardo'.  Perhaps it is in part the brevity of `On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text.  The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically.  He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society.  He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism.  Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system.  All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is `Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'.  Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here.  Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power.  This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs.  The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity.  It is still wrong.  Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, `Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'.  It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate.  Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.).  Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, `No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.'  He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech.  Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, `Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications.  Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community.  Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large.  Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where `thought police' are feared, and `political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAJBPHU3VDTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613823738#wasThisHelpful","R3BAJBPHU3VDTK","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past decade, I have taught the Intro. to Political Science (201) course several times at my local community college - despite the name of the course, it is often the second course students take, after the Intro. to American Government (101) course.  I look forward to teaching it again, perhaps in this coming year.  I have always used an edition of Danziger's text, and this latest incarnation will continue to be my choice.This book introduces the basic elements of political philosophy, political theory, political parties, world politics and international relations, and political institutions.  The first chapter sets the stage for the study of political science as a field of inquiry, helping to determine what is and is not an appropriately political question (as opposed to a psychological question, or an historical question, etc.).  Obviously there will be overlap in disciplines, but this chapter does a good job at setting out some basic elements in what we know and how we know it with regard to politics.The book then proceeds to discuss the topic in four major headings:  political behaviour, political systems, political processes, and politics among states.  For my purposes, I start with the later sections of world politics and work back - I find that students relate to the theories better after we've discussed particulars; this book is good at bringing up important elements and parallels across national lines, political parties, and cultural norms.  This latest edition includes updated information on the Iraqi processes toward democracy, Chilean situations with the Mapuche people, Ireland's shift from economic dynamo to struggling economy, and the changing face of both China and the European Union in the modern world.  To this extent, I'm working backwards from the way the book is organized, but each chapter does work as a self-contained set of data.The book is generously supplied with graphics, images, charts and figures, as well as sidebar and boxed information that adds anecdotes, debates and useful discussion points and questions for further thought.Ultimately, as Danziger states, `The study of the political world is of crucial importance to the creation of humane social life.  Ultimately it is up to you, as you read this book, to decide what can be known about politics and whether you think political ""science"" is feasible.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BI25RB6X44FK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0205854923#wasThisHelpful","R1BI25RB6X44FK","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like another reviewer, I too use this book as part of an undergraduate course on Modern and Contemporary Judaism, which I teach primarily for military personnel as part of their distance education undergraduate degrees. I include a few other books in the syllabus, but this book is often one of the ones most frequently cited as helpful due to its question-and-answer format. When I was studying for a Jewish Studies certificate at Indiana University some time ago (nearing a quarter of a century ago), an earlier version of this book was one of my regular references for a quick and informative answer to questions as they arose. The more recent edition, revised carefully and thoroughly by Rabbi Lawrence Hoffman, preserves the style and utility of Rabbi Morris Kertzer's base text while adding material both for extension of questions and updating of information.The book is broken into nine major sections, each one presenting within a series of questions. The first section looks at the different kinds of Judaism - Reform, Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, etc., and some other issues that come up with regard to basic identity - what is a Zionist? How does the Jewish community relate to the wider community?The next few sections look specifically at religious questions, in terms of Bible and history, ritual and practice, and basic belief structures. Rabbis Kertzer and Hoffman address the differences in beliefs and practices largely for a Christian readership or for the Jewish person raised in a predominantly Christian culture.Other sections include ideas of home and homeland, calendar issues (what is Chanukah and why does it fall at different times of year? etc.), and Jewish views on various issues in shared society such as divorce, children, and other topics.The book also includes a useful glossary. `Like members of any culture, Jews describe what matters to them using a specialized vocabulary.' Throughout the book, specialised words are provided with pronunciation keys (although there are a few sounds in Hebrew that are difficult to transliterate into English). In addition to the glossary, there is a very handy index, so that if the particular question needing to be answered cannot be found easily in the table of contents, the topic should be able to be found in the index.This book is very useful for anyone who is looking for basic answers and insights into Judaism in its different aspects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NRMTTCPJ991Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1258326035#wasThisHelpful","R1NRMTTCPJ991Y","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this book would imply that it is not a book for me.  The first time I read the New Testament was when I was eight years old - I think I understood about ten percent of what I was reading, and that was on the surface level.  But I did read it.  Since then, I've read it multiple times, including out loud, in Latin, in Greek, and for intensive classes at the graduate level.  So, naturally, there's nothing in this book for me, right?Wrong.I am chaplain in a retirement community where the average age is over 80 - this is perhaps the last American generation where most people grew up with a regular knowledge of the Bible, and yet even in this group, as we go through our Bible studies, many confess at one point or another that what we've covered is new, or different, or in some way a challenge.  As a perhaps overeducated person in this field, one of my tendencies is to go for the technical, the intensive, the deep, when perhaps the question is as simple as saying someone's name again.  (As an aside, I had one man who once was complimenting my abilities to another, at how wonderful my Bible study sessions were; just as I was tempted toward pride, he then announced, `Yes, he can pronounce all those names!'  So much for theology, literary analysis, and the like...)Ron Allen referenced Dragnet in the introduction, in that he intentionally presents a `just the fact, ma'am' approach, and writes in a deliberately informal (and hence accessible) style.  He gives historical background for the book and the people in the book. Understanding the world of Judaism and the world of antiquity helps the reader to put the New Testament in perspective - this was not originally a book written in King James English or in an Elizabethan setting, after all.  He then gives two brief overviews of the New Testament, one chronological based on events contained in the narratives, and one chronological based on the authorship of the books (this latter is a bit more fuzzy in that there is greater debate on the order of several of the books, but Allen places them in their brief context here).His succeeding chapters then give overviews of the life of Jesus, the time after Jesus but before Paul, the Pauline mission and letters, the Gospels (which is in fact a later set of writings than many pieces from Paul), and then later writings.  One particularly interesting chapter is the one on famous passages from the New Testament - the `Love Chapter' of Corinthians, John 3:16, the Golden Rule, etc.  Allen sets these in context as well as discusses the way they have been used (and potentially misused), and warns against prooftexting, the idea of dueling Bible verses to try to prove a point.Allen's appendices give the reader guidance for further study, for ways in which to read the New Testament, and a brief discussion on terminology.  On the whole, this is a good book, even for the more advanced scholar, who will be reminded of some basic truths and approaches useful for those outside the academic realm, but particularly for those who are looking for a gentle introduction without too much jargon or assumption of set theological or educational background.  A willing spirit and open heart will find something useful here.My one wish would be for an index.  Apart from that, Allen's own writing at the end is useful instruction:  `While we wait for final and complete knowledge, we should keep in mind that representatives from each end of the spectrum of interpretation all agree that God is love.  The nature of God should determine what happens in the church.  We should love one another.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2568CN8YK9XAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802867359#wasThisHelpful","R2568CN8YK9XAQ","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use the book `Readings in Epistemology' by Fr. Vincent Potter (late of Fordham University) in the Epistemology (400-level course) I teach.  Most of my students have had prior to the course on the most basic introduction to epistemological ideas; in the introductory course, they will have studied Descartes and Locke - although for Locke, they likely concentrated more on the Two Treatises on Civil Government rather than the epistemological writings.The book includes in chronological arrangement excerpts from the following:  Francis Bacon, Galileo, Rene Descartes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.  There is an appendix with some passages from Thomas Aquinas, and I usually have my students in the first week read these things first.  As one can see, the pieces are heavily weighted toward the Empiricism side of things; also, ending with Kant, we certainly lose anything twentieth century on linguistic, philosophy of mind or other issues that have arisen to make Epistemology a key philosophical area of discussion.  However, much of that gets so technical so fast that, for an introductory course in the subject, primary texts would be difficult for many students.Potter's idea is to give a reading list that helps demonstrate `in a general way what the nature and scope of man's capacity to know are.'  How do ideas come into play?  What role do our senses have in giving us knowledge?  Can we count on these?  To what degree?  How do we judge things true or false?Potter gives a brief historical context for the book as a whole, and then a short essay for each of the philosophers presented.  These essays serve to connect the thinkers to each other as well as others beyond the scope of the book (particularly strands of Plato and Aristotle that wind through the thinking).  There are also study questions at the end of set of readings.  These are open-ended questions that can serve students who are searching for the right angle for research papers and final essays.This is a good basic collection of readings for an undergraduate introduction to the subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VH8RQ63YY1BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0823214923#wasThisHelpful","R1VH8RQ63YY1BU","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"- The Good -Bob Hechlenski has produced a very personal account with many interesting tidbits about small craft aviation - what it is like to have your own plane.  Did you ever wonder why major airports don't have lots of small planes jetting around?  Hechlinski tells you.  Did you know that not all airports have paved runways?  How is it to land a plane on a strip of grass that may have groundhog holes (a la `Caddyshack' minus the Bill Murray)?  Just how many airports are there, anyway?  Hechlinski takes you on a little experienced tour of a unique part of American byways.  He also includes his own life and experiences, as well as the reasons why he gave up flying, in a touching manner.- The Bad -The book is advertised as one where you can open it at any point and read, because the stories aren't told in a way that requires one to flow into the other.  This is not always a good point - details might be missed from prior stories.  This is particularly apparent when geography gets in the way; Beliot has the world's prettiest airport, according to Hechlinski (and their own marketing material), but it took me a while to figure out where this was, since the state name isn't clearly identified.- The Ugly -Being a self-published text, this suffers from the same problems as most self-published texts.  There are typos and grammar errors on most every page.  Also, the book uses lots of jargon and acronyms that are not commonplace to people outside the flying field.  Better editing both for style and mechanics would be helpful should this have another edition.On the whole, this is a book that has much to recommend it, and some things that will make reading it a bumpy ride.

"I reviewed another commentary on Job written by Gerry Janzen, and in that review I mentioned that Janzen told me in conversation an interesting idea - that one might do a lot of research on something, and then throw away all the notes, and begin again.  Janzen has to some extent been doing that with Job for much of his life - Job has been a special interest, a special (perhaps sacred) study, and this latest commentary has a particular meaning for him.In the period between writing the basic manuscript here and its publication, Janzen was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and recounts part of what he went through, with reflection upon Job, as part of the epilogue.  He includes his struggle to find meaning and connection in Teilhard and Job, as well as his work to craft in the midst of this a funeral homily for another person dying of cancer, who nonetheless had been an inspiration to him.The story of Job is basically a familiar one - bad things happen to good people.  How and why becomes a perennial question for humanity.  The answer in Job, depending upon one's interpretation, is not always satisfying.  Job has ""a primal trust in the God who gave and gives him breath.""  Thus, Job can maintain his innocence and at the same time trust in God's judgement.  However, as Janzen states, when we have God as both the accuser and the judge, the courtroom image that so often is used as a paradigm for Job breaks down, at least for the typical modern Westerner, accustomed to at least the idea if not the reality of an unbiased adjudication.  There is a deeper connection between God and Job, one that permits the element of the law and logic on the surface, but one that also connects the two (and, by extension, all the rest of us as God's creation) that puts us in a family relation.Janzen argues that there are two strands of relationship here - one is the political, and one is the familial.  Both have communal aspects to them, and both serve different needs and purposes.  It is the familial, however, that Job finds his greatest comfort. Job has friends who arrive, but their comfort is flawed - they are in fact better as being of aid to Job before they start talking, when they are present in silence, than when they begin to expand theologically upon why this might be happening to Job.  Even God's own theological pronouncements fall short of giving the whole story to Job, who knows through his deeper connection, his whole physical being as connected to God and creation.  The God of the whirlwind brings the scent of the water from the sea into the barren, dry land that renews more than any words could do, and sustains even in the event of difficult pronouncements.God comes in many ways.  Sometimes, blueberries.  Sometimes, tufts of flowers.  Janzen recounts near the end the tale of the man who is the sole surviving member of his family from the Holocaust.  He marries a woman who similarly is the sole survivor of her family.  He lives what in a typical Western sense would be considered happy and successful, building a professional life and happy family life.  ""Dare anyone speak of his life as enjoying a Hollywood ending?"" Janzen asks.  I am reminded here of the end of the film of Schindler's List, where the survivors and family members dramatically (in Hollywood form, now in colour, whereas the rest of the film was in black and white) present a picture of hope, that can be easily deceptive - remember that Schindler's list had hundreds, whereas Hitler's list had millions who did not make it.  And yet both of these allow us to see the ending of Job with a new context.  ""If, despite all that has happened, life can resume itself and go on, and even, now and then, give rise to singing, it is to be embraced, though from now on life is even more unfathomable than Job and his friends could previously have imagined.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZHMQRZG7B02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080284829X#wasThisHelpful","R1KZHMQRZG7B02","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reinhardt Grossmann wrote, 'If existence did not exist, then nothing would exist.' While this may sound like common sense, in the world of ontology and metaphysics, it is not as simple as one might think. This logical proposition, according to Grossmann, works whether one sees existence as a property or attribute, or as the 'ultimate substratum' (this phrase always reminded me of Tillich's 'ground of being' idea). This idea of Grossmann's comes at the end of the book, in the final section 'About the Nature of Existence'.Grossmann was my first metaphysics professor, and I had a course with him the year he was putting the finishing touches on this book with the publisher. The course followed the book fairly closely, so I had the benefit both of reading the text as well as hearing Grossmann's lectures on the subject.The first part of the book is introductory, setting the stage by exploring the nature of ontology and being, the debates between realism vs. idealism (in favour of realism), and a defense of empiricism. While Platonism serves as the root of rationalism, Grossmann's empiricism doesn't allow for universals that are unexemplified -- while he admits that he cannot prove that there are no unexemplified universals, he also states that the case in favour of such is unconvincing.The heart of the book is the section section, on Categories. (This section is 340 of the book's 420 pages.) This Grossmann sees as a contemporary update and continuation of Aristotelian categories. Individuals as entities, properties and their natures, relations, classes, wholes, numbers, and facts are the primary divisions here. Not only does Grossmann explain the metaphysical use of such terms and topics, but also he surveys the field of ontology over the past few generations. Bradley, Russell, Frege, Brentano, Cantor, Husserl and Wittgenstein are just a few of the names drawn into the study.The final section argues strongly about the nature of existence, that it is not just an 'empty sound' applied, but that existence is not merely a property or attribute, either. Even so, 'existence' has an undefinable side; also, there are objects of thought that do not exist, and fictional characters do not exist, according to Grossmann's structure.This is an interesting path through metaphysics and ontology, a subject that once held centre-stage in philosophy, but is now a little off the stage in favour of other topics. Metaphysics remains a valuable study, and Grossmann's work is a good survey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOBK0714NI6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004II9IAI#wasThisHelpful","R3SOBK0714NI6Q","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cleary is one of the foremost scholars of ancient Chinese and Japanese. Mostly likely, if you have read a copy of ancient Chinese classic 'The Art of War' (a text widely popular, from historians and military strategists to corporate raiders and managers), it has been one of Cleary's translations.Following the success of the book on the Tao, Cleary turned to another pillar of ancient Chinese thought, and developed this further volume in the 'Essentials' series, The Essential Confucius, the heart of Confucius' teachings in authentic I Ching order.Confucius is a confusing character to classify. He does not fit the characterisation of the typical religious leader. He certainly did not mean to found a religion. Confucius was an educator, a social critic, a politician, and philosopher.'""The Analects of Confucius"" are a basic source for a wide range of advice on human affairs--from governing nations and managing enterprises to dealing with society and getting along with others.'Confucius is much more than the author of fortune-cookie proverbs. In this work, Cleary has set forth the sayings of Confucius in the order of the sixty-four classic I Ching hexagrams. Many of these sayings are reduced (and likewise dismissed) as fortune-cookie sayings; however, taken together with the commentaries of Confucius, these give profound insight into the human condition. The I Ching, or literally, Book of Change, is a book which Confucius studied and promoted. Thus, to use it as a guide to Confucius' own writings is appropriate and authentic.Confucius tried to stimulate people into original thinking, into independent thinking. It is ironic that so many times in history that original thinking has been suppressed in favour of Confucian purity -- a perennial danger in any religion.An example of Cleary's technique is in order:Book of ChangeGood people examine themselves and cultivate virtue- Confucius said, 'Study as though you will not reach, as if you may lose it.' (8:17)- Confucius said, 'The virtue of balanced normalcy is consummate, it seems, but it has been scarce among the people for a long time.' (6:29)Cleary presents the I Ching, the setting of Confucius proverb, and then various commentaries upon it. Through the sixty-four sayings and commentaries, one gets a sense of exegesis similar in character to Mishnah and Talmud as well as various Christian commentators.Confucius above all believed in the responsibility of the learned to the ignorant, the powerful to the weak, and the wealthy for the poor. Each individual is entrusted with potential to serve the greater good of all, not just himself or herself. These are words that are worthy hearing and elevating, and not dismissing as after-dinner quips.May your reading be truly enlightened in the virtues of humanity, justice, courtesy and wisdom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R88K7U1M5L15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062501577#wasThisHelpful","R3R88K7U1M5L15","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a fan of Kathleen Norris since I read ""Cloister Walk"" many years ago.  When I first discovered Norris, I was contemplating my own monastic vocation (which never came) and a call to seminary (which did come).  One of the things that makes this text significant for me is that, at various points in my relationship with the church, the seminary, and ministry beyond, I have had times of profound depression, as well as periods where it was force of habit more than anything else that kept me going forward.  She describes acedia, a kind of depression-apathy state of being, as akin to a medieval demonic possession.  Using insights from earlier texts, primarily of those in and about monastic life, she looks for hope in the midst of the darkness.Norris had a routine, a rather successful routine, of writing and interpreting things related to monastic life and spirituality, but this came to a breaking point after her husband, who had been a constant presence (literarily in the background but very much present for Norris), died in 2003.  Choosing to let go and give up much of her routine seemed like an attractive option, but then, there's also the tendency to wallow and let the darker aspects of that creep in.  This book in some ways is like a personal therapy for Norris, seeking to work through some of the emotions and doldrums as she pushes past the lethargy that can come from an overload of emotions.This fits me at different times in my life, and is a book I know I shall return to again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLANAXUEER2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594489963#wasThisHelpful","RFLANAXUEER2N","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, I recall a friend of mine talking about his daughter staring out of the car window as they drove along.  It was a dark and dreary day, one of those gray days that are generally uninspiring.  My friend asked his daughter what she was thinking, trying to pass the time.  ""I'm just looking at all the different shades of gray,"" she said.  Art is all around us if we're open to it.This book, ""Found Art,"" by Leeana Miller Tankersley, is a book that opens one to this kind of possibility.  Tankersley frames how she found things in her life in unexpected ways by talking about her relationship with her husband, who, being in the military, had her follow to places she never thought she would go.  What does one find in such places?  Going to Bahrain, will one find endless shades of brown from the desert, or will one find something more remarkable?Tankersley describes her surroundings, her feelings, and her relationship both with her husband and with God (she is a graduate of Liberty University, founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell).  She finds an interesting connection, for a Christian, in the regular call to prayer in the Muslim society.This is not a book about art per se as much as it is a reflection on the art of living, and being aware of what is around us.  And in that, the author does a very good job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FO4FR7RA0TPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031029133X#wasThisHelpful","R3FO4FR7RA0TPZ","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is one of the most interesting political autobiographies I have read (and I've read many of them). I must confess that interest was intensified due to the fact that I worked in the House of Commons during her tenure in office, and indeed worked during the 1987 General Election for two Conservative Members of Parliament (David Amess of Basildon and David Evennett of Erith & Crayford--yes, I know, you've never heard of either of them).This is actually the first volume of Margaret Thatcher's books to be published; the prequel is 'The Path to Power' and there is a follow-up, 'The Collected Speeches', but for those interested, 'The Downing Street Years' is the book to have.It begins with the 1979 General Election, and carries forward to her resignation as Prime Minister a decade later. In this volume are her perspectives on all the various Cabinet intrigues, shuffles and reshuffles; her attempts to find civil servants and other helpers who were not of the old guard but of a new mentality, often asking, 'Is he one of us?' by which she meant, not is he a Conservative, but rather, will he get something accomplished, is he a do-er?Thatcher's perspectives on the various scandals and inter-Cabinet fighting makes for interesting reading -- she is candid in her likes and dislikes among her Cabinet colleagues. Her final row with Geoffrey Howe, who delivered a scathing speech in the HoC that mostly prompted the leadership crisis, is enlightening. (I've not seen his version, if one exists--it would be good to compare the two sides.) She was very disappointed at the end when she thought she had the continued support of the party, but each of her ministers and 'friends' told her in turn that while he supported her, others would not. She saw the writing on the wall, and after having won the first ballot for party leadership but not by a sufficient majority to avoid a second ballot, she resigned in favour of John Major (whose autobiography, recently issued, is also well worth reading, particularly for his comments about how Thatcher tried to maintain a controlling influence over him from behind the office).You might be tempted, if you're not really into politics and not reading this for scholarly purposes, to skim over various minor issues that are gone into great detail. Historians are appreciative, but I seriously ask myself how many non-political scientists and historians will read through all the detail of what are now minor bits of history?In all, a brilliant career, the first woman head of government in a major Western democracy, and well worth reading on the whole.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KDJIE7V4CO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007456638#wasThisHelpful","R31KDJIE7V4CO2","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"David Hume was perhaps the leading light in the Empiricist movement in philosophy. Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge. Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'. Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this. However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient. Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology. Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism). For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding. According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding. In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosophers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).This is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions. As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a great text with which to start.  The Cambridge editions are generally consistently good in terms of accuracy of the edition.  I have many in my library, and have not been disappointed yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90Q43D61DXDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521604036#wasThisHelpful","R90Q43D61DXDW","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was never meant to be high art, or a blockbuster.  To judge it against such standards would be to apply the same kind of aesthetic judgment one uses with regard to Da Vinci or Monet to assess my elementary grade sponge-and-watercolour paintings.  For what they are, my paintings were okay -- they even won the occasional award.  But here I sit, no master artist.In looking into this film, I was introduced for the first time to a word - mockbuster.  I knew that Hollywood frequently had similar projects going on; the films 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact' could not have been planned and produced without knowledge of each other, for example.  But a mockbuster is a different animal - it is a film designed deliberately to ride the coat-tails of a larger production; in this case, Marvel's 'Thor', the big-budget blockbuster, was planned for a Spring 2011 release.  Enter Asylum, a production company that specialises in such enterprises.'Almighty Thor' premiered on SyFy about the same time as Marvel's 'Thor' appeared in the cinema.  There's really no mistaking the two.  Both start with the premise of the Norse legends, and draw from the character sets, but both go from there in different directions.  'Almighty Thor' went down the road less expensive.  Perhaps the biggest name in the production was Richard Grieco, as the demonic deity Loki, who has every intention of wreaking havoc with as little expense as possible.  Other names of note include Kevin Nash as Odin, Jess Allen as his non-titular son Baldir, and Patricia Velasquez as Jarnsaxa, because every Nordic female character will have a Hispanic accent.  Perhaps that comes from living in Los Angeles in the modern times.  Yes, you heard that right - Thor battles Loki, with the help of Jarnsaxa, in the back alleys and by-ways (wherever location charges were cheap or non-existent) of the greater LA region.The plot isn't great - Odin and Baldir get killed (yes, you read that right - the immortals get killed) and Thor, who isn't yet prepared for fighting, has to avenge their deaths.  He challenges Loki in different ways, who usually has the upper hand until the end (spoiler alert! sorry if that spoils it for you).  But who is Thor?  Well, he certainly looks the part -- Cody Deal, a midwestern bodybuilder/model type turned Las Vegas/southern California dreamer, dreaming of an acting career.  You know he's buff, as he was real-life Caesar's Palace centurion, and there's no room for soft-focus or long-range lensing in real life.  But I am reminded here of the late Richard Burton, who described his body of work as consisting of a few good things, but primarily films which blessedly had faded from memory.  I suspect this might be one of the later for Deal, if he goes on to make better films; if not, well...  Deal talked of needing money for acting lessons; it is a good sign at least that he recognises the need for them.  Rumor has it there were those willing to front the needed money for them, but things do fall apart and fail to follow through.Principal photography for a film will often take months; this was done in less than two weeks.  Editing often also takes months; this was again done in a matter of a few weeks.  The CGI was rather amateurish - this can often be among the more expensive and time-consuming aspects of film, and time and money were not available.  Some of the screen shots and transitions reminded me of 'Plan 9' in that they didn't always seem to fit together.  Remarkably, Alan Smithee did not direct this, but I'm not entirely sure if anyone did -- nonetheless, Christopher Ray gets the credit here, whose other directing credits include fare such as 'Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus' and 'Reptisaurus'.  But then, checking the IMDb listing, it appears Ray was born to this kind of production, having played Christopher the baby in 'The Brain Leeches' before he was one year old.I can't say I liked the film, but I didn't despise it, either.  When I saw it on SyFy, it was paired with another Thor-related film (starring Zachery Ty Bryan of 'Home Improvement' fame) called 'Hammer of the Gods', another less-than-epic rendering of a tangentially-related story.  It will not surprise me when the awards shows overlook this production.  It wouldn't surprise me to see this repeated occasionally on SyFy, and among the fans and friends of those involved in the production, a reasonable DVD business.So, I can't really recommend this film, even though there was a time prior to seeing it that I wanted to (truth in advertising here, I was in contact, however limited, with someone on the production and had hoped for success for his sake, but then, as I stated above, things do fall apart and fail to follow through).  But I won't pound it into potshards with an almighty hammer, either.  It is what it is.  Remember the word 'mockbuster' as you watch it, and things might come together.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBALAAFC0WGQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZK5QIC#wasThisHelpful","RBALAAFC0WGQO","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to tell you, in all honesty, I felt I was getting richer already just by chatting with Willie and Boyd yesterday.  Their insightful and detailed answers to all my questions about precisely how to invest my funds and shelter my income to maximize the net was exactly what I needed -- before I headed to Five Guys for lunch (wait for the weight loss part, it's coming!), I knew I was on the path to the highest tax bracket and would need to look to major corporations for inspiration about how to avoid all that -- and perhaps I was even on my way to being too big to fail!The premise of the book (well, premise is a bit rich - get it? 'rich') or guiding idea is that Boyd and Willie received a letter promising wealth and fortune from the ""Dollar Bills"" -- otherwise known as Bill Richter and Bill Lachey.  Their promises centered upon the need to project the right image in order to get rich -- one has to have the right car, the right clothes, the right drink, etc.  In other words, so long as you live the right lifestyle of being rich, wealth will follow.  After all, it worked for the Pilgrims -- our authors point out how much better dressed the Pilgrims were than the Native Americans they encountered (who couldn't even afford real hats!), and of course living in Crate & Barrel style homes, how oculd they not succeed.  (However, I must take the authors to task here; the Pilgrims were really more a Pottery Barn kind of people, but I digress.)There are the five C's (and no, I'm not going to tell you what they are -- otherwise, you wouldn't buy the book, and Boyd and Willie wouldn't be able to give me my kickback for trying to get you to buy their book) and five things to avoid, but then there are four other things you should do, and other things to avoid.  The book is a veritable checklist of wonderful activities all designed to get you noticed.  I particularly like the one where they advise you to go to a Hollywood hotspot and make it rain $100 bills.  This is guaranteed to get attention.  Oh, and please let me know when you do, as I'd like to be there, just for documentary purposes, of course.The weight loss portion of the book is equally as effective as the get-rich portion, and that's really saying something.  After all, as I said, yesterday's lunch was at Five Guys, a place preferred by President Obama and Brian Williams, and look how thin they are!  Yes, the inches were melting off so fast as I drove home from Five Guys that I had to stop the car to readjust my clothing several times.  And all from this book.If you watch Willie Geist's show ""Way Too Early"" on MSNBC, you might even rate a free book if you send an email inspired enough to be read on the show.If you think this review might not be all it is cracked up to be, well then, you just haven't read the book -- do so, and you'll understand.  But then, if you notice among the five things you should never do on page 114, you'll understand the credibility of my review by realizing that I am, for better or worse, a cat owner.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZFG03Y978VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312641532#wasThisHelpful","R2MZFG03Y978VM","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Episcopal pantheon of books, the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer are the top-tier books, the 'without which' that the Anglican world relies upon. Below this level are several second-tier books, those books which are also vital and useful, the books that no church or clergyperson tends to be without, and that most services in the church incorporate on a frequent if not regular basis. In this second-tier of books is the Hymnal, the Book of Occasional Services (those services not regularly scheduled enough to be in the Book of Common Prayer proper), and this text, Lesser Feasts and Fasts (now updated to its most current incarnation as ""Holy Women, Holy Men"").Usually, this book is updated every three years (at the General Convention of the Episcopal Church); however, for the most part, the text remains essentially the same from edition to edition, with certain additions and corrections, so that any particular edition has an effective useful life of a decade or so. This particular edition of 1991, therefore, is missing a substantial number of revisions over the years.  After all, think about it - the elder George Bush was president when this book was put out -- that now (unfortunately!) qualifies as a long time ago in terms of triennial revision cycles.  So, this is a book valuable more as a piece of the historic chain rather than for current practice.  However, one can't really go too far wrong with it - it isn't that anything is wrong per se as much as it is simply unrevised or unreconstructed (and there are many Anglicans who like that!).The book begins with a layout of the calendar of the church year. The first few pages are text that give the dates of principle feasts (or methods for calculating the movable feasts), holy days and major feasts, the fasts (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday), and days of special devotion and optional observance. There is then a twelve-page calendar, one month per page, of the days of observance for particular persons. The Anglican communion does not have the same method of canonisation of saints as does the Roman church; 'saints' as such are people accepted by communal assent as having led lives worthy of note and model, as appropriate.The persons here represented include saints common to the undivided church (prior to 1054) like the Disciples (sometimes with shared days), Cappadocian Fathers, early church figures (fathers and mothers, such as Monnica, Augustine's mother); figures of the Western church prior to the Reformation (Aquinas, Hildegard, etc.); figures unique to Anglican history (Lancelot Andrewes, Richard Hooker, etc.); shared figures in the broader Protestant family (Martin Luther, John Wesley, etc.); figures in American Christian experience, Anglican and otherwise (William White, Phillips Brooks, Samuel Seabury, Martin Luther King, Jr., etc.); and other twentieth century figures (Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Florence Nightengale, Evelyn Underhill, etc.). The list is constantly changing and growing, to match the spiritual needs of the community.All the two-page entries for the people (arranged chronologically through the church year) follow the same format -- there are collects (prayers for the day) for each, presented in 'traditional' language (thee, thou, thy) and modern langauge, reflective of Rite I and Rite II in the Book of Common Prayer. The other page presents a brief biography of the person or people involved, or a little explanation of the day (as in the case of All Saint's Day, or other such events). The listing also includes what propers are due for the day (the Biblical passages appropriate for services). Other sections include the propers and collects for days in Advent and Lent, the commons of saints, lists for eucharistic readings over different periods, and an index of names.When we did daily services at my old parish, long before I was a priest, we did not have music on those days. We had our 'daily trinity' of books -- the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Lesser Feasts and Fasts book. We would read the daily commemoration for the person involved, and then do an abbreviated eucharistic service, using the collect for the day prescribed in the LFF. I became very familiar with this text, and recommend it not only to Episcopalians, but also people who would like to add a cyclical and historical sense of time to their Christian practices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEFNVA1PGGPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898692288#wasThisHelpful","R2MEFNVA1PGGPU","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first thought when setting out to write this review was, 'Hmmm, I wonder how many irrelevant and obscure titles I can work into the review, that may or may not shed some light on the subject matter at hand?'I am a fairly well-read person (I am told I am too modest, and that I qualify as a very well read person, but I don't want to claim too much, lest some diabolic force leap forward to claim me back for my sin of pride, a particularly bad thing for those of holy orders, as every guide and advice to the priestly states since the days of Irenaeus). But I digress.But this is in keeping with the flavour of the novel. Unless you like digression, stay far away (run, don't walk!) from this novel. But, if you go in for the seemingly endless, barely understandable and eventually irrelevant, then by all means, this is the book for you.I would not have read this book but for the urgings of friends who were similarly reading this, and wanted to compare notes. Thanks, guys!Now, I must hasten to add at this point, I did find myself enjoying the book several times. I don't mind the digressions, but I found the attempts (subtle but there) to equate Corso with a Holmesian character unconvincing (and the attempts were subtle enough that Perez-Reverte could claim they aren't actually there). Apart from Holmes, he ignores most of English literature--when he talks of those who wrote in serial form, i.e, Stendahl et alia, he neglects those such as Dickens.I would love to have the card catalogue Perez-Reverte was sitting next to as he wrote this; perhaps he used Amazon.com and other internet searching to add that final irrelevant entry in each of the listings of books.I am a bibliophile. I sit in a room, such as Perez-Reverte describes in several places, where shelves sag on walls groaning from the strain of heavy books, heavy in content as well as mass weight. I have several such rooms in my home. But I couldn't quite find the same love of books in this book, where sometimes bibliophilia was a fetish, and other times a useless detail.Basic plot--is it a murder or is it a suicide? What does the manuscript have to do with it? Dumas (who wrote, among other things, the stories involving the Musketeers) is seemingly at the centre of things, along with a possibly-phoney book of occult forbidden knowledge, for which men will die (obviously) or kill. There is diabolic force at work, maybe. Corso is the rare-books expert called in to investigate the case, who doesn't always like the role of policeman.Perez-Reverte seems intent on impressing us with his erudition in the field of literature and continental travel. It would be impressive if it were consistent and organised along better lines, and woven into a story where such details made a contribution. This book, as a mystery, fails to deliver because it both gives more information than is necessary (which can be an effective device, forcing the reader to separate 'the wheat from the chaff', or figure out which strands to follow; sadly, that is not the case here) and insufficient information in the strands which count to allow the reader to 'figure it out' (another sin, often difficult to avoid when one is trying for a 'complex' novel; even Conan Doyle frequently failed on this point).In all, this is an inventive idea, with interesting character formation; for some reason, neither the story nor the characters get developed sufficiently (either in size or direction) to make this a first-class novel.The New York Daily News described this book as 'A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice' (Eco is very prominent here, as Perez-Reverte is obviously trying to emulate and cash in on Eco's prominence in the richer-and-book-purchasing English-speaking world). The New Yorker gets even more, well, New-Yorker-ish: 'A noir metafiction [please someone, tell me just what that means, in English??] Even a reader armed with a Latin dictionary and a copy of The Three Musketeers cannot anticipate the thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery.'Perhaps one of the reasons one cannot anticipate 'the thrilling twists' is the inconsistency in the novel? Just a thought.Escher-like...well, yes, you read one thing and it turns out to be another (for instance, I thought I was reading a great novel, and it turned out to be...)No, that is unfair. It is worth reading, but not devoting much time toward. Use as a diversion, not a devotional. I won't spoil the ending for you. I don't like it when others do that for me. You'll have to suffer as I and my fellow readers did to find out. You may love it! You may despise it! Yes, it is one of those books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XLRGSIK2FS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034YXY5C#wasThisHelpful","R11XLRGSIK2FS7","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book 'How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization' was a book I enjoyed reading; this audio presentation is a good companion, too (I love audio books for my drive-time). It presents an often overlooked idea, the importance of one of the longer-lasting and widely influential institutions in the Western world. It reminded me very much of Thomas Cahill's book, 'How the Irish Saved Civilization', both in content and in tone. Indeed, one of Woods' early chapters deals with some of the same information - the Irish of Cahill's text were primarily the monastic communities, and Woods develops this theme more generally (and more briefly) in his chapter.Author Thomas Woods, Jr. states that one of his intentions is to remedy the generally pervasive attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church these days in historical studies which is either negative or lacking in reference altogether. There are history books (quite often those used by the public school system) that try to downplay the role of the church in Western history or eliminate it altogether. In part this is due to church/state issues and fears on the part of textbook buyers; in part it is also anti-Catholic bias in society that pops up in different ways.I do have a few quibbles with the book. In trying to combat the negativity of much of the tone of the history of the Catholic Church, Woods goes a bit too far in the other direction at times. This is a balancing book, but it is not a balanced book - it is the argument in favour, and as such, overlooks at times the very real responsibility the church had in certain historical situations. Woods minimises where other histories tend to overplay, and neither stance is the best to take in interpretations. However, this is not a fatal flaw in Woods' narrative, it is the case that history built upon facts, and Woods doesn't play fast and loose with the facts.Woods primary intention does work fairly well - to give credit where credit is due, and much credit is due to the church for its influence in government, art, culture, education, and even in areas such as science (where the church is often most heavily criticised). Law in both the domestic and international sense owes much to the church, as does the idea of community charity, education, and civic engagement. Perhaps the most surprising chapter to me was the one on the church and economics, which introduced the idea of currency exchange and inflation being described in the literature of the Scholastics.The style is in a manner that is both accessible to the general reader yet interesting to those looking for something with substance. Overall, this is a reasonable response to the general negative tone in other texts. The importance of the church in Western history should not be denied, and Woods' book helps bring that to life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VACJXEVKGY1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786177446#wasThisHelpful","R3VACJXEVKGY1R","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Augustine's 'Confessions' is among the most important books ever written. One of the first autobiographical works in the modern sense, it also represents the first time a psychological and theological enterprise were combined. It also helps to bridge the gap between the Classical world and the Medieval world, exhibiting strong elements identifying with each of those major historical periods.Most undergraduates in the liberal arts encounter the book at some point; all seminarians do (or should!). Many adults find (or rediscover) the book later, after school. For many in these categories, there are concepts, narrative strands and historical data new and unusual for them. However, Augustine's 'Confessions' is still generally more accessible in many ways that truly classical pieces; it has interior description as well as external reporting that we are familiar with in modern writing.The 'Confessions' shows Augustine's personality well - he was a passionate person, but his focus wavered for much of his life until finally settling upon Christianity and the Neoplatonic synthesis with this faith. Even while remaining a passionate Christian and rejecting the sort of dualism present in the Manichee teachings, he varied between various positions within these systems. Augustine's varied thought reaches through many denominational and scholarly paradigms.The 'Confessions' are divided into thirteen chapters, termed 'Books' - the first ten of the books are autobiographical, with Augustine describing both events in his life as well as his philosophical and religious wanderings during the course of his life. The text is somewhat difficult to take at times, as this is writing with a purpose, as indeed most autobiographies are. The purpose here at times seems to be to paint Augustine in the worst possible light (the worse his condition, the better his conversion/salvation ends up being); at other times, one gets a sense (as one might get when reading the Pauline epistles) that there is some significant degree of ego at work here (Paul boasts of being among the better students, and so does Augustine, etc.).Augustine also uses his Confessions as a tract against the Manichean system - once a faithful adherent, Augustine later rejects the Manichean beliefs as heretical; however, one cannot get past the idea that Augustine retained certain of their intellectual aspects in his own constructions even while denouncing them in his official life story.The whole of the conversion turns on two primary books - Book Seven, his conversion to the Neoplatonic view of the world, including the metaphysics and the ethics that come along with this system; and Book 8, which describes his conversion to Christianity proper. This is where perhaps the most famous directive, 'Tolle! Lege!' ('Take and read!') comes from - Augustine heard a voice, and he picked up the nearest book, which happened to be a portion of the Pauline epistles, arguing against the undisciplined lifestyle Augustine lived. Scholars continue to debate whether Augustine's conversion to Christianity was more profound or more important than his conversion to Neoplatonism; in any event, Christianity interpreted through a Platonic framework became the norm for centuries, and remains a strong current within the Christian world view; Protestant reformers as they went back to the 'original bible' in distinction from the Catholic interpretations of the day also went back to the 'original Augustine' for much of their theology.The final three books are Augustine's dealing with the creation of the world via narrative stories in Genesis 1 exegetically and hermeneutically. This is very different from what is done in modern biblical scholarship, but is significant in many respects, not the least of which as it gives a model of the way Augustine dealt with biblical texts; given Augustine's towering presence over the development of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.This translation by Henry Chadwick is one of the standard editions of the book available. Chadwick, a noted scholar of early Christianity, provides a good introduction that gives synopses of the books as well as background and contextual information. This is a book that will be of interest to novice readers of Augustine as well as scholars, to students, clergy and laypersons, and anyone else who might have an historical, literary, philosophical, theological or other interest in Augustine - something for everyone, perhaps?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NCBB8RH9SC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014044114X#wasThisHelpful","R25NCBB8RH9SC0","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"House of Cards, a BBC production done at the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall, is one of the best modern political intrigue/satires done. The cast, the story, and the exacting attention to detail make this a piece worth watching and re-watching, to see what details escaped notice the first time.The PlotAs the story opens, Thatcher has just resigned. There is a brief glimpse of an inner-party election for a new leader, and the moderate, middle candidate Henry Collingridge wins the post, and proceeds to barely win the next General Election. Almost immediately following this event, tempers begin to flare as Urqhart is denied the promotion he had sought, and is disgusted with Collingridge's 'politics as usual' stance.Francis Urqhart, Conservative Party whip and functionary, with the unwitting assistance of a junior political reporter Mattie Storin, and the manipulated support of party functionary Roger O'Neill, sets out to undo the Prime Minister, involving the PM in scandals that rock his fragile majority and ever-loosening grip on power. Ultimately, Urqhart's schemes against Collingridge bring the PM down, and the stage is set for another leadership election.Urqhart, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth, works toward the leadership and works toward solidifying the loyalties of his minions, who include the ruffian Tim Stamper, an associate whip in the Commons, and Benjamin Landless, a newspaper proprietor. However, it is in making Storin his bedroom partner and virtual worshipper that Urqhart has his strongest support; this support is not absolute, something he recognises. This relationship is done with the blessing, nay, with the urging, of his wife Elizabeth.Urqhart uses his inside knowledge to make short work of all but the top contenders for the job, and then casts his lot for the job at the last moment, splitting the ticket. Knocking one contender against another one final time, Urqhart carries the election. However, O'Neill is unstable and unsure of the propriety of his dealings in bringing down Collingridge, and Storin realises at the last moment that she has been a pawn in a master political chess game. O'Neill's cocaine problem leads to his demise, as Urqhart plants poison in his drugs and permits O'Neill's nature to do him in. Storin discovers this murder plot, and confronts Urqhart, who confesses, but then proceeds to throw Mattie Storin bodily from the roof of the House of Commons.But, there was a tape recorder running, setting the stage for the sequel...`To Play the King' is the sequel, in which Urqhart matches forces against the newly installed King, played by Michael Kitchen. The King sees himself as the champion of the underdog and underclass Urqhart has abandoned, and it is a literal battle royale to the end. Storin has been replaced by Sarah Harding, who finds Urqhart is more than a match for her minor turncoating as well.Finally, `The Final Cut' brings things full circle, as Urqhart beats Thatcher's record of unbroken days in office. However, his lust for power drives him into reckless foreign affairs, and his wife comes into her own with scheming beyond measure.The CastIan Richardson is masterful as Urqhart, the scheming blackheart Chief Whip/Prime Minister. His voice, his subtle inflections and tones are perfect for the subtext in the words he speaks. His sidewise glances and knowing expressions to camera as the action plays out is worth far more than any words. He is a perfect snobbish, upper-class politico who considers political office as patrician right, and despises pretenders to the role.Diane Fletcher is superb as Elizabeth Urqhart, the equally manipulative wife. She is under utilised in this part of the trilogy, coming into her own as a character and an actress in later parts of the trilogy. One gets the strong sense of muted ambition and greed, but not amorality or power for power's sake from her, a distinction hard to play out on video. Fletcher succeeds beautifully.Susannah Harker plays Mattie Storin, the troubled, intelligent and inexperienced journalist who falls for Urqhart. Her psychological instability and intelligence are played beautifully. Harker can make quite a statement just with the movements of her eyes, making her a good counterpoint to Richardson.Miles Anderson plays the drug addict/party operative Roger O'Neill, doing a good job at playing the cad, the coward, and the fearful go-along with Urqhart's schemes. A rat trapped, O'Neill is at the breaking point, and Anderson plays this admirably.Perhaps the best secondary roles were performed by Alphonsia Emmanuel, who plays O'Neill's assistant and lover Penny Guy, and James Villiers, who plays Charles Collingridge, the deposed Prime Minister's troubled brother. Their roles shine brilliantly despite the relative lack of screen time.One gets the impression that everyone in British politics is brilliant and troubled. Well, the truth would be about half that.The Play's the Thing...This production, in writing and execution, is full of Shakespearean nuances. There are indirect and direct references to Richard III, and Urqhart is a Machiavellian manipulator in the Duke of Gloucester's image, recast for modern dress and situation, complete with stage whispers and asides to audience. The depth of the characters, while still remaining caricatures, is fascinating. Perhaps the best-known line for a while was Urqhart's attempts to get information out to the journalist Storin without actually telling her, and being guilty (by the letter of the law) for leaks and disclosures. She would hint and speculate, at which Urqhart would reply, `You might very well think that. I of course couldn't possibly comment.'John Major used this response in one of his own question-time exchanges, a use that was appreciated by the Members on both sides of the House.ConclusionsFor those who know nothing of British politics, this is actually a fascinating way to learn. For those who take an interest in British politics, this provides an intriguing fictional tale that is, in many ways, so close to reality on so many levels as to be positively unnerving.Richardson rightly won BAFTA awards for his portrayal of Urqhart in each of the three installments, House of Cards and its sequels To Play the King and The Final Cut. These sequels were possibly only because of a BBC change to Dobbs' original manuscript, which had Urqhart rather than Storin falling from the rooftop garden of the House of Commons.A bonus for the viewer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1QZ7VGZ7IRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HSIEPI#wasThisHelpful","R2B1QZ7VGZ7IRU","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book `Social Conflict: Escalation, Stalemate, and Settlement', by Dean G. Pruitt and Sun Hee Kim, is a text I used in a graduate course on conflict resolution.  At the beginning of the text, the authors state,  `Implicit in our definition of conflict is the deliberate exclusion of differences of opinion concerning facts and arguments over interpretation of objective reality.'They state prior to the quote at hand that they define conflict as the `_perceived divergence of interest_, a belief that the parties' current aspirations are incompatible.' (emphasis theirs)  The problem here is that this probably will involve differences of interpretation, and this is because they use the idea of perceived rather than true divergence of interest (which they explain in the footnote on page 8 sets them apart from many other social scientists in this field).  Perhaps what is really meant here is that they mean to exclude mere differences of opinion, upon which there is nothing at stake.  One might think here of theological discussions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin (the quintessential non-important question of medieval theology which was in fact never really asked and debated).  Or perhaps one might think here of conflicting views of what might have been the case had the elder President Bush not won the 1988 election, or had he won the 1992 election - perhaps of interest to some, but being hypothetical and having no real goods at stake in the outcome (since we don't have time machines to go back to change things) there's perhaps little applicability to discussing such moot issues.When I was studying the Supreme Court, one professor of mine made quite the point about how they do not decide moot points.  Each case is presented and decided upon on its own merits.  For the entire Constitutional Law class, the key point that the professor tried to make, in every lecture and assignment, was to stick to the case and the particular precedents and not go off on political or philosophical flights of fancy.We live in a world of nuance, in politics, in personal relationships, and in our conflicts.  As George Will once stated, `The truth is that, as a carpenter once said to William James, ""There is very little difference between one man and another; but what little there is, is very important"".'  Sometimes from the outside looking in, it is hard to see what the issue is.  Irving Janis, in his book `Groupthink', describes several scenarios where sometimes just the slightest change could have had the most dramatic consequences for change - matters of interpretation in the Bay of Pigs, the run-up to Pearl Harbor, or the escalations into North Korea and Vietnam showed where opinion did matter - not always the opinion between the classic confrontation actors, but rather within the decision-making groups on each side.Pruitt and Kim set out ideas that fit conflicts from fathers and sons over who gets the car keys to international actors on a global conflict scale.  Their definition of what conflict is sets up the theoretical framework, for which they trace the history of conflict resolution as a field before jumping in to discuss their particular models.In chapter three, Pruitt and Kim describe the Dual Concern model as one where there are two types of concerns, about one's own outcome and about the other's outcomes. These can range from indifference to high concern (Pruitt and Kim concede in a footnote that in fact there may be conflicts where there is a negative outcome expectation as well; total war with an unconditional surrender goal might qualify on that score). The dual concern model presents four primary choices in graphical representation, including contending and avoiding as strategies when concern for the other's outcomes are low, and yielding or problem-solving when it is high. Problem-solving is presented as the choice when there is high concern for both outcomes. Pruitt and Kim contend that this does not necessarily relate to motivations -one can be selfish and cooperative at the same time (perhaps the old expression, `Go along to get along' could fit this idea). One of the applications for this in international conflict could be the recognition that the leaders of most nations and groups in conflict are in one way or another representative of and accountable to the people upon whose behalf they contend. Hence, withdrawing and yielding are rare, unless there is indifference about the outcome. Pruitt and Kim cite Druckman's study that `negotiators who are representatives tend to be more reluctant to yield than are individuals negotiating on their own behalf'.Pruitt and Kim also discuss tactics toward conflict de-escalation and resolution that can be contentious, rather than helpful toward a solution.  However, the authors hold up nonviolent resistance as a set of tactics that are sometimes coercive (boycotts, strikes, etc., but this is not necessarily a bad thing) but not necessarily more effective than some other more coercive forms of conflict.  The authors also explore the Structural Change model, what happens when third parties intervene, and escalation/de-escalation issues.  A useful text for those going into diplomacy, job situations, and family settings - there's something here that can relate to conflict that arises in almost anyone's life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DET9HT65NLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0072855355#wasThisHelpful","R5DET9HT65NLN","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Episcopal pantheon of books, the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer are the top-tier books, the 'without which' that the Anglican world relies upon. Below this level are several second-tier books, those books which are also vital and useful, the books that no church or clergyperson tends to be without, and that most services in the church incorporate on a frequent if not regular basis. In this second-tier of books is the Hymnal, the Book of Occasional Services (those services not regularly scheduled enough to be in the Book of Common Prayer proper), and this text, Holy Women, Holy Men, which is the updated version of the more commonly known book, Lesser Feasts and Fasts.Usually, this book is updated every three years (at the General Convention of the Episcopal Church); however, for the most part, the text remains essentially the same from edition to edition, with certain additions and corrections, so that any particular edition has an effective useful life of a decade or so. This latest revision shows the most change of any of the past dozen or so incarnations of the book.In some ways, it is the same.  The book begins with a layout of the calendar of the church year. The first few pages are text that give the dates of principle feasts (or methods for calculating the movable feasts), holy days and major feasts, the fasts (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday), and days of special devotion and optional observance. There is a calendar of the days of observance for particular persons. The Anglican communion does not have the same method of canonisation of saints as does the Roman church; 'saints' as such are people accepted by communal assent as having led lives worthy of note and model, as appropriate. (The persons here represented include saints common to the undivided church (prior to 1054) like the Disciples (sometimes with shared days), Cappadocian Fathers, early church figures (fathers and mothers, such as Monnica, Augustine's mother); figures of the Western church prior to the Reformation (Aquinas, Hildegard, etc.); figures unique to Anglican history (Lancelot Andrewes, Richard Hooker, etc.); shared figures in the broader Protestant family (Martin Luther, John Wesley, etc.); figures in American Christian experience, Anglican and otherwise (William White, Phillips Brooks, Samuel Seabury, Martin Luther King, Jr., etc.); and other twentieth century figures (Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Florence Nightengale, Evelyn Underhill, etc.). The list is constantly changing and growing, to match the spiritual needs of the community.All the entries for the people (arranged chronologically through the church year) follow the same format -- there are collects (prayers for the day) for each in both traditional (Rite I, with thee and thou) and modern (Rite II, you and your) language, a brief biography of the person or people involved, or a little explanation of the day (as in the case of All Saint's Day, or other such events). The listing also includes what propers are due for the day (the Biblical passages appropriate for services). Other sections include the propers and collects for days in Advent and Lent, the commons of saints, lists for eucharistic readings over different periods, and an index of names.This revision of Holy Women, Holy Men retains all the people from the LFF, and adds about a hundred additional commemorations (lest one think this is too many, the Preface reminds the reader that this is the same number as 1964).When we did daily services at my old parish, long before I was a priest, we did not have music on those days. We had our 'daily trinity' of books -- the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Lesser Feasts and Fasts book. We would read the daily commemoration for the person involved, and then do an abbreviated eucharistic service, using the collect for the day prescribed in the LFF. I became very familiar with this text, and recommend it not only to Episcopalians, but also people who would like to add a cyclical and historical sense of time to their Christian practices.  This revision is a worthy one, which may be a bit disconcerting to those very much rooted in tradition (I for one will find it strange to type HWHM instead of LFF!) but as it includes all of the old together with some new, it is in some ways itself a via media.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3MROMOZNVEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898696372#wasThisHelpful","R2F3MROMOZNVEF","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first Sherlock Holmes book I ever read was given to me as a gift for my thirteenth birthday. It was a collection of the short stories, with a wonderful leather trim and gold leafing, and I thought it was fantastic. I read the first story, and was instantly hooked. Within a few days, I was disappointed with my wonderful new book because it was incomplete. I had devoured all of the selected stories, and was ready for more.Shortly thereafter, I purchased what purported to be the 'only complete Sherlock Holmes available', compiled by Christopher Morley (and it may have been at the time of its publication). This became my favourite book. However, I have continued to collect editions of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and this is one of those collections. It does contain all the short stories and all the novels, if you get both volumes (this is volume 1). It does not have illustrations or other commentary, and the print (in a double-column format) is rather small, but it is nonetheless a useful text for those who don't want to have a heavier book in their hands.The original stories, which appeared in The Strand magazine, were illustrated, by the great illustrator Sidney Paget.From the beginning introduction of Holmes and Watson to Holmes' gentle retirement to beekeepping on the southern coast of England, this book contains all the essential stories (none of the apocryphal, anecdotal, or tribute-written pieces are contained here). Holmes was often thought to be a real person, and Sherlockians the world over still search for 'evidence' to prove that he was. During his 'lifetime', the post office for the Baker Street area regularly received mail addressed to Holmes or Watson at 221B Baker Street. While such an address does not (and did not during the late Victorian era) exist, there is a business on the site that would be 221B, and they have dedicated a desk to Holmes, and strive to answer mail received in the great detective's name.Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.Holmes permeates other literature and venues as well. When Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation looks for images of Holmes, he is being guided by the descriptions in the stories as well as by the illustrations in The Strand. When the BBC produced Jeremy Brett's rendering of Holmes, the same holds true. When Basil Rathbone's films were cast, these illustrations and stories were uppermost in the directors' minds.So, pull some tobacco from your persian slipper, stoke your pipe, scratch out a tune on your violin, and re-enter the gas-lit world of the foggy London, where danger is afoot and one detective can always save the day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUPYMHCILKX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553212419#wasThisHelpful","R3BUPYMHCILKX0","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a taste of the Cold War at its height (and near its conclusion), Firefox is a great blast from the past.  They tried hard in the film to highlight all sorts of elements of the Soviet apparatus, including dissident scientists, Jews who were downtrodden and oppressed by the system, bureaucrats mindlessly following orders, the vastness of the country, and the intransigence of the pre-Gorbachev leadership.  The Soviet leader portrayed here is a kind of Breshnev-meets-Andropov figure, who is hoping for a technological leap above the Western powers.  This film also taps into the then-prevalent Western fears that the Soviets would make some kind of technological breakthrough that would tip the balance of power inexorably in their favour; of course, time would reveal that they were much more worried about our technological and economic advances with which they could never really compete.  But that's too complex for a film like this, which is already a spy-thriller, chase, and military adventure film rolled into one.  It succeeds for the most part on these levels - Clint Eastwood plays the still-having-flashbacks pilot drafted into the mission of stealing the new MIG-31, a plane so technologically advanced it can operate on mental commands, but limited enough that it would only recognise them in Russian (Eastwood played a pilot fluent in Russian).In a somewhat strange role, Nigel Hawthorne (one of my all-time favourite actors) played the key Russian scientist, reluctantly but effectively developing the technology, but just as effectively determined to help it be stolen.  Many of the other actors are British, including those playing Russians and those playing Americans.  All are reasonably effective, though there are few stellar performances here.The special effects are very good - John Dykstra of Star Wars fame produced many of the elements in this.  Scenes of flying in the cockpit and the dogfights between the planes are very effective; they were more dramatic, in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.In all, this is an interesting film, a bit overlooked now because time has moved on past the subject matter.  It is one of the earlier films produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who has gone on to much bigger and grander projects, but one can see his touch here.For the second film in this package, one also gets a later Cold War scenario, this time in the tropics rather than the frozen Siberian arctic.  Eastwood plays a tough-as-nails, no nonsense Gunny who has to whip a sadsack platoon of misfits into fighting Marines.  Good thing he's a Medal of Honor winner, something that irks his desk-bound, procurement specialist commander to no end.  There are lots of stereotypes here - no complete Gomer Pyles, but several close seconds.  Of course, the administrator/commander is against everything the Gunny wants to do, but the wiser general in the end saves the day for Gunny, as he and his platoon save the day for students trapped on the Caribbean island as Cubans try to take over.  And the film ends with a rousing parade, unlike the return from Vietnam.On the whole, two good killing-time films; far from great fare, but entertaining, especially for those who like a military theme (friends of mine in the USMC particularly like to sit and pick out the technical problems with Heartbreak Ridge!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDMSTVFOP0MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029F21JC#wasThisHelpful","RPDMSTVFOP0MD","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Paul Tillich is one of the more important theologians of the twentieth century. Born into a culture being enticed away from the importance of things religious and theological in favour of science and philosophy. In particular, in the early part of the twentieth century, the philosophical school of existentialism became a strong, perhaps even the dominant force in intellectual development; it was against this (and the atheistic, nihilistic tendencies that followed) that Tillich undertook to reintroduce theology and faith as important components of human existence. Tillich, much to the consternation of many seminary students and more general readers, largely addresses the academy in the academy's language - he is very philosophical and precise in his constructions, and like many in the long tradition of German theologians, crafts his theology with his own terminology and internally-defined concepts that often make his theology difficult to follow.This text, 'Dynamics of Faith', is one of Tillich's more accessible writings, more directly relevant to the situation of individuals and congregations. Tillich here looks at what faith is, and is not, from a theological perspective, but his intention is to make this transformative for the humanity that seeks to understand God.In the first chapter, Tillich introduces one of his key terms - ultimate concern. Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned about something - God - without conditions or reservations. Ultimate concern can be religious or not, and can be misguided (people are tempted into idolatry, according to Tillich, not only by making things such as money, power and fame the objects of ultimate concern, but also by making particular ideas or views of God and religion into inappropriate ultimate concerns). In the second chapter, Tillich explores the ideas of what faith is not - faith is not merely intellectual understanding, emotional bonding, or even an act of will. Faith is rather (going back to the first chapter) an act of total personality - one's whole being is drawn to the ultimate concern.Through the remainder of the text, Tillich develops an intriguing idea of the symbolic in faith - symbols are not constructed like marketing logos, but rather assume a life of their own and participate in that to which they point, in a community context over time. Community is important to Tillich for symbols and for faith, as it is through community that we develop the language and understanding skills necessary to codify and understand such things. Tillich looks at the different disciplines of science, history, philosophy and reason, asking (perhaps echoing Pilate in a different manner) what is truth? Tillich clearly states that neither scientific nor historical truth can negate or validate the truth of faith, and vice versa. Philosophical truth is a different matter, given that the 'language' of faith, through theology, is often expressed in philosophical terms - however, even here, philosophical truth and reasoning cannot be used as a trump card. However, for the truth of faith to be affirmed, the faith must be focussed upon the 'real' ultimate concern.Tillich often irritates modern Christians because of mistaken assumptions about what he means. In other texts (such as his massive 'Systematic Theology', also often used in higher-level seminary and graduate courses on theology), Tillich describes God as a Ground of Being, and as such, having no 'existence' as we commonly use the term; this gets reduced to the soundbite 'God does not exist', and Tillich is written off. In 'Dynamics of Faith', Tillich often refers to 'cults' and 'myths', using these terms in specific scholarly manner, to refer to religious and biblical issues and events - again, the soundbite becomes 'Tillich says that the Bible is a myth', and given the popular non-Tillichian definition of the word 'myth', again Tillich is dismissed.There is much material packed into this small text. It is worth exploring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8YMTTBSO9LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018EEU1W#wasThisHelpful","R8YMTTBSO9LJ","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In just a few months, it seems, the third edition of this text will be out.  This speaks to the staying power of the text by Ramsbotham, Woodhouse and Miall.  Conflict resolution in the context of this text is really international relations and politics on a large scale.  When I told a friend of mine that I was doing a course on conflict resolution, her first thought was to ask questions that showed she thought the subject was one of interpersonal relations on a small scale - conflicts within families, between neighbours, co-workers and employer/employee relations, etc.  My course, being a part of the National Security Studies program at AMU, did not address that (worthy though friend's idea might be in another setting).  In the preface, the authors state, `We produced the first edition of this book in order to provide a comprehensive account of the way in which conflict resolution emerged as a field of academic enquiry and how it might be utilized to manage post-Cold War conflict peacefully.'  While there are certainly parallels between interpersonal relationships and international relationships, this text is focused clearly on the later.The authors set the stage by looking at some basic concepts of conflict resolution models, different levels of conflict, and different ways of thinking about the roles of the participants.  Classic approaches to thinking about things such as the Prisoner's Dilemma as well as new models that involve multiple parties at varying levels of concern and participation provide many examples both theoretical and historical.  Tracing the development of conflict resolution from the post-World War I environment forward, the authors see three main periods: the inter-war period with stumbling efforts, the second generation post-World War II with more sustained development in conflict resolution research, the third generation during the Vietnam and post-Vietnam war era, and a reconstructive fourth generation from the mid-1980s to today.  In this period, `Conflict resolution does not prescribe specific solutions or end goals for society, beyond a commitment to the core assumption that aggressive win-lose styles of engagement in violent conflict usually incur costs that are not only unacceptably high for the conflict parties, but also for world society in general.'Conflict can take many forms - terrorism, more formal warfare, economic sanctions both effective and ineffective, interstate and intrastate conflict, and more.  The authors devote a significant amount of the text to looking at ways to interpret conflict before moving on to chapters on peacebuilding, the ethics of intervention, and reconciliation.  The authors conclude on a hopeful note, discounting various theories of doom and despair.  `Conflict resolution and conflict transformation insist that, although human conflict is inevitable, the path to violence is not.  It offers robust criteria for guiding policy choices in the positive handling of potentially damaging conflict, set within equally clear-cut principles for addressing underlying structural or cultural asymmetries.'  This is no pie-in-the-sky text that promises peace and equity everywhere in every way.  However, it does look for people at all levels to take both a local and global view of their actions, something that our increasingly shrinking world needs.  A key word here is transformation - not a simple cessation of conflict, but rather changing it into something that can be less destructive, and possibly even constructive in different ways.Useful for those who want a sense of conflict around the world, this book is good for anyone studying political science, international relations, security-related studies, sociology, and more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FXXJW5JDT6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745632130#wasThisHelpful","R17FXXJW5JDT6M","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the back of my copy of Kitto's book, there is a quote from Raymond Mortimer declaring this volume to be the best introduction to Ancient Greece he had ever read.  I'm not sure if I can go that far with regard to this book; perhaps in 1957, when it first came out, that accolade would have been appropriate.  However, just because I can't declare this book to be the best unreservedly, I still consider it to be an excellent text, and one that I have very useful in my upper-level undergraduate course in Ancient Greek philosophy.Kitto has relatively short chapters on a host of subjects, including origins, culture, warfare, political life, philosophy, art, and more.  These are arranged according to certain major facets of Greek life that we know - for example, Homer gets a chapter to himself.  However, Homer neither arose in a vacuum nor did his work only matter during his (or her) time.  Kitto doesn't address too much about the academic controversy over who Homer might have been, but rather addresses the work that we have which survives.  That work includes an exploration of the direct and indirect influences on later generations of Greeks, who in turn have had profound impact on our own culture.Kitto spends a good deal of time on the political structure of Greek life, from the early settlement and migration times, to development of small polities, to larger hegemonic times and the Athenian empire, brief-lived though it was.  One question I ask my class to address out of Kitto's text is this - Sparta seems to have won the war, but Athens won the peace; what does this mean?  Kitto gives a lot of insight into the competition between Athens and Sparta, and to a lesser extent other polities around the Aegean and off toward Italy; there were unified times in the face of Persian aggression, but more often there were less organized times, which allowed for a kind of international relations in microcosmic form.  I once had a professor who longed to teach a modern international relations course using nothing but Herodotus and Thucydides - one reading Kitto can get the sense that there are many truths in this desire, given that many of the motivations of nations and many of the principles of politics among nations remain the same as can be found in the speeches recounted in Thucydides' writing.Kitto clearly has a deep love of the ancient Greek culture, and parallels much of his own time with this period; he is also quick to point out the differences.  This is perhaps the one weakness of this text.  If one lacks a familiarity with Britain and British sensibilities and learning in the first half of the twentieth century, one may lose some of the references Kitto makes - for example, he makes reference to the Sophists as being akin to those who might host a seminar, `Did You Want to be a 1000GBP Man?' - the answer would be a resounding no today; he also alludes to `our political parties' which are clearly different from those today (and for those in North America, one might have really no hook upon which to hang understanding).On the other hand, some things haven't changed.  He also says of the Sophists that `Perhaps ""Professor"" would be a rough modern equivalent to ""Sophist"".'  A challenge to remember, indeed!  This is certainly something my students can understand.  He also uses colourful stories such as Diogenes calling to both the perfumed set and what would be the Greek grunge set, `Affectation!'  He also pulls from Herodotus the disappointment of Croesus at finding out that Tellus, Cleopas and Biton led happier lives than he (but alas, that they were dead, too...).  There are many pieces that stick with one upon reading, and because this text does not go overboard in information, it fits together in a more easily grasped framework, too.One might challenge Kitto's assertion that the Greeks were as superior as they are presented - `unless our standards of civilization are comfort and contraptions, Athens from (say) 480 to 380 was clearly the most civilized society that has yet existed.'  However, there is no doubt that the Greeks advanced in directions hitherto unknown and rarely exceeded in a measure-by-measure analysis.  This comes through with Kitto - a worthy text for a worthy subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ5HM7XCW2BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI9VIA#wasThisHelpful","ROZ5HM7XCW2BY","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this text as a supplemental text in my Existentialism class.  I might wish for a few extra pieces, particularly from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, in foundation for Existentialism, and most particularly because the editor of this volume, Robert Solomon, has done such admirable work on Nietzsche in other volumes (`What Nietzsche Really Said' is one such text).On the Phenomenology front, Husserl is well represented.  This is supplemented briefer pieces by Frege, Merleau-Ponty, Brentano, Ryle, and Solomon himself.  As Solomon's introduction states, Phenomenlogy `takes the Cartesian attention to the primacy of first-person experience and the Katin search for basic ""a priori"" principles as its modus operandi.'  I recall first studying Husserl through his `Crisis of the European Sciences' in which the modern-to-postmodern project of science is seen as needing a stronger philosophical underpinning if it is to answer the fundamental search for meaning rather than mere description.  The drive of the scientific enterprise to begin with no presuppositions and to take a kind of radical empiricism in approach.In the Existentialism section, Solomon includes Ricouer, Merleau-Ponty, Marcel, Heidegger, and Sartre, with a bit in the final section by de Beauvoir and Camus as well.  Solomon writes in the introduction to this portion, `The existentialists shift the focus of phenomenological investigation away from Husserl's demand for a ""rigorous science"" and towards the question, ""What is it to be a person?""  They place a new emphasis on ""lived experience"" rather than knowledge.'  Of those represented here, Ricouer and Marcel interest me the most, given the way they incorporate the elements that my Existentialism class, as part of the religious studies curriculum, looks at the topic.  However, the breadth of the texts means that this collection is good for anyone looking for an introduction to the early work on Existentialism.The volume of work in the area of Phenomenology and, particularly, Existentialism has grown over the last few decades to make any selection of recent texts a near impossible task, but even this volume of earlier works represents a major work of selection and editing; Solomon's notes along the way provide a good framework for context and interpretation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWO1Z2DIQDSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0742512401#wasThisHelpful","R2TWO1Z2DIQDSH","A2VE83MZF98ITY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VE83MZF98ITY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Invicta watches, to me, are like Ford cars. Ford aped the look of the Aston Martin in their front grills, a touch of class. But no one is going to mistake a Focus for a DB9. Likewise, Invictas are reminiscent of fine Swiss watches, and the quartz (not mechanical) movement in this watch is Swiss, but it's also a watch that costs a couple percent of a watch that James Bond or a banker might wear. Okay, we've put the label and the aspirations aside, let's look at the watch itself.First off, this is amazing packaging. Not as minimalist in design as Apple packaging, but clearly many (most?) of these watches are intended to be gifts. I think anyway receiving this watch would admire the packaging. Now the watch, it's 45mm in diameter (pretty large) and quite thick (13mm quoted in the specs) with a 22mm wide band. Most of my watches are leather band, but a nice metal band is a noticeable dressy item. I think the band looks good, and adjusts nicely onto my (medium to large) wrist. The fit and finish of the watch was okay, and the appearance is definitely a classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JDD38GV5HNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y8RQ#wasThisHelpful","R12JDD38GV5HNB","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a satisfying heavy watch, with a look intended to be reminiscent of fine watches (such as the blued screws) that I happen to like a lot. From a distance you see the main dial with the large hands and no hour numbers. The twelve o'clock subdial is a 24 hour hand and the six o'clock subdial is the seconds. The fit and finish of the watch is good. The water resistance of the watch i quoted at 50m (swimming, but not snorkeling or diving) and I haven't had cause to question that.One person who saw the watch likened it to a cross between a Skagen and a big dive watch.

"McClintock's ""Lost Antarctica"" was a great book, so I jumped at the chance to pick this one up. And that is despite my personal lack of interest in angling/fishing. (I was told that I needed to take up fishing when I had a planned snorkeling and diving trip to Belize scheduled. I fished from the shore, and it provided some tasty food, but hardly anything fun. Spear fishing on the other hand...) The individual chapters of this book (see below) stand essentially as independent essays focusing on one location and one fish, with some science and/or environmental developments to go along with it.1. Chandeleur Islands - Speckled Sea trout and their ecosystem2. Manitoba - Lake trout, climate change and drought3. The Cahaba River (Alabama) - Spotted bass and nutrient poisoning4. Gulf of Mexico - Yellowfin tuna, their biology, and the oil spill5. Antarctica - Toothfish and why their blood doesn't freeze6. New Zealand - Rainbow trout and the cod fishery collapse7. Bahamas - Bonefish and coral reefs8. Costa Rica - Tarpon, sea turtles, and puffer fish neurotoxins9. France - Anchovies and their processing10. Fishing for solutions - Some possible solutions...Over-fishing, climate change, sea acidification, and expanding human impacts are leading to the collapse of many, perhaps most, of the world fish populations. There aren't really simple answers and the author approaches the issues from both a scientific and a fisherman's appreciation of the fish angle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMYCHE9WQLWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279907#wasThisHelpful","R3PMYCHE9WQLWW","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is something inherently alienating about the concept of travel writing, and Theroux himself spends some quality time in this book discussing the too-often-displayed travel hardship model of travel writing. Part of it here is the notion of the Cape Cad and Honolulu-dwelling great writer (outsider right there) traveling primarily through the African-American Deep South of poverty and an utter lack of books. As always, there's the outsider to write about the experience, but this is a passionate outsider who, I think, empathizes greatly with those he writes about. In fact, the more I thought about this writing process the more I realized the alienation and the notion of difficulties inherent in the writing said about my willingness to discuss race rather than anything the author was doing here.As one who greatly respects Theroux's travel writing (most relevant to this book is the fabulous Dark Star Safari (and its lesser sequel of sorts, The Last Train to Zona Verde) and it's stinging critique of development funding in the third world) I took the rambling style of the book for granted, and enjoyed the odd byways and partially realized stories of the people encountered in the book. Theroux took trips through the South over the course of several years, and only a few of the tales seem completed. Mostly those that ended with deaths. It's as it is in the real world, ongoing stories, and any visitor only gets to see the briefest of moments.The pre-publication copy of the book I saw did not have photos, but if the ones on the amazon book listing page are any indication, they're likely to add quite nicely to the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSGIZC26FXBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544323521#wasThisHelpful","R3MSGIZC26FXBB","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We might meet some familiar characters along the way, but it's their familiarity from older material that makes them interesting, not their new treatment. Alice and Wonderland have been fertile ground for many re-imaginings over the years (including the under-rated SyFy Channel Alice) much as Oz has been.

Try not to spray too much, but small applications on ornamentals as needed is okay by me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTW3Y0484X0RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ACPOBW#wasThisHelpful","RTW3Y0484X0RF","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard for me to picture exactly who the target consumer is for this herb and vegetable kit. They are easy to start, and the plants are up and seem happy, but this makes for a very small garden.

And it's a bit pricey for what you get, though to be fair if you only want one of each plant, seed packets are pretty wasteful.Okay, the plants, all germinated and look good, there's fertilizer in the growing mix and the early growth was especially fast.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9L7VJFEAM87G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P99KHUU#wasThisHelpful","R9L7VJFEAM87G","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bitch Magnet. Hmmm...I remember the name, but definitely never saw them, unless maybe they opened for The Damned in 1989? I didn't see them at All Tomorrow's Parties when they reformed, but had seen some of Jon Fine's excellent music journalism over the years. I went ahead and re-listened to the albums while I was reading the book, and it all does fit together into a sensible package.Music autobiographies are a touchy business. You need to make something readable for both the fans and hopefully new fans to be, be sensibly nostalgic about great times but not be a bore or completely stuck in the past, slag on those other bands that did better financially but not turn into an exercise in bitterness, and make it clear that you're cooler than the reader, but not a total a-hole.So, success by and large here. I got a feel for the touring, and for the attempts at success during ""Indie Rock's Failed Revolution"" which is, to my taste, a nearly perfect subtitle. It was a time of great hope for small scale music going big. Interesting sounds that could sell records (okay, CDs). At the time I was in Chicago, and the energy was amazing. Liz Phair learning to play guitar and then selling a bazillion disks. Veruca Salt making it big. No more hair bands in the charts.Anyway, I enjoyed the book and that's enough for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8WDX1Y5APY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002659X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8WDX1Y5APY5","A31BD4RXCON7QO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31BD4RXCON7QO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The good - it works as it's supposed to. The mop is good and absorbent and holds just the right amount of water when spun out to let me damp mop a wood floor without worrying about it, and if you DON'T spin it out, it holds enough water to get my whole tiled kitchen good and soppy wet, but WITHOUT dripping when I lift the mop up.  Seriously, I've never had a mop that held this much water and DIDN'T drip before, I'd love it just for that.  Also, my kids are not excited about mopping because the spinning is so cool! :-)  I mean, really, how can you beat that :-)  The bucket is easy to assemble, easy to drain, I had NO problems with the plug leaking.  I like the way it breaks down to store the bucket inside the other bucket.The bad - ok, think about  this and it should be obvious, but people seem to expect that the spinning will leave you with a clean mophead.  It will not - it spins out the dirty water, yes, but it does nothing to RINSE the mophead, so whatever dirt is in the mophead will get into the 'clean' side of the bucket.  That said, I did find that the 'dirty' side was significantly dirtier than the 'clean' side, but don't expect the 'clean' side to stay pristine.  It definitely is cleaner than the old one-bucket method.The ugly - they SERIOUSLY need to come up with a latch system for holding on the mophead rather than the 'snap it in and pull it out' system.  You are supposed to spread the mop out on the floor, place a foot on either side of the mophead, and pull straight up.  This is a HORRIBLE idea.  For one, I'm SURE that over time, I will pull those strings out from stepping on them.  But more importantly, the first time I did this, I BLACKED MY OWN EYE when the mop handle came out and hit me right in the eye socket!  Ouch!!  Please, please, be very careful when taking the mophead out, don't do what I did!!That said, I do like it, and will keep using it.  It's a good mop and it does what I want it to do - just from now on, I'm going to make sure it's pointing away from my face when it's time to take it apart...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9CN3ONUQPFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9CN3ONUQPFY","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is fun game for people who like 3D puzzles in real-time, and I'm also pleased with how well it works as a puzzle.  It works like this - you have a board with 7 round spaces on it (a circle of 6, with one more in the middle) and rows around it for storing three each of five different colors of spheres.  The player boards are a heavy, thick cardboard, and - clever bit here - they are held up off the ground slightly by three thick foam circles that you put on the back of each board.  I was a little concerned that a cardboard playing area would not hold up well for a real-time game, but this is so sturdy that unless you have a fairly destructive kid, it should be fine.  Yes, a determined person could bend the board and ruin it, and make sure the kids don't leave it on the sofa and sit on it.  But a minimal attention to care should let these last a good long time.  The spheres are exceptional quality - heavy plastic, heavy enough that I'm reasonably sure they are solid through and through, and the surface is lightly textured so the spheres don't slide around on each other.  Which is good, because in this game you have about a minute to build a sort-of pyramid with 7 spheres on the base, 3 in the middle, and one on top.  Where the game comes in is, you also have six cards in front of you that show the parameters for your pyramid - qualities like the blue spheres can't touch other blue spheres, or there have to be exactly 2 orange spheres, or the green spheres are only allowed to be on the top level.  There's a huge deck of these qualities, and with six in each game, the replayability is really high.  Sometimes the cards contradict since you are drawing randomly - there's a point system for how many of the qualities you can solve for with a given pyramid, so you can either accept that you can't get ALL the possible points sometimes, or you can toss the contradictory card and draw another - there are PLENTY in the deck.Now, my nine year old son LOVES puzzles, but doesn't like to be timed, so he's just been drawing cards and working out a solution, starting with four cards at a time, and working his way up.  So, even if you don't care for the timed aspect and just like spatial puzzles, I'd highly recommend this, you can absolutely play it just as well as a spatial puzzle.

And big bonus for parents - the headphones only cover one ear, so none of this ""What?

"This game is the third in a series of similar games.  You play a character that you develop with new items and skills over time, gaining new stuff every time you win a game.  You and your fellow characters work together to explore a number of locations that varies depending on the number of players, making die rolls to defeat monsters, disarm traps, or acquire various helpful things, from new allies to new weapons.What's new about this entry in the series is that it adds cohorts (special allies that are with you at the start of the game and do not count against your card limit), mythic paths (a way for a character to become super powerful by gaining and discarding mythic charges), and the corrupted/redeemed trait on some items.  It adds a high level of challenge to what was already a challenging game.  The very first scenario in the game is meant to be a sort of easy introduction and a chance for the team to get some good items for their characters before going on to the more combat-heavy episodes.  I played this with two other people.  Each of these games comes with several episodes already in the box, and then adds several small expansion packs  that can be used to add several more episodes each.  I had played through the original base game and most of its expansion packs.  One of the other players had played through the entire first game and all the expansions and most of the second game's expansions too, and the third player had played through both base games and all the expansions, many of them twice.  We got our butts kicked :-)  It is definitely a challenging game, and if you are familiar with the system and have been wanting a tougher version, you will love it.  If you are new to the system, I would suggest getting the first title in the series, Rise of the Runelords because it will be much easier for you.

Seriously.  If a child really wants a private journal, this is NOT going to be it.The password feature itself is also very very picky - you pretty much have to pick a one or sometimes two syllable word and say it with the exact same intonation each time for the password feature to work.  Even then sometimes it would not recognize the correct password by the correct person.

"I absolutely love these!!  They come unshrunk, so wash them before use - the care label says cold wash, but that's clearly ridiculous for a kitchen use item,. so I washed mine on hot.  I figure if that ruined them, then I wasn't going to use them anyway as I'm not going to use kitchen linens that can't take enough heat to kill germs, right?  Well, I needn't have worried - they turned out absolutely fine.  I line dry mine because they are so thin, I think the dryer might wear them out prematurely.  But they line dry VERY quickly, as little as 20 minutes on a hot day.They are terrific for drying dishes, too.  They are nice and large, so you only need one for a small load, or two for a typical family dinner for four load of dishes.  The most I have needed is three towels for a larger than average load..

"I got these for my daughter who is taking an art class in high school and wanted some watercolors to experiment with for some Japanese inspired watercolor paintings.  These worked a lot better than the ones available to her in her class.  She still was not happy with how bright they are, she wanted brighter colors, but at least she said these were considerably brighter than the ones she had been trying to use.  They are easy to clean up - the paint seems to cling to the brush better than cheap watercolors do, so it's easier to get everything where you want it, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QASMV9JL6II/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSEAID2#wasThisHelpful","R30QASMV9JL6II","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We really wanted to like this, but I'm afraid it just doesn't work very well.  It's very messy & easy to spill.  When we filled it with cold water, it was a little painful on the gums.  Our bathroom water isn't filtered, so warm tap water isn't very tasty for us.But worst of all, we just couldn't figure out how to get it to floss properly.  Every time anyone used it, we used regular floss afterwards and got debris out.  It just didn't seem like the water flosser was actually flossing...  Maybe we used it wrong somehow, but we read the instructions and they seemed clear.  But even the high pressure didn't really seem to do a lot.  Wouldn't recommend it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKYCTMI2HVZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQQ0ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2GKYCTMI2HVZB","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to use as a homeschool planner/grade book for my high school aged daughter.  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for - I had been having a hard time finding a notebook that had enough room for both daily work and still had a monthly overview.  Each month has a two-page spread with daily blocks that are about 1 1/2 by 2 inches, which is plenty of room for me to write the grades for that day.  After that, each week is spread over two pages, with about 7 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches for writing for each day.  That is plenty of room for writing down the assignments & appointments for that day.  And bonus - there is NOT pre-printed subject area stuff or anything else - you don't have to pigeonhole your life into someone else's idea of what works for a homeschool like so many of the academic calendars or grade books I keep running into.  There is also a very large Notes section in the back - perfect for keeping a running reading list or writing down trig formulas or whatever she needs.It is a very pretty teal.  The cover is flexible plastic, so should hold up well.  I am a little concerned that it won't be stiff enough & will bend as the year goes on, as my notebooks tend to get stood up for storage, I don't lay them flat.  So I will need to be careful with this to make sure it doesn't get flopped over too much.  But small price to pay to get a decently formatted calendar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG2TMYDDQY40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0B1TN2#wasThisHelpful","R2DG2TMYDDQY40","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router really seems to have helped with some persistent device range issues we've had - before I got this router, I couldn't download anything onto my Kindle Fire when I was in the bedroom, and there was one spot on the sofa where you could not sit & have a phone conversation.  Both issues are SOLVED now, yay!!!I am not a tech person, and this was very easy to set up for me. I just turned off the old wireless & plugged this in.  You DO have to rename the wireless on the new router to make it talk to your computer, I didn't do that at first & got very frustrated, but my husband pointed it out.  If you can plug things in & change file names, you can set this up.I have a teenager, so the parental controls are nice, and easy to set up.  It also had log files so we can monitor what is being done.My husband says we cannot access the router from outside the network, and apparently we should be able to.  He says  the linksys smartwifi app says  the system is offline & it's not.  I have no idea what that means or why it matters, but he told me to put that in for you tech folks :-)  Apparently it is something that will let your control your network when you are not home?

"I LOVE to listen to music while I'm doing housework, and I'd been on the lookout for a replacement for my 20 year old CD 'boombox' for sometime - this was the perfect choice!!  I've also recently switched from an android phone to an iPhone 5C, so the fact that this system would play music from my phone was a big plus.The sound is terrific - much better than both my old boombox and my phone on its own.  (And the phone sound by itself was already an upgrade from my previous phone!)  I'm not a serious sound expert or anything, but everything sounds GOOD and like I expect it to sound. I was listening to some old 80's songs that I had previously listened to on my old boombox, and had just assumed I was tired of them because on my old boombox they just didn't sound very exciting any more.  But popping them in this system WOW!  They sound so much better now!!Mostly I have used the CD player for audiobooks from the library, and the phone dock for iTunes radio and my music.  Both work just fine - I guess some older versions of this had problems with the CD player, but they seem to be all straightened out now.  I have not really used this to listen to FM radio, sorry.  Since I use this in the kitchen, I was also pleased that it is mostly smooth plastic, no unnecessary design elements that make it hard to clean.  The manual buttons in the back are small and a little tucked away, they might be a little hard to clean if they get dirty, but since they are not front & center they are not likely to be affected by a spill or something like that, just a little normal dust.  That's what compressed air is for :-)My only complaints - the instruction manual is a fold out one sheet, very thin paper, like a big thin paper map.  That was really annoying, but since you barely need it because it is pretty easy & intuitive to use, I'm not too bent out of shape about it.  Also, I have to take my phone out of its protective case to fit it into the dock, but I guess that's pretty standard, I just dislike doing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBBPCHVIR5JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD4SYSO#wasThisHelpful","R3OBBPCHVIR5JF","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice edition of this classic game.  They kept the retro art, which is very cute.  The gameplay is simple, basically you play mile cards to move ahead, hazard cards on your opponents, remedy cards on yourself to fix the hazards opponents play on you, and safety cards to protect yourself from hazards.  The worst thing about this game is that you have to wait until you draw a Go card to start moving at all - it's like in Sorry! where you have to get a 1 or 2 to get out, so if that doesn't bother you, this won't be a problem.  It doesn't bother us, but some people get irritated with the slow start to the game.The rules booklet is kind of a mess, I'm afraid.  It was kinda hard to understand - I own over 200 board games and read a LOT of rules, so believe me there are worse rule books out there, but for this simple of a game, it should not have been that hard.  For an example, the rules for the two to four player game at one point informs you that if an opponent plays a hazard on you and you happen to have the remedy for it already in hand, you may play it immediately instead of having to wait for your turn to apply the remedy.  Fair enough, but  the rules then go on to say that this is different from the ""Coup Fourre"" move.  There is no ""Coup Fourre"" move in the two to four  player rules.  That move is in the team play rules.  So why mention it at all in the two to four player rules?  All it does is confuse.That said, other than the rules this is nice.  It comes in a nice small tin & the cards are reasonably thick.  If you don't already know how to play this game, though, look up the rules elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYE7R5N6SU8FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXSJSC0#wasThisHelpful","RYE7R5N6SU8FH","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, it might seem a little weird to review a notebook, they all are the same, right?  WRONG!  The Mead line of sewn binding notebooks are our absolute favorites - I just got this one as a review sample from Vine, but we have used the wide rule, college rule, and the graph paper versions of these for YEARS - I won't buy anything else.  The paper is sturdy enough to not rip when erased (you'd be surprised how often that happens with cheap notebooks), the lines are never off-center from the previous page (something that sends my future engineer daughter into fits), and as a left-handed person, I REALLY appreciate not having to develop a row of spiral bound indents on my hand when I need to write something!  My soon-to-be-third grader took off with this notebook for a board game design project he is working on, I just looked through it and see that the lines are perfect for him to write legibly on after 'graduating' from the primary loose leaf paper we used with him in second grade.  After fifth or sixth grade (depending on individual hand-eye coordination and general neatness) we switch to the college-ruled.  We go through at least a couple dozen of these every school year, absolutely the best!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ENAHIMNGPJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IDM7#wasThisHelpful","R34ENAHIMNGPJQ","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...then this is the book for you!  This is the second of her books based on her popular Dinner: A Love Story blog.  The first book mostly tells how SHE did it, this second book breaks it down & tells you how YOU can do it.  It's a menu-planning guide for giving yourself a 30-day reboot to enjoy cooking again.  It is NOT a beginner cook's menu planning guide!  This will have you in the kitchen daily, breaking down recipes into prep steps to pre-prep as much as possible, AND getting the rest of the family involved in cooking too.  An experienced cook can bread cutlets while directing a child to wash greens and remember to make twice as much rice so you have some for Tuesday's dish, but a beginning cook might end up weeping in a corner with all that going on at once!  You have to know what you are doing & be organized enough to keep on top of a lot of little details.The first thing you do is pick a start date (she suggests the following Sunday, whenever that may be), and  then get your family to help pick recipes.  This was the part that almost made me quit before we started!!  My husband picked REALLY elaborate and/or expensive dishes.  I vetoed the Middle Eastern delicacy that called for $35 worth of fresh herbs (and that's not even counting the lamb!), but I did make the cabbage rolls that had four sub-recipes and took three hours to complete.  My daughter picked out nothing but Chinese dishes.  My son picked out quiche lorraine, ham & cheddar frittata, bacon & monterey jack scrambled eggs, ham & swiss hash with poached eggs - seeing a theme here? :-)But we are halfway through, and it IS working.  The kids are really enjoying rating their picks, and I'm having more fun cooking now.  Believe it or not, it was the three hour, four sub-recipe cabbage rolls  that was the turning point.  At first I thought that was CRAZY - my weeknight family dinners have been in a rut of protein with a sauce, steamed veg, and rice or bread (I have the only kids in the world that don't like potatoes).  So it has been awhile since I've done anything that took longer than 30 minutes, and it HASN'T really been fun cooking for a long time.  But, I made the sub-recipes ahead of time, and as I was stuffing the cabbage rolls with the help of my eight year old son, I realized that I was having fun again.  I liked taking the extra time to make it more interesting!  I liked the challenge of trying to make Ma Po Do Fu as authentically as possible (Szechuan peppercorns really DO numb your lips!).  And it was great to see the kids getting excited when 'their' picks came up.  So, it's working really well for us!  I would recommend this to anyone who likes cooking as a hobby but is having trouble incorporating it into their busy life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0ZRAR03ESAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549805#wasThisHelpful","R1K0ZRAR03ESAF","ABOVQ74OQRZCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOVQ74OQRZCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got these for my daughter to use for her Drawing for Engineers class.  She came home the first day RAVING about these & how much nicer they are to use than the Derwent or Faber-Castell pencils she had been using before.  They give much cleaner lines and allow her to be more precise in her drawings, while still going on dark and clear.  She showed me some of her work & she's right, the new drawings look much more professional than the old ones.  She also uses them for regular drawing sometimes, and says they are great for sketching too, she just uses a lighter lead.  The erasers also erase very cleanly without a lot of debris.

"This book was an o-k read for me. I'm a reading specialist teacher who works K-5. I know some girls (and a few boys) who would enjoy reading this book, but they have very aligned interests too.At the elementary level a lot of kids tend to lean either to heavy fantasy or non-fiction. I like that this book bridges that gap, though I am personally not a fan of the 'real' animal images used.The reading level is appropriate for any student who reads at mid-late 2nd grade level in terms of ease of language. The content/story is honestly more suited for kindergarten. HOWEVER, gives quite the subject-matter vocabulary boosts and does a decent job of representing much harder terms with images.Overall, I think it's an okay book and would work well for the 2-3grade readers who are interested in the topic of cute fuzzy animals who help each other. 'More advanced' readers would find it babyish and developing readers (who would gravitate to the content and story) would struggle with the reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13KOLF352Z0V1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545873339#wasThisHelpful","R13KOLF352Z0V1","AKCZIJ6ZHE41D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKCZIJ6ZHE41D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally the answer to needing extra storage space WITHOUT tipping the stroller with a shoulder bag or backpack.I like that it works with my folding stroller (City Mini) as well as it might work with any general umbrella stroller.Why it might not be the perfect fit for you is you like to carry your extra stuff everywhere you go. This isn't really meant to be a carry-around bag. I often resist having 100 different bags with all the same stuff in it.

"We always have pizza Friday in our house, and we have a picky bunch of pizza eaters. This little oven is GREAT for quickly cooking a variety of pizzas.While the directions call for you to place the pizza directly on the ceramic plate, this isn't possible with most take-and-bake pizzas. For example, with Papa Murphy's you HAVE to use the provided tray. The pizza does cook well enough, but the crust gets done sooner and the center of the pizza isn't quite as crisp, though it is cooked through.Frozen pizzas can go directly on as well as well some pre- or partially baked crust pizzas (such as mini personal pizzas the kids love to make).It's nice not having to fire up the entire regular size stove to get our pizza's cooked, especially as the summer approaches.You are limited to 12"" (which is generally a medium pizza). Also this has a fairly large foot print, so if you don't have a dedicated counter space for it you might run into problems. I have a small prep cart I use for storage and this is where it lives.Overall, if you're a pizza lover and prefer smaller baked-to-order pizzas, then this might be a great option for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMELJYY5X7BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R2UMELJYY5X7BZ","AKCZIJ6ZHE41D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKCZIJ6ZHE41D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are a 2010 Subaru Forrester household with three kids. I am in a constant quest to find seating options that support 3-across seating.So far the Diono Radian has been the ONLY seat to accomodate our needs.Diono in general are heavy duty, extremely well constructed seats. No complaints on that end.If you go off the specs alone you'd think this booster has the same or even a slightly smaller footprint than the Radian...this is absolutely NOT true.While base measurments are similar, the Monterey opens up like a butterfly. Seat maximum width is 18in compared to the Radian's near 14in. Back and shoulder width for the Monterey is a hair over 19in compared to about 16 for the Radian.These are huge differences for a household that wants their children safe but can't afford a new car to accommodate these larger boosters.Look, Diono is in line with every other standard booster out there, plus they are much better quality. IF you do have the space then know the Monterey is an EXCELLENT booster and very comfortable. I appreciate the efforts to keep it narrow and have swing-out cup holders.However, if you are like me and have limited seat space in your car I would HIGHLY recommend the Radian as a solid booster to 100lbs. All you might need (with either of these styles) is a seat belt buckle extender so little hands don't get squeezed and scratched digging down for the buckle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6PCF6HK1MFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MQRBFE#wasThisHelpful","RJ6PCF6HK1MFY","AKCZIJ6ZHE41D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKCZIJ6ZHE41D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This definitely gave a boost to my ab workout, but I do offer a word of caution: when it says consult your doctor or whomever, think about that seriously.I didn't try any new moves with this mat that I don't normally do EXCEPT for the side situp, which is much more intense with this mat.

"I've had many types of screwdrivers over the years and plenty of power drivers (including Black and Decker, Ryobi and Craftsman)I have to say this is probably one of the most thoughtfully packaged screwdrivers you can get for the money.Seriously if you only ever buy ONE to have around the house for small jobs and projects, this would be ideal.It comes with many of the standard screw heads, plus some oddball allen and hex heads. It also has a narrow-tip Phillips head as well, which is very handy if you're dealing battery compartments.The built in light is a useful and valuable feature if you aren't a head lamp owner,  but even if you are, the driver itself will often block the light.A built in charge meter won't have you guessing about how much battery life you have left (which is typically the case with past power drivers).And compared to other power drivers this one is LIGHT and maneuverable.The only minor qualm occurs when trying to pivot the head: I'm still trying to figure this out without engaging the trigger.

"This is a pre-summer review based on fit and past brand comparisons.I'm super, super picky about the sandals I get for my kiddo. They have to be closed-toed first off. Second they need to work wet and dry. Third they need to offer a felxible footbed support. Fourth, they need to provide all around foot protection. Fifth, they should keep his feet fairly cool, dry and fit well so blisters won't form.In the past I purely bought Keen Newport H2 sandals. They were often too heavy and stayed wet too long, but provided excellent protection for all summer activities.Last summer we tried Teva Toachi's. These kept his feet super cool, but super exposed. Yes they are closed-toed but otherwise his feet were about as exposed with regular Teva sport sandals and the increase of injury ensued. That said, he liked them.He never had any rubbing or blistering issues with these other shoes. They were not easy for him to put on or take off by himself (either pair). Neither of the other pairs have much growth flexibility. The Teva toe strap is purely decoration. So if you choose either you should wait till you absolutely need sandals in case your kiddo's foot has a sudden growth spurt.What I am liking about these Timberlands (which come in at the low end of the same price point as the other two):-Comparable construction falls between the Keen and Teva. More airy than the Keen while less exposed than the Teva.-Easy on and easy off for my kiddo. Yes he's 5 now, but this design would have been easier for him at 2 as well.-Flexibility for growth of foot. The way the shoe is designed helps to hold the foot in place even if it's not touching the end. Leading off of this, the sole of the shoes is more flexible across its entirety than either of the two other shoes. Keen is the least flexible and Teva has good flexibility just at the ball of the foot.-Though my son's feet aren't wide, these shoes could accommodate a wider foot.My concerns looking forward to everyday summer use are the sweat and contact rubbing with the neoprene lining. I assume these won't be an issue as my son's foot should be a snugger fit.Overall I feel confident about these sandals but realize that choosing one of the other two might make sense depending on your needs.Much more water play: Teva.Much more rocky terrain: Keens (for their thicker, more rigid soles especially)The Timberlands, however, appear to be a good middle ground sandal.Will update this review further in a few months.UPDATE 1: the boys wore these around over the weekend with no complaints once we resolved a small issue. When both boys put the shoes on there was a question about the ""tongue"". On both shoes (though I thought I was being attentive) I missed a place on the inside top side portion of the shoe that should go over the ""tongue"" but got trapped under it. This rubbed the feet the wrong way. Be sure when strapping on the shoe that all the edges are where they should be so no unnecessary discomfort or rubbing occurs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MPEQ4SPTEQNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M15DG80#wasThisHelpful","R2MPEQ4SPTEQNS","AKCZIJ6ZHE41D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKCZIJ6ZHE41D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the cheese grater I've been looking for! I know nothing about Joseph Joseph, but I know a whole lot about cheese: not only do I make some of my own, I love to cook with it, too. And I cook a LOT -- it's part of my job. So I'm always on the lookout for kitchen gadgets that: (a) work well; (b) are easy to clean; and (c) save space... because the space in my kitchen is unfortunately finite.This grater has impressed me on all counts. It's easy to use to shave cheese over a plate, or you can attach the slide-on cover and neatly grate away. The cover even has measuring notches on it so you know if you've grated enough. Once done, wash the thing by hand OR run it through the dishwasher and slide that cover over the top to keep the grating surface sharp while protecting your hands.As if that's not nifty enough, you can press a button on the side to swivel the handle so it works like a kickstand and holds the grating surface upright over your cutting board. With that easy-peasy move you can grate as much cheese -- or chocolate ribbons -- as you'd like.I find this so much easier to use than my box grater, particularly since I have arthritic hands.

"I received this caddy as a gift after putting it on my Wish List. It's the second one I've owned -- the first having lasted two years before I dropped it during cleaning and cracked the wood on the front edge so deeply that it hurt my arms the next time I used it to read in the tub. Between the two, I briefly tried a different bath caddy which I liked at first but which held my book so high over the tub that I couldn't get comfortable while trying to read.This caddy is perfect. The way the wire extension arms on the side shaped means the tray sits about an inch lower than the top edge of your tub. That was important to me since the other caddy actually raised my book 1 1/2 inches over the edge. There are ample drainage holes so water doesn't collect, but it's a good idea to dry it off after use anyway. (I learned with my first one that if you don't dry it the arms will eventually grow rust and the finish will start wearing off.)Most importantly, for those of us who love to read or watch Netflix on their iPads or Kindles in the tub (just slip them in a Ziploc bag and you're good), the book rest is angled perfectly for tub reading/viewing and the grooves on the tray really do keep your book/tablet from slipping. That wine glass holder is pretty nice, too.I absolutely love this thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39O2W4PBZBMT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00176AOKM#wasThisHelpful","R39O2W4PBZBMT7","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a gift for my birthday and it's one of the best ones I received! I soak in the tub nightly to deal with my arthritis. Not surprisingly, that means I've tried a lot of products that promise to make my bath time more comfortable. Until now, I thought finding a truly comfortable bath pillow was just a dream: I've had several, and most of them have been a disappointment. The vinyl-covered bath neck roll put a kink in my neck. The plastic-covered single-piece bath pillow wouldn't stay in place. The larger plastic-covered pillow was okay but there was such a huge gap around the suction cups that it quickly developed mildew, plus it wasn't much of a cushion.This pillow feels like your head is resting on a bed pillow in your tub! The seam between the neck roll and the rest of the pillow allows me to perfectly place the roll to support my neck, and the rest of the pillow is wide enough that my back doesn't touch the hard tub. Between the strong suction cups and the fabric pillow cover I no longer feel like I'm sliding all over the place, too. I use this for an hour nightly and was very surprised to find it was bone dry the next morning, even though I didn't wring the thing out. That's important to me since I don't want it to get mold or mildew but, thanks to my arthritis, there was no way I'd be able to squeeze it dry as I feared I'd need to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OID5H4CYT24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TG9TG3I#wasThisHelpful","R12OID5H4CYT24","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I received it as a gift since I'd added it to my Wish List as part of my plan to add more blues to my bland living room. This rug certainly packs some punch! Although it appears somewhat faded and powdery blue on screen, it's actually more of a turquoise in color. That worked with my color scheme, though I wasn't prepared for how vivid the color is.

"Twelve years of blogging have taken their toll on my posture and waistline. With recent health studies proclaiming that ""sitting is the new smoking"", I decided it was time to look for a standing desk. There are plenty of industrial- or commercial-looking standing desks, but I wanted one that worked with my home decor. This one looked like it would fit the bill, and I liked the price, so I ordered it. Based on its looks, I figured I could always use it as a home bar in the living room if I didn't like using it as a desk. But, wow, have I been impressed!I assembled it myself in 20 minutes without any problems (you only need a medium-sized Phillips screwdriver) and set it in my home office where I can easily move my laptop from my regular desk to this one. The first day I could only stand for 20 minutes at a time, even with an anti-fatigue mat, but I kept working at it. Now, just a few days later, I'm spending most of the morning at the standing desk, followed by a quick (seated) lunch, and then I alternate between the sitting and standing desks for the rest of the afternoon.Of course, I wish I could add ""and in that time I've lost 10 lbs!"" or something life-changing like that. Sorry, but it's only been a week. I can say that my posture is better, and that my Fitbit says I'm getting a lot more steps in throughout the day (probably because it's easier to pace when I'm thinking now). Oh, and I notice my creativity improves when I work at my standing desk in the morning -- maybe it's just the increased circulation, or maybe it's the change of view, but whatever it is, it's been nice.So I wholeheartedly recommend this desk for anyone who's been thinking about getting a standing desk. I wish I'd bought this years ago!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HO8ZUKNEFZU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUKG6DO#wasThisHelpful","R2HO8ZUKNEFZU1","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've hated our deck table and chairs set for years due to the inferior cushions they came with. Being a plush-bottomed woman, you'd think I had enough cush on my tush that any ol' chair would be comfortable, but you'd be wrong. The cushions that came with our chairs were so thin that I'd feel the seat's supportive webbing straps beneath me, and the back cushion provided little to no support. Last year, I got fed up and replaced them with a set I picked up at Home Depot, but within a week they, too, felt flat and unsupportive. (It wasn't just me; my thin family and friends agreed.)Both of those sets were essentially just fabric over squares of foam, as cheaply made as they were priced. This year, I decided I'd pry open the wallet and get a GOOD set, maybe not top-of-the-line but several steps up from what I'd been used to. Saw these, and both the description as ""overstuffed"" and the button tucks (or whatever they're called) made me suspect they'd be firmer. Boy, was I right!These are fantastic cushions: sturdy, solid, and plush (like me!) but at a price that I liked. I bought mine slightly out-of-season, so I got a set of two for $37.43 but see they've gone up considerably now that it's officially spring. Even at the current price, they're worth it. They do feel top-of-the-line, with support both beneath and behind, and the fabric is as vivid as it is on screen. My deck furniture looks new now that I've swapped cushions, and both I and my guests are quite comfortable.

"This tea, which I received free for evaluation,  is a delight for the senses. The Fab Flowering tea looks absolutely gorgeous as it steeps, particularly when made in the Tea Beyond clear glass teapot (of which I'm not as fond). Watching the tea flower open, like its blooming, is mesmerizing. Surprisingly, the tea tastes good, too, and being able to make several pots from the same tea flower is nice.I love a good Earl Grey, so I was particularly thrilled with the double bergamot tea in this combo. The Jasmine was far too strong for my taste on first brewing, but after a second round it had mellowed and was enjoyable.But the Caramel Black Tea ROCKED my world. A splash of milk, a cube or two of sugar, and it's like drinking dessert. I've never tasted anything like that, and almost wasn't willing to give anyone else in the house a chance to try it. I finally relented, and they were just as impressed.

"I'm an avid tea drinker, so most evenings I brew a small pot of a Pu-ehr or an herbal tea if I have an early morning. I also collect tea-related decor and love to display it in my kitchen. When Tea Beyond offered to send me a tea pot for consideration I jumped at the chance. Although I'd seen a photo of this teapot online, I was not prepared for the delicate beauty of the thing.This glass pot with built-in infuser was designed by Jane London, owner of Tea Beyond. It's a lovely, organic shape made of perfectly clear glass. On top sits a small glass butterfly which, honestly, is a bit girly for my tastes but I'm sure some find it cute. Using the teapot couldn't be easier: boil a kettle on the stove, preheat the glass teapot with hot water from the tap, and when your kettle whistles dump the glass teapot then add boiling water and insert the infuser filled with tea leaves. Once your tea is ready simply lift the infuser out, return the lid to the pot, and pour.Do note, this is a small teapot. Since it's glass it doesn't keep the tea warm for long at all, which is fine because the pot will be empty after pouring tea for two.But as the headline says, it is a very, very delicate beauty. By the end of the first use the handle on mine had cracked at the bottom and tea began leaking out. Not fun! I've kept the teapot because it's attractive and looks nice with my other tea decor, but I obviously can't use it since it leaks. Even if it didn't, I'm not sure that I'd use it very often -- since it only makes enough tea for two people, it's easier to microwave mugs of water and pop an infuser into each.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQOBT2AOGTLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPUH6SI#wasThisHelpful","R3CQOBT2AOGTLU","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a recently-converted Whovian who binge-watched the Doctor Who reboot for free, then bought this season so I'd be caught up before Season 9 starts. As a result, my first Doctor was Eccleston, and I liked his brooding yet manic energy. When he regenerated, I was upset (I didn't know the premise) but it took less than one episode for me to start raving about Tennant. He, too, came across as simultaneously contemplative and boyishly enthusiastic. When he, too, regenerated it took me several episodes to begin liking Matt Smith, but by the middle of Smith's first season I was crazy about him. And then came Capaldi.I like Peter Capaldi. I think he's a phenomenal actor, and I can't say I fault him for anything that seems to be going wrong with the show, but there IS something wrong with the show. The Doctor's love of humanity and all other species has been replaced by scorn. How many times have we heard the Doctor say to some hideous new alien, ""Look at you, you're beautiful!"" but now the Doctor seems condescending and disdainful. He's unlikeable and, frankly, he's downright mean. All of the enthusiasm and compassion is left to the companion to express and, although I do like Clara, the series is supposed to be about the Doctor. This season seems to have lost sight of that, just as it's lost all of the verve in the writing.Supposedly, Moffat intends to change things up in Season 9 to make the Doctor less dark, and the companion less the focus. We'll see. Rule #1: Moffat lies. Moffat has also said that Doctor Who has at least five more years, which makes me think he doesn't grasp that Doctor Who has and will continue to exist regardless of Moffat, and he owes it to the series' legacy to contribute to the mythos, not destroy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0Q7K3BVMNVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MASEPTC#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0Q7K3BVMNVR","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players (the more the better). It's very similar to the card game called ""Joker"", using numbered cards like Joker does, but with the addition of ""Karma cards"" that provide some vicious twists. The cards are laid out the same: three face-down table cards, three face-up table cards, six cards in each players' hand to start, the deck to draw from, and a discard pile. Game play is simple:1. Player one draws a card from the pile and discards one from his/her hand.2. Player two draws and then must play a card with the same or higher number. If unable or unwilling to do so, the Player can play a Karma card.3. And so on until a player runs out of cards in his/her hand and moves to playing their face-up table cards followed by their face-down table cards (but without getting to see those first).4. The game ends when a player has no more cards, including table cards, to play.The ""Karma cards"" cause twists like forcing another player to pick up the entire discard pile, or to move the card from the bottom of the pile to the top, or other game-changing surprises.My son and I played it together in a game that I called after the first hour. Turns out, the fewer players you have the longer the game is. The next time we played with three friends in a game that lasted around 20 very fun-filled minutes. It's now one of our favorite games to play when we have company.As far as an age range, I think kids as young as 8 could easily understand how to play this while there's no upper-end to a player's age because it's fun for adults, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RFY1VKNDNFLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ7FH1M#wasThisHelpful","R2RFY1VKNDNFLM","A36MS27KAA5S26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36MS27KAA5S26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On cold winter nights (or evenings after a bit too much wine) I dread having to stand at the sink washing makeup off of my face. Since I'm at a certain age where ignoring skin care is just not an option, I needed a convenient solution and have found it in these wipes. They do an excellent job of removing makeup. I use one side and start with my eye makeup, which is the most stubborn, before giving the rest of my face the once-over. When I flip the wipe and use the other side I hardly ever find any residue left behind. That's impressive!Also, as someone with sensitive skin, I've noticed that my skin tone has improved since I started using these.

"I read this book the week following my own husband's death. Knowing it's a memoir, I wasn't looking for a self-help book but, rather, for insight into another woman's feelings in the long days and longer nights following the loss of her spouse. What I found, instead, was a screed written by a weak, petty, odious woman who never once discloses that she remarried just 13 months after her husband's death, which she portrayed as so devastating that it sent her spiraling close to substance abuse and mental illness. At the point she angrily rants about the gifts of fruit baskets and food sent by well-meaning friends and acquaintances -- gifts she found so offensive that she somehow overcame her torpor and out to buy additional garbage cans so she could throw them away. Yes: she chucked them in the trash, rather than giving them away or donating to a shelter or food pantry.

Although it took us a couple of rounds to grasp the rules (not that they're hard, it was just different from anything we'd played), once we caught on we found this to be quite a bit of fun. The artwork is cute, and the concept is very original. We can get a game in at the kitchen table while dinner is in the oven (and you do need a long table since you're laying out 8 cards in a row), which is just enough time to have fun but not so much that he starts whining about wanting to get back to his video games. We rotate this with playing Mr. Jack, Gubs, and Mastermind -- depending on our moods. Spending a half-hour a night hanging out with your teen might not sound like much, but it's really done wonders for our relationship: we talk more about what's going on in his life, he listens better to me now that I'm spending regular one-on-one time with him, and the teenage drama has plummeted.

I didn't spend a dime and I had three Disney movies ready to play!  In addition, we had PBS Kids, Disney Junior, Pinterest, Facebook, etc.  Not only can you work straight from the apps, but you can open your browser and search as you please!

I think there are other low carb snacks that fit the budget better, but for the occasional treat, these worked well for us!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAFZ7DPMX5QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8JXJ7E#wasThisHelpful","R1NAFZ7DPMX5QV","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The IZOD Sueded Fleece tops are one of the few that my husband will actually wear.  He owns several. He is small framed (5'8"" and 140 lbs) and a medium is generous in size on him. A small would be too short.  He loves it. It washes well and the color remains sharp. If you are looking for others that are similar to this, the IZOD 1/4 zip sueded fleece is also very nice. Solid 5 stars from a repeat buyer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KN3N6FWOLBXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SLUNDS#wasThisHelpful","R1KN3N6FWOLBXV","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son needs insulated work gloves for his snow removal in the winter. He also uses them for cold days when he is doing late Fall landscaping. Last year, I purchased two pair of Carhartt Men's Chill Stopper Waterproof Insulated Work Glove at $40 each for him.  By comparison, I like these much better. There are no loose stitches, the fit is nice, love the flexible grip and insulation. It's a comfortable glove, even for me!Highlights:~ Price point is GREAT!

"Eukanuba has always been a trusted brand for pets, but as new dog foods arrive on the shelves, you may find their are better out there from a nutritional standpoint.

From minute one, both the 100 pound Lab and the 19 lb Shitzu began going crazy when they heard me open the can.  They have both been eating it for three days now and we have had no upset stomachs or loose stool.  It was an easy transition and they are happy.

"I am more than pleasantly surprised with the iRULU 7 inch Quad Core Kids Tablet WITH PARENTAL CONTROLS!  It is speedy with no lag, has a clear, sharp picture and is a great size for kids or adults on the go!Highlights:~ Parental Controls which allow you to control how much screen time your child can have before a break.~ Comes with rubber bumper case, so no need to buy anything extra.~ Get Apps/Movies/Books/Music directly from iRULU (coupons included!) or from the Google Play Store~ Set your Home Screen for the child version or adult version~ Very easy to navigate  I have to admit, I am more than pleasantly surprised by the iRULU 7 inch Quad Core Kids Tablet!  The battery arrived charged enough for me to get started right from the box.  If you are giving this as a gift, it is quite easy to set up in advance and have it ready for your child!  The tablet is very easy to navigate.  Internet Safety is everything to me. I like that I can keep the children protected with the advanced parental controls. Not only can I limit what they see and do, but I can limit their screen time.  I can simply input my password to extend their play time, if desired.  I was amused when I was playing around with it and I got the message for me to ""take a break"". You can set the message you want your child to receive.  For me, this was a true bonus!  I added the PBS Kids and Netflix apps to see how well television shows and movies played! Flawless! As you can see, I added a ton of apps and still had plenty of room for more!  The battery life and wifi connection has been great! I played for about two hours the first night and went from 100% battery life to 86%  I think that is a good indication of your play time!  I had no difficulty getting a wifi signal in any room of the house or out on our deck.  Overall, I am still impressed with this tiny powerhouse!  No, it isn't an iPad, but I am all for the price point with the safety of parental controls! ** I have added several pictures for your review!  Please note that any clarity or light/dark issue is from the camera and definitely not the tablet. I wanted to give you an idea of what you would be receiving! I'd be happy to take more pictures or answer any questions you may have!iRULU rules! I will be looking at their other products with a new perspective now that I have had the opportunity to try this one.

"OtterBox has been a trusted brand in the industry for many years. They are known to build cases that last and cases that protect your investment.

"This is my second Four Paws Metal Hands-Free Gate. I want to love it! It is sturdy and works great, but this is my second quality control issue that I have had.  My first gate had hardware that wouldn't thread properly. Customer Service was prompt in replacing it.  This gate arrived sealed, but with brown (rust??) stains on it? I am so very disappointed. I tried removing it with Chlorox Clean Up and  a Mr. Clean Eraser, but only some came off. I have uploaded pictures for your review. It is certainly not a piece that I can or will use in my home...as I am sure you can understand by seeing the pictures.  If you get one that is good, then you will enjoy the hands-free aspect and that is tall so the typical dog doesn't jump over it.  It does hold sturdy to the wall using pressure mounted screws.  I just can't get past the quality control issues. I know that ""things happen"", but this is the 2nd gate that I will have had to contact customer service about.

I am that jeans and sneakers kind of person who actually needs to wear sneakers due to a foot injury I sustained.  I love my Fastwitch and then the Cohesion by Saucony. I saw these and thought I'd give them a try!  They fit as expected and found them to be as comfortable as my other Saucony's. I did not order a half size up as others have suggested. They fit exactly as my Fastwitch and a smidge smaller than my Cohesion, if you are familiar with either of these by Saucony.  The colors are bright and happy (See picture below!).  Great price point on these! I purchased them because I couldn't afford to replace my Saucony Fastwitch this week!  I love them! I am happy to have found something else I can wear on my feet!

My only regret was that I didn't have purple cabbage in the house to boil, but there were enough other activities that I did have the supplies for (or were included with the kit!)Highlights:~ Value and Educational~ UNIQUE - something fun, different and scientific~ Well made~ Good price point for gift giving!~ Loved the two quality ""kits"" - one for each girl!  The book gives you several ways to send messages to be decoded.  We only were able to do a few of them on the first day because I didn't have a few of the supplies necessary. It was a lot of fun to write with the wax crayon and then use the ultra violet light to see the message!  We also were able to fold paper (origami) in the shape of a heart and create a message inside.  In addition, we created our own vocabulary to decode messages using the decoder wheels. All in all, time well spent - educational and fun.  NOTE:  We opted to laminate our decoder wheel and use a brass holder to keep them together. This way, we will be sure they last a long time!  They are heavier duty paper (waxy cover), but this will make them last even longer!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FFWW8TZDKYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGM5KFK#wasThisHelpful","R22FFWW8TZDKYV","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We enjoyed the Scientific Explorer Ice Age Creator Kit. It comes with everything you need for the Wooly Mammoth's habitat - icy pond and snowy landscape with ice on the trees.  I have uploaded several pictures for you. Please note:  This project was completed with a 7 year old.Highlights:~ Easy to follow instructions!~ Nice quality Wooly Mammoth!~ Educational and fun!  Create ice crystals, snow and ice for your Wooly Mammoth in his habitat.  The instructions are easy to follow, but please note that this is a one and done type of kit.  You will receive enough to create your landscape, but then you are on your own if you want to make more snow or crystals.  The Wooly Mammoth is nice quality and he will be yours to keep for a long time!  We thoroughly enjoyed creating this habitat for our friend, ""Wooly"".  The kids were able to make the ice on their own.  I helped measure the water to make the snow. Their eyes LIT UP when the snow just kept growing! It was great!  The kids lacked the patience to wait for the crystals to develop, but when they looked at it the next morning the said, ""OH WOW"".  For me, this is a great gift to give to a child. It helps incorporate science, learning and sensory all in one!  I like the price point! It makes a great birthday party gift for a child's classmate or that hard to buy for child that has everything. There is no way they will have this one!

"When I was a little girl, Pie Face was released for the first time. It was in the toy catalog and it was on my every Christmas list for years!  I never got it. Well clearly, my parents weren't as much fun as I am as a parent. It does not make this ""big mess"" as they said.  It's a fun game and it keeps the kids laughing and laughing!  When I saw this was released again, it was a dream come true. I couldn't believe it! I had searched for it for years hoping to get it!

"The Four Paws Metal Closing Dog Gate is of sturdy quality and is big!  Our 100 pound Labrador couldn't jump it if he wanted to.  A first impression is a lasting impression.  Ours had a piece of defective hardware, so I am working on getting a replacement screw.Please note:  I misread the description and assumed it was adjustable up to a wide doorway, but that is not the case. This will fit the doorway only if it is between 35.75-39.75"" wide.  It is too large for a standard doorway.  So please be sure and measure first.  Installation is very simple and straight forward. You will have this up on your doorway in just a matter of moments. It comes in one piece and not sections that you have to assemble.  Simply pop in the 4 pressure mounted screws and you are good to go. It does come with 4 additional caps and screws that you can put into your woodwork if you happen to have a dog that is determined.  When our dog was a puppy, we purchased the Carlson Pet Gate (only 31 inches in height, but expands from 29-44 inches and half the price) and that has been fine for us. Keeping in mind, the wider the doorway, the less sturdy that gate is.  Unfortunately, our gate arrived with one pressure mounted screw that simply will not thread.  It happens and I certainly will not hold that against the company. I will give this gate a 3 star rating while I wait for my replacement screw.  .  I will update my review upon receiving my replacement pressure mounted screw. I was hoping to use this on our front door on Halloween! As adorable as a 100 lb Lab can be, it can be intimidating for anyone coming to the door to his friendly face.  The Four Paws Metal Auto Closing Dog Gate is very sturdy and one piece construction.  It is great for that perfectly wide doorway and the determined dog.  It does have a higher price point that the adjustable gates, but this is taller and sturdier at that width!

"Let's just say I was intrigued to try the Hachiko Smart Dog Sensor.  I could think of several useful purposes! As a parent, I would love the kids to be the ""owners"" and log when they have fed and walked the dog.  From a spouse standpoint, I would like to know if either one of us has given the dog his medicine.  Most of all, I love seeing the activity just like my own activity tracker.  First impressions:  Packaging is simple, but so is the product.  Set Up:  Set up was very simple. Download the app on your iPhone 5 or later and you are ready to begin. I used this on an iPhone 6S and the app was flawless.  Next, it is time to attach the band to the device and wrap it around the dog's collar.  The device comes with two bands and even with the Lab, we needed to use the small band.  Note:  I do worry that this is not going to last over time and hopefully, this is something that will be improved upon.  I can see looking for on an acre of land.  After that, set up your profile, pair the device and tah dah, you are ready to begin tracking activities!  We first tested the device with some simple running back and forth with the ball. Once the dog came within the distance of my phone, I was able to see his activity. (Think about this!  You have hired a dog walker and you go away on vacation.  When you get home, you can see just how far you dog walked!)  Of course, you can add when your dog has been walked, pooped, peed, had medicine or even had a treat.  As an adult, I don't have much use for this function because I am usually the one feeding them.  I certainly will use it if I need to record this information for the vet during a time of illness, which does happen.  I think the absolute perfect person for the Hachiko Smart Dog Sensor is a child .  Not only will they love tracking their dogs activity, but you are also encouraging their own activity tracking!  Not only that, but people can take photos of their dog and save them in the app!  I would love to see this activity tracker take another step and have a camera! That would be so much fun!UPDATE:  Unfortunately, I feel I should I update this review.  Our dog's tracker was lost somewhere on our property last evening. I had a feeling that the thick rubber bands were not going to hold the tracker in place and I was right.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWEK0CZ3YTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EG0G48#wasThisHelpful","R2NWEK0CZ3YTA","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, these are awesome disposable cups!  The Hefty College Cups features college teams that we all love and are proud of!  They aren't as thick as the well known red cup, but these do the job well. There is no need to waste and have them thicker. The price point is great and makes for a fun conversation piece!

"It has been several years since I have worn Calvin Klein Eternity!  It wasn't because I didn't love it though!  I just couldn't fit it in the budget.  I am a mother of four. My usual attire is jeans and sneakers with a sweater, but there is something that feels good about adding a spray of Eternity to you!Highlights:1. Packaging - First impressions are lasting impressions! Nice box, bottle with a silver spray top2. Fragrance - LOVE IT!  One spray will do you, possibly two. (My 16 year old even loved it on me!)3. Long lasting. 12 hours later, there is a hint of Eternity still with me!4. Value - You get what you pay for.  Well worth the price point for the quantity.  Overall, I love the Calvin Klein Eternity!  It makes a great gift for yourself or someone special!  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews from so long ago, but in my personal opinion, this is the real deal. I have posted pictures below of what you will receive!  As you can see, it's quite tempting! I wish you could smell a picture!

"LeapFrog has been a trusted brand in our family for many years.  We have owned all of the LeapPad versions along the way and currently own the Platinum.  In addition, I consider us a tech savvy family that owns both iPad's, Fire Tablets and so much more.  For the little ones, I believe that internet safety is a priority and that we can and should find products that keep our children safe.  Highlights:~ Set up is a breeze (all wireless and battery comes somewhat charged so you can begin!)~ Built in rechargeable battery~ Huge app library with fun and educational games, books, videos and music! (Yes, Paw Patrol and Frozen are there too!)~ Sharp and clear graphics, fluid movement~ SAFE internet searching - with KID SAFE SEARCHES  I have so many highlights and there are more!  First impressions are lasting impressions!1.  Love the packaging and set up was a breeze. It comes with everything you need to begin enjoying your LeapFrog Epic right way!2. Your Epic will come preloaded with apps, but I purchased a few additional!  I purchased the $20 LeapFrog Digital Download Card at a discounted price here at Amazon ($13) and combined it with a LeapFrog coupon (30% off).  Here is the link to the download card! LeapFrog Digital Download Card3.  Easy to set up - even a place for 6 ""favorite"" apps or simply swipe and find the rest!4. My personal favorite was finding Scholastic Reader!  The little one's favorite was Jewel Train!  There are many fun and engaging games available on the new Epic. In many ways it is similar to the previous version, Platinum, but LeapFrog took it a step ahead and gave the kids what they wanted. They gave them the real feel of a tablet and the safety of their own internet access.  I have taken several pictures for your review! I hope you enjoy the Epic as much as we do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TR0AGCXAMAPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R3TR0AGCXAMAPJ","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the Lionel Polar Express Imagineering Train Set!  I wanted to ""love"" it because we are huge Geotrax and Polar Express fans in our house!  I think if the price point were lower or if a few extra pieces of track were included, I could definitely see myself loving this toy. The kids, 3 and 5 love it!Highlights:~ Easy to put together and sturdy!~ Easy coupling of trains~ Fun imaginative play with the Polar Express and Christmas!BONUS FUN:  This track also supports the old Geotrax trains (SEE PICTURES!).  The track is not interchangeable with Geotrax.  Overall, the Lionel Polar Express Imagineering is a kid powered train set that opens the world of imagination and the freedom to expand with other Imagineering sets, such as John Deere, Crayola, Batman and more!  Expansion track is sold separately!  It is sturdy and fun.  Please note that 6 feet of track is included, but it is not a 6 foot layout.  The absolute only reason for 4 stars versus 5 is the price point for this particular set.  I would have liked to have seen more track come with it, even if only a couple extra straight pieces so more children could play at once.  I have taken several pictures for your review!  As you can see, I have taken pics of a couple of our Geotrax to show you how they work well on this track!  Nice set! Will certainly make a nice gift for your Polar Express fan!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5DMNWVKAEU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAVW6IY#wasThisHelpful","R3B5DMNWVKAEU4","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Melissa & Doug products, but I felt the  3-D Fanciful friends missed the mark. I tried this with a 7 year old and a 5 year old. The 7 year twisted the cap and ""snap"", that was the end of that pen. The whole blending part was a joke. She was very frustrated trying to fit the pieces together to created anything worthwhile. We ended up coloring the pieces and using them to create our own creation glued on paper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKI76LOG4RNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UV7N4G#wasThisHelpful","R3UKI76LOG4RNY","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, for price and play value, the Disney Junior Super Stretchy Game is a fun way to keep the little ones moving on those rainy/snowy blah days!  I have now pulled this out several times over the last week and each time I am greeted by squeals of delight!  The idea is the same as the adult version that we have all loved throughout the years, but this mat is scaled down to fit the smaller children. I played with a 3 and 5 year old and they both loved it.  How can you go wrong? Price point is great, play value, movement, educational value and all their favorite characters right there!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have liked to have seen a bit higher quality mat. I don't think I have room to complain at this price point though!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINLLYGM1KTO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQPOTPM#wasThisHelpful","RINLLYGM1KTO7","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the miWorld Dairy Queen Restaurant Starter Set as a gift for a 7 year old. She is very crafty. I was so happy to see her excitement at her birthday party when all the children ran forward to see this miniature surprise!  It comes as shown - walls, floor and accessories.  Please NOTE:  It does NOT come with a doll and that must be ordered separately.  It does fit several other dolls, so it wasn't a problem that our doll didn't arrive in time.  Each playset fits together. This particular 7 year old declared she wanted them ALL for Christmas so her Barbie family could have places to shop!  As you can see by the picture below, we had no issues at all with the sturdiness of the item, but keep in mind, she is 7.  You may have different results if you give this to a younger child.  The only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of 5 star is because ""Starter Set"" to me implies that you have everything you need to begin playing with miWorld.  It does not come with a doll, so really, it's not a ""starter"" set, but an ""add on"" set.  Perhaps that is just semantics, but if you are giving this as a gift, I think it's important to know if the child will have a doll that size on hand to play with their new miWorld. Personally, I would rather pay a few dollars more and have it all inclusive than be charged more for a doll.  Overall, it is a great set and I do highly recommend it!  You can also download the app and play the game!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23UOJP1EPKC85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFZXQUE#wasThisHelpful","R23UOJP1EPKC85","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love, love, love this set!  Although the manufacturer recommended this for children 4 and up, a 3 year old has done just fine with it!  It is the typical Hot Wheels quality that we have all learned to love as a trusted brand over the years!  It comes with not one, not two, but THREE Monster Jam trucks!  It is very easy to assemble, it does not require batteries and most of all, it does what it says it does!  Here is the bonus!  Do you love Blaze and the Monster Machines?  This particular Blaze works with this set!  It is not a Hot Wheels, but it's a definite perk to owning both!  Here is the link for it:  Fisher-Price Nickelodeon Blaze and the Monster Machines Blaze  I couldn't believe it worked  See the pictures below! It's a photo journey from the beginning!  The trucks that were captured in the Dragon's mouth were sent there by a 3 year old!

There is always a fight over who gets the Milk Chocolate and who gets the Dark Chocolate, but I have to admit, both are very good.  The Dark Chocolate is not bitter at all, but yet mild and smooth!  All in all, a great tin to have on hand and refill when you have guests!  Makes a great gift to give this holiday season as well!  It's not wimpy in size at all!  I had to hold it in two hands!

"Blaze and the Monster Machines are much loved in our house.  I purchased Blaze several weeks ago and he has been much loved, used and abused since then.  3-5 year old boys can play rough, but Blaze has held up really well!  I am very happy to have a second one so they can each have one now!  NOTE:  As you can see, the listing has been corrected to reflect the correct size. It's the same size a nice chunky Monster Truck would be - approx. 3"".  So when you read the negative reviews, you might want to take that into account.  Blaze has bold and vibrant colors and he has brought much life to our collection of cars and trucks.  I would absolutely love a track built for Blaze and I hope that Fisher-Price comes out with one real soon!  Solid 5 stars - quality, price and a much loved friend!Edit:  Please note that we just tried Blaze in the Monster Jam Dragon play set and it worked!  See my pics there as well as he drives on the track and jumps through the Dragon's mouth!

"We are always in need of extra surge protectors in our house. How do they just walk away?  I liked the idea of having a compact surge protector - less bulky and nice short cord. Absolutely perfect for my desk. Great in concept, but execution a bit flawed.  As with most surge protector, the Woods 6-outlet surge protector didn't really allow me to use all six. I managed to get my laptop, printer and lamp plugged in and that was about it.  I have taken a picture to show you just how close the outlets are to each other.  In some ways, this is my own fault for not realizing this ""compact"" size would take away from my use.  However, don't call it a 6-outlet Surge Protector if you can't use all 6. The outlets are tight, so be prepared to muscle them in.  For today, this will be fine.  I will have to keep looking for find a new use for this one.  I was hoping to mount it behind my desk so I didn't have to look at the wires, but I don't think I can do that now.  It does have the capability for mounting though!  If you only need a few outlets and love the compact nature, this would be a good choice for you!

"For several years, I have wanted a pump for our giant bottle of mouthwash.  Of course, it is less expensive to buy the larger bottles, but who really wants to look at them on your vanity?  It always seemed like someone was spilling, dripping or using an excessive amount. Living in a family of 6, you notice these things.  The OXO Good Grips Pump Mouthwash Dispenser is awesome! I love it and ask that you take a look at my pictures!  Very easy to use. Simply unscrew the top, pour your mouthwash in and it is ready to go.  Push down on the top and you can dispense as much or as little as you would like. Pour into your own disposable cup or with the included plastic cup.  Of course, you can use it right from the canister if you like as well!  Not only was I pleased with the flawless design, but I thought of our many seniors that have difficulty lifting heavy bottles. What a perfect gift for them.  Even for my husband that has limited use of one hand, this is great!  No more trying to grasp that bottle!  I have only been using it a few days and have only positive things to say!

He wears a large in American Eagle hoody's for comparison purposes.  The color is a sharp and deep black with the vibrant white small logo.  I had fully intended to give it to him for Christmas, but when it arrived, I couldn't help but give it to him. He put it on immediately and hasn't taken it off since!

"We have an enormous collection of Playskool Heroes Transformers Rescue Bots. We have been huge fans for a couple of years now.  I have to admit, until this particular play set, all have been a solid 5 star rating. Let me show you some pictures and let you know just what you are getting!  Yes, this does have to be assembled. It's just click and pop into place with easy to follow directions. Most of it does stay together once you firmly click it into place.  However, there will be times when a little one detaches a portion of it. It's not a solid structure like some of the other play sets that have been released.  The bot that is included is also not of the same quality as one of the other Rescue Bots you might own, he is lighter plastic, but loved nonetheless.  I think if you give it to a 3 year old, they will detach parts of it more than if you give it to a 4 or 5 year old. That's our experience anyway.  The 5 year old never has an issue. The 3 year old apparently uses a bit too much muscle!  The highlights for us were the working crane, the bot and the imaginative play value. I love that the ship has different areas for both play and storage.  What don't I like?  I knew you would ask!  Well, I am not a fan of cardboard cutouts at this price point.  For pennies more, two small figures could have and should have been included. I think then I would be able to say that this was a great price point.  Maybe Playskool will make them available someday. So far, they are hard to find in our area.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBZ6GIS4YX68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOVMXW4#wasThisHelpful","RVBZ6GIS4YX68","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been proud owners of Fire products for many years. They have all passed the test of durability and dependability!  What a great price point!  You absolutely will not be disappointed!  When you first receive your Fire Tablet, you will need to update your software.  It will come with some battery life, so you are fine to do it right away, but plug it in to be sure.  This way, you will be ready to play!  Prior to my tablets arriving, I set up four profile accounts in my Amazon account for the kids. When I set this up, the profiles were right there and available for me to choose! So easy for each family member to have their own profile!  Next came, the test of speed!  Was this going to perform? Would we be able to watch a movie for real?  I added my apps and began to play Monsters Inc.  The clarity was great and the speed was flawless.  Of course, it is an additional bonus that I can save my extra movies and apps up in the Cloud and not have them all on the device at once if I don't want to.  In addition, one of the perks of Amazon Prime means that I can download movies and send them up to the Cloud when we don't need them on the device!  How about game playing?  My husband didn't skip a beat on his favorite games! I picked it up to play Candy Crush and it worked great!  I thought that for the price we might be getting an inferior product, but no, we did not!  I love the Amazon Tablet! What a great way to share the love. I purchased 6.

It's a great way to try each product decide for yourself if it is something that works for your baby's skin.  My only complaint is a small one, but I will mention it because I feel I should.  I don't like the advertising that it comes in a ""Keepsake Photo Box"".  My box arrived ripped, so it really isn't sturdy enough to be a Keepsake Box.  Nice idea, but flawed in execution. You would need a sturdier box or even a tin for it to be of any value in that regard.  The other point to make is that teeny weeny bar of soap.  It's definitely adorable, but it is small.

"The RoseArt Color KaBoom Airbrush art set is a fun in concept, but it does fall short on execution.  You will need 4 C batteries to start so be sure you have them on hand! Let's begin with what's in the box!In the box:•Motorized Airbrush (YOU will need to supply (4) C batteries)•10 Kaboom Sticks•5 Stencil sheets•20 Sheets of black paper•2 Art boards•2 Cords to hang your artwork  I am hoping that our experience is not everyone's experience, but we had a slight mess and the fun was short lived.  I worked with both a 16 and 6 year old on this one, just to give you an idea of what age group it is right for.  The 6 year old lost interest after the first blast of color and was more interested in trying to use the sprayer when he found the minimal color that was actually spraying. Again, that is probably just that age boy thing. An 8-11 year girl may be the perfect match for this art set.  The 16 year old created a background, let it dry and then went over it with another color with their name.  So again, there is a right age for this product, it just isn't 6 - not in our house anyway.  I was curious about refills because this will get some use by the 16 year old, but I was not able to find them here on Amazon.  I have to say that for the price point, if this is a one and done type item - it's way too expensive. Refills should be readily available.  I regret not being able to give set a better rating. 1. It uses a lot of battery life  2. It isn't meant for the target age group of 6+  I would not let a 6 year old by use this by themselves, unless you want their parents very annoyed at you. ;-)  3. Refills are not available at the stores I checked. Not even here at Amazon.  Thus making the price point way too high for what you get.  Great concept, but failed in execution.  Would love to see this improved upon!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZGELE17GXMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAQ417M#wasThisHelpful","R1KZGELE17GXMU","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th Max Tow Truck Mini Hauler that I have purchased here at Amazon.  I have paid between $3.75 and $6 for each of them. We love them.  They are friction powered and have magnets in them. They go UP the refrigerator, across the floor or right on the red magnetic track that it comes with.  We find them to be well made and both the 3 and 5 year old haven't managed to destroy one yet.  I see they now sell a track pack and I've just ordered that as well. It comes with a suction cup, so the kids can really have fun racing their Max Tow Truck Mini Haulers up a hill!  I highly recommend these!  Great stocking stuffer or start your own car collection as we have!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0V3DJQQ4ZUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNNCOI2#wasThisHelpful","RZ0V3DJQQ4ZUH","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I had high hopes for the Hefty Ultimate Easy Grip Plastic Cups, but I was left disappointed in the product. Overall, they are a nice size and have a vibrant color.  I have taken several pictures for your review. One is to show you size comparison and then a series of pictures to show you that they just aren't that sturdy. My son poured apple cider into one, picked it up and it spilled. He wasn't expecting the sides to just cave in with his grip. It's not like he is the Hulk or anything.  The grip would be a nice feature if the plastic were sturdy. I know I am use to the other leading brand (the red cup!), but this product feels inferior and reminds me of a wannabe.  I would love everything about the cup if the walls were sturdier.

"We are really enjoying the RoseArt Roto-Motion Mixer Dino Lab!  Finally, a toy that does what it says it does and is of decent quality!  Please see all my pictures below!  NOTE:  *I* overfilled the dino mold by a little bit and thus the reason for all the splatter. Clean up was incredibly easy and just wiped away!First, what's in the box and is it hard to assemble?  In the box you will find your laboratory to create dinosaurs, 3 different molds, tools for stirring, special plaster mix and paint set to paint your dinosaur!How long does it take and how easy is it?  Easy enough to do with a 3 year old by himself.  The 5 year old was able to do it alone.  We had the three year old counting to 60 while he turned the crank!  Fun and easy to do!  Start to finish...a total of 20 minutes tops. 15 of those minutes is drying time.  Add the water, add the mix, pour it into the mold, turn the crank! Easy as 1-2-3 !Overall, this has been a lot of fun and I am so looking forward to making more!  Many times you get craft kits or toys that are a total flop. This actually makes plaster dinosaurs!  I have opted to show you pictures from our first attempt so you can see just how easy it is. Please note that last picture was taken before that one was painted!  Woops.

You can't beat this $3.75 price point, but if it were double the price, I would still buy it!  High quality! Fun! Durable enough for the play of both the 3 and 5 year old!

"We are definite Thomas fans in this house and we love the quality of Fisher-Price products. Put the two together and you have a solid winning brand.  The Fisher-Price Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Musical Melody Tracks Set is a quality train set that is very well made.  Please see the pictures I have taken to get a close up look!Please note: Yes, the wooden track is compatible with other brands that we have in the house.  Your set comes with everything you need to have a Thomas adventure right out of the box with no batteries needed. It comes with Thomas, a cargo car, cargo, etc.  The set up is very easy and of solid quality. It is a thin layout and will easily fit on your train table or on the floor like we have done.  The music is the xylophone attached to the bridge.  I expected a set that played music similar to the theme song. However, it is just a xylophone and unless your imagination is working for you, it does not remind me of the Thomas theme song at all.  The kids didn't recognize the sound as the theme song either.  They are 3 and 5 years old.  They are perfectly happy with the sounds though!  Overall, it is a really nice set that your children will love. If you don't have expectations of music that plays the Thomas theme song, you are fine.  If you content with xylophone sounds, which is perfectly fine, you will be pleased. I can picture a young toddler really enjoying this set.  We are enjoying the set very much, but I think the advertising needs to be tweaked just a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH70S5FN0UQGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO7ICZQ#wasThisHelpful","RH70S5FN0UQGV","A1GNYV0RA0EQSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GNYV0RA0EQSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me begin by telling you that I normally use Lancme products and I have medium skin (not oily/not dry).  I like my day lotion to have an SPF to help protect me from the sun's harmful rays. In addition, I believe that Burt's Bees is a trusted brand and I have used many of their products over the years.  They say that first impressions are lasting impressions.  I was immediately impressed with the packaging - a glass pump bottle enclosed in a nice box.  Please see the pictures below!  Let's put the product to the test !  I immediately pumped a bit out to see how ""thick"" it was. I was very pleased to see that it was much lighter and thinner than my normal product. (See picture below).  The fragrance was light. I honestly don't need any fragrance in my day cream, but this is  light and doesn't bowl you over!  Application was smooth and easy. A little goes a long way!  It didn't feel greasy or heavy.  You noticed almost immediately that your skin was hydrated and smooth.Highlights:~ Nice packaging - glass pump bottle in a box~ Pleasant light fragrance~ Not heavy, but light and easy to apply (Remember: a little goes a long way!)~ SPF 30 to help protect you from the sun's harmful raysOverall, I am very pleased with the quality of the product, the price point and the overall execution.  Time will tell if it does what it says it does. I am only at the beginning of my 87 day journey to see if the fine lines/wrinkles begin to disappear!  I will certainly update!

I selected the 16x20 w/the black frame. I thought the black frame with the white matting would bring out more color and it did! See my pic below!  The frame is a decent quality and it does come with the sawtooth hanger on the back. It's not your art boutique quality frame, but I didn't want to spend $300 either. I thought the price point was fair and I am incredibly pleased with the quick delivery!  For the price point, the quality and print are definitely worth it.

"Like many of us, we need a bit of organization when the tots are in the car. I'm sorry, but the last thing I want is a tablet flying across the car or getting dropped.  The Carbors Backseat Organizer for Tablets is a great solution.  I have a Honda Pilot and as you can see in the pictures, it fits just fine. It has an easy clip that adjusts around your headrest and two ties that fit through the seat at the bottom. We ultimately opted not to use the bottom ties because we wanted it easy in/easy out. We don't always travel with a tablet.  The tablet area is roomy enough to fit an iPad Air with a Smart Cover on it. We also tossed in a Kindle Fire and a LeapPad and all fit just fine - one at a time, of course!  There are handy mesh pockets if you want to allow your child a space for small toys, crayons or even snacks.  The price point is a bit high, but overall, it does what it says it does!

Dove is a trusted brand in our house, so I was pleased to try yet another one of their products. We own several Dove products because they were originally recommended by the dermatologist many years ago. The fragrance is pleasant and it applies like any other shampoo.

"I have to admit, I was skeptical. The one thing you don't mess with in our house is toilet paper. I grew up with Scott for how many years? When I married my husband, he was a Cottonelle user.  We probably should have switched brands all together, but this was not even worth an argument. So I switched and will sometimes buy both!  Now we have added a third brand to the competition - Charmin Ultra Strong Toilet Paper - Mega Roll.First Impressions:  My first observation (and complaint)  is that the Mega Rolls do not fit in our recessed toilet paper holders very well at all. They are a tight squeeze and you end up finding little pieces of toilet paper on the floor from the kids trying to get the roll started. I do like that there is more...but...  My second observation is that the Charmin was thinner than our current brand, which to me, means you need to use more to get the job done.The Test:  ~ No complaints by any family member! (Win! Win! If my husband doesn't complain, we are gold!)  ~ Strong, but soft - I did feel as though you needed more to accomplish the same task, so I'm not sure that ""more"" is helpful.  ~ See pictures below!Overall, I found the quality of Charmin Ultra Strong Toilet Paper to be decent! I wasn't disappointed as I thought I might be.  It does have a few shortcomings for our household, but that doesn't mean it won't be right for you. The price point is right in there with the rest, so this is up to personal preference.  I would definitely add this as a 3rd option when shopping for our house.

"Dr. Marcum sheds a much needed spotlight on the growing problem of the misuse of pharmaceuticals in medical practice today that often result in death or a worsening of the patient's condition. Too many individuals have been sold on prescription medicine as a wonderful panacea that excuses them from any responsibility in their healing. Marcum calls for every individual to take personal responsibility in knowing exactly what kind of medications they are putting into their bodies, the risks, side effects and the alternatives, rather than blindly taking medications they know nothing about. The educated medical patient is the one, Marcum insists, who greatly lowers the risk of harm or even death when taking prescription medications, and he backs up his claims with countless examples of how medicines can kill when used wrongly or without exercising caution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YC3CKR08DXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414368852#wasThisHelpful","R21YC3CKR08DXD","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Bit 360 is an all-inclusive screwdriver unit that features six different bits, all of which can be changed without your having to manually insert the bit into the screwdriver head. You can change the bit size quickly and easily simply by twisting the bit compartment and then locking the new bit into place. There is no more searching through a messby toolbox to find bit heads or another screwdriver, and this easy to operate screwdriver is great for individuals who tend to be all thumbs or who have arthritis in their hands and fingers and lack the manual dexterity to change from one bit to another. The screwdriver feels solid in your hand while you are using it, and the rubberized grip prevents your hand from slipping. Bit 360 also allows you to load bits you already own into the chamber, as long as the bit is longer than 1"" 1/8 inch.

"With adult coloring books all the rage now, ""Don't Quit Your Day Dream"" is a sophisticated entry into that creative category. The 20 tear-out cards included in this book each contain an inspirational thought or illustration, ready for you to get to work with crayon, colored ink or colored pencils to make an original masterpiece. The back of each card has a frame surrounding blank space, which could be utilized to send your completed creation as a post card (with appropriate postage, of course!).

"This gadget is a great way to be able to enjoy scrambled eggs with your choice of add-ons, such as chopped veggies, ham or cheese, in less than two minutes! This unit is easy to use and clean, but extreme care must be taken because the ceramic heats up very quickly and stays hot, so take extreme care when taking the Egg-Tastic out of the microwave when cooking has completed. Have two hot pads or a pair of heat-resistant gloves on hand. For the best results, read over the safeguards and instructions that come with this unit, such as using eggs at room temperature and blending the eggs with a fork prior to cooking. The unit will cook up to 4 eggs at one time, enough for two hearty appetites or four smaller ones. Pay attention as well to the suggested cooking times on the enclosed cooking guide, depending on the power of your microwave oven. We are fans of eggs for breakfast and brunch and were delighted to receive Egg-Tastic free of charge in exchange for our honest, unbiased opinion in this review.

"Having nicely manicured hands can get pretty expensive pretty quickly if done by a professional manicurist.

We received the Roto Clipper at no charge and with no fee in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and we're happy to report this is one beauty care aid you'll want to find in your Christmas stocking this year. It fits nicely into the palm of your hand, is easy to maneuver as you guide each nail around the rotating blade for a nice smooth file or trim job and is small enough to easily store in your purse or beauty supply cabinet. We especially like that the blade comes with a protective cover when the unit is not in use and the built-in light makes it easy to see what you are doing. Roto Clipper even comes with a brush so you can clean the blade and keep it in good working order longer.

Constant anxiety and depression are just some of the results, with people having more choices and resources than ever, yet remaining the unhappiest generation. You will definitely start seeing the world around you much differently after reading The Perfection Deception. Bluestein offers some concrete ways to escape this trap in order to become what she calls your ""biggest, baddest self.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241W3X6BZ8CNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0757318258#wasThisHelpful","R241W3X6BZ8CNL","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Think Board is a great way to inspire children of all ages to be creative. It installs easily, is fun to use, and wipes clean with a dry paper towel for re-use again and again. This is the smallest of 3 sizes and we like the fact that it fits in a compact space. Use it to post reminders, work out math problems or to post messages. We also like the fact that it encourages kids to write out things by hand rather than use a technological device. A great gift for any boy or girl, son or daughter returning back to the classroom this fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NILNYHVREQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012U6NE22#wasThisHelpful","R29NILNYHVREQD","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading the wonderful insights and suggestions in this book is like having someone hold your hand in the darkness, assuring you that a light will come on at some point once again to light your path. Author Tako does an excellent job of balancing her own unique journey after her breast cancer diagnosis, which she calls her ""personal 9/11"" , with the acknowledgement that the reader's journey and experiences may be similar but also just as unique. Her warm, candid, conversational tone draws the reader in to a safe and comfortable place during a time when everything seems pretty scary. If you can't be there in person to help someone who has been diagnosed with cancer, this book will help hold their hand and give them some resources they may not have considered to help them through a life-changing experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231PSYYPB7O66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782797750#wasThisHelpful","R231PSYYPB7O66","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vanessa Chamberlin really has a knack for making every member of the family actually get excited about changing food and dietary choices for a happier, healthier life. Her enthusiasm for the Plantfire lifestyle is contagious and the abundance of fresh produce-rich recipes featured in this book are gourmet gorgeous and much better for your body than most traditional ingredients found in today's supermarket. We especially like her section about how to set up a Plantfire kitchen, listing the key herbs, spices and other ingredients designed to make your dishes more appetizing and appealing.

"We initially expected this book to be about Captain Van Kleeff's adventures as an American Airlines pilot, but it is a more comprehensive view of his entire career, including the influences of his childhood and his experiences during the Vietnam War. Van Kleef is an engaging story teller and the reader feels as though he's talking to a good friend while at the local tavern nursing a cold beer.  Van Kleef doesn't pull any punches describing the victories, failures, romances and risks he's taken, both as a private and commercial pilot. His experiences while flying the skies above Saudi Arabia are especially entertaining. The story of his life, his choices and his adventures are well worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R126369S2AOSSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149903508X#wasThisHelpful","R126369S2AOSSJ","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can tighten or loosen the belt in just seconds. This is a versatile and stylish belt that can easily be worn with jeans, or to create a waistline when wearing an oversized top.

"This is a very well constructed case for securely storing a week's worth of medications or vitamin supplements. We love the green and pink color motif since it reminds us of the legendary Beverly Hills Hotel, surely one of the icons of great style. The compartments in the removable inner case open and shut easily and in each day's compartment you can fit 4-5 small pills or up 2 large gel capsules. The Style Rx looks so much prettier sitting at the table or on your bedroom dresser than a pill bottle and it is easily transported in pocket, luggage or purse.

The remainder of this book features more than 100 recipes designed to provide good nutrition and variety for the diabetic patient, from breakfast through evening dessert. Most of the recipes, including such specialties as Turkey and Orzo Stuffed Peppers, Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla and Asian Lettuce Cups are designed to curb carbs, fill up on fiber and favor healthy fats, all of which are very beneficial in defeating the negative effects of diabetes.All of the recipes make liberal use of seasonal fruits and vegetables and other fresh foodstuffs and are delicious enough for the diabetic cook to share with the entire family.

"This is a great way to keep your medications and daily vitamin supplements organized, in addition to reminding you to not forget to take your pills. Each day's ""compartment"" features four separate compartments capable of holding up to six small pills or three gel caps. Since we are using it for daily vitamin supplements, we disregard the morning/noon/afternoon/nighttime designations and just fill the compartments to use every morning. The clock, which features a light, is also a handy feature to note the time and day, in addition to setting it with either an alarm or a voice reminder to take a specific dosage at an appointed time. MedCenter answers the question - ""did I take my pills"" today - to ensure that you don't forget and that you also don't take a double dose because you turn each day's container from the green to the red side when you have taken your pills.But you must be willing to take the time to open up each compartment within the day's container and fill it in order for this system to work - but once you get the hang of opening up each compartment, it becomes easy and after about 20-30 minutes investment of your time, your organizer is filled for the month and you never have to go searching for your pills or have a variety of bottles strewn around the table. We found some of the compartment lids a little stiff, but with practice you get the hang of it, but this may pose an initial problem if you have arthritis. When we asked the company specific questions about our unit, they were quick to respond and are customer friendly. Although this organizer was designed with seniors in mind, it is really a very helpful device for individuals of all ages who take daily vitamins, medications or both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68MICZ36FPJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RZPL0M#wasThisHelpful","R68MICZ36FPJP","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Characters and plot line are well developed, with plenty of suspense to hold the reader's attention, and the heroine Jacaranda is very likable.

Her exercise routine is also among the best we found for staying limber and eliminating those aches and pains. There are a few recipes sprinkled throughout one chapter - only wish there were more. But overall, Positive Moves is like sitting down over tea with a warm and generous friend eager to help you live life to the fullest on a daily basis!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29SKETRZ4EAGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385302231#wasThisHelpful","R29SKETRZ4EAGL","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PCH Films has done a brilliant job of examining the heartbreak and challenge of Alzheimer's disease in this poignant remembrance of Glen Campbell's musical talent, as seen through the eyes of his spouse, children, musical associates, friends as well as Campbell's own observations. Very heartfelt and engaging interviews, without being sentimental or maudlin. This is a documentary that is must-see viewing, whether or not you are a fan of Glen Campbell, because it shines a spotlight on one of the biggest health crises facing all of us in the 21st century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMFPVTID1G7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XAWJ47K#wasThisHelpful","R2LMFPVTID1G7J","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cookbook deserves to be on everyone's kitchen shelf. It's a fun read in and of itself, with contributions from many of the stars of the golden age of silver screen and television. The recipes also tend to be featured because they are affordable and relatively easy to make,  can often be made ahead of time to serve later, and are crowd pleasers.

"This comprehensive volume will appeal primarily to the hardcore vegan, since most all of the recipes are very detailed and use a multitude of ingredients, many of which are likely to be specialty items for regular kitchens. These are serious vegan recipes rather than 1-2-3 quick cooking.  We are amazed at how author McNish has managed to turn traditional recipes upside down and inside out to present creative twists that capitalize on the use of fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices. How about a borscht soup that uses quinoa and lentils as a complement to red beets? Or burgers made from quinoa and sweet potatoes, or snack chips created using cashews, kale and bell peppers rather than potatoes? Even if you just decide to observe meatless Mondays and are in need of inspiration, Vegan Everyday gives you more than one new recipe per day to try without repeating the same recipe once throughout the year!  With the popularity and selection at local farmer's markets growing, this is one cookbook that will  help you learn how to enjoy previously unfamiliar foodstuffs in delicious, healthful, nutritious colorful dishes without spending a penny for beef, poultry or chicken!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GO6FWXDJ88E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778804992#wasThisHelpful","R12GO6FWXDJ88E","A24JK26NSBU48A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24JK26NSBU48A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Authors Nutt and Mercer provide the reader with a user-friendly, comprehensive guide to skillfully drying and preserving almost any category of food, from fruits and vegetables to beef, seafood and poultry.

"I just recently moved from a small apartment to a much bigger house. I was using a swiffer to clean up the floors but having to go back a lot to scrub the floors where it was still dirty. Part of my agreement of moving in earlier was cleaning and previous owners had a bird which they let poop all over the kitchen/dining area. I was skeptical that this mop could clean it up; it was quite disgusting and had been sitting for who knows how long. Anyhow, with some pledge floor cleaner and a little elbow grease it came up. This is an amazing mop system, it can pivot under furniture so I don't have to bend which is great for my bad back.The mop head is designed that it can be rotated freely through 360 degrees to evenly and easily clean any corner. The hurricane mop gets hair, dirt & dusts so you don't have to sweep, bend over or touch a dirty mop again! This unique mop and bucket come with micro-fibers used in the mop head resist wear, fight bacteria and clean without scratching floors or delicate surfaces. Special micro fiber material absorbs 10x its own weight & leaves no streaks or smears: it does what it says it does!

"This was a fun, like doing a science experiment. I did this with my niece over the summer. I carefully read the included instructions a few times before I even began to make sure I had everything I needed beforehand. I used a mason jar as my glass jar as described what was needed. I measured out my hot water and we had fun taking turns stirring it up. It seemed like it took a while, but I was determined to have it all mixed up. Then, came the waiting game. It stated that it takes 3-5 days to see results and the longer the better and it would continue to grow even after the allotted time.In the package, you will find a small piece of real stone. We had amethyst which is a pretty purple color and I chose this particular one because it is my neices birthstone. It also comes with a small magnifying glass to look art things more closely.  Kit contains crystal growing powder, seed rock, stir stick, and simple instructions. Included is an activity book and fun facts  for young ones to learn about the stone.This was really fun creating, watching it grow, and learning about amethyst.

"This is a nice sized nursing cover comes  and is made up of 100% cotton. It really doesn't matter what size the mother is, it is basically universally sized. It is a stylish and discreet way to breastfeed in public.  It can be used as a nursing cover, a blanket, or even as a sunshade to protect baby's fragile skin from harmful UV rays. It has a stiffening material at the top edge holds the fabric several inches off your chest. This lets you look down and see your baby, and for your baby to look up and see you, while still providing complete privacy.I recommend this; nursing covers allow mothers everywhere to feed their babies in comfort, style, and confidence anytime, any place!

Not so.  It was just dry skin.I slobber this lotion all over myself in the shower, not worrying about slippery greasy hands.  This is a lot more effective than the body creams that don’t seem to penetrate very well.  (I’m looking at you Bath and Body Works!)  Plus, the body creams are more difficult to wash off hands.

It could be he is just trying to ditch the terrible thrower and then relents when he realizes I am his best bet.My dog disliked the flavor of these supplements.

"I love a lot of the new devices that have come out for iPads and iPhones.  This one I downloaded on an iPad as I don’t want to mess around with the tiny print on the iPhone in my kitchen.  (See my few words below on how much I hate the Apple store.)Many of the top latest recipes on my app were liquor involved, a lot of things I would never have thought of, like Orange maple Daiquiri or Strawberry mojito.  For some reason, the drinks were on top.  It took a bit of scrolling but there were a lot of interesting foods to make.  I found Healthy Peanut butter bars.  One of the ingredients was Medjool dates so I immediately requested a substitute ingredient and did not receive one.  It was very sad.  So onward and upward.The recipes on this app are just amazing.  Mini blueberry cobblers.  Basil butter.  Salsa fresca.  French toast.  (The secret ingredients seem to be butter and sugar.)  The recipes have stars and/or comments.  Most of the recipes seem to be from Drop Kitchen but I also saw some from Saveur and Spur of the Moments.To change to Ounces, go to the drop down menu (three flat lines) on the top left.  Scale.  Change to OZ.  Then go back to menu and it is back to g on the recipes.  So go back to drop down menu and find settings on the bottom.  Change weight to ounces.  YaY!If you find, as I did, that your scale does not work, there is a nice little help center in the same drop down menu, near the settings, that offers some common causes of the battery not working, like that you may not have removed the tab or it may have jarred in transit.  In my case there was not a tab, so it must have working in transit (assuming it actually works).  The battery is CR2477 3V by Panasonic.  Renata CR2477 are 5 for ~$20.  (Here.)  I found that Drop Customer service gets right back to you and offers a solution to the problem.  Excellent service.And here are my 102 words on the apple app store:  This store hates me.  It is always like a half an hour to log in to make a purchase and that includes an exchange of emails to get a password link because the password I ACTUALLY KNOW does not work.  Then I have to find the debit card and give it the information that the STORE ACTUALLY KNOWS.  Then I have to accept the new terms and conditions, which means I must be offended to the core of my being.  Then and only then, may I purchase a FREE APP.

"Even though I know the science on it is not reliable, I have taken Glucosamine Chondroitin supplements to try to help with my knee pain.  I have a knee injury from kickboxing that has been exacerbated by arthritis.  The last time I saw an orthopedic surgeon, he said it wasn’t terrible enough yet to require replacement AND he got the injured knee wrong.  He said to take glucosamine chondroitin (Now I am just showing off knowing how to spell it) and come back in a few years.  Whatever.This has an added twist to the normal Glucosamine Chondroitin adding MSM.  I don’t know what the MSM is, except some kind of anti-inflammatory.  I have been taking a Glucosamine chondroitin for over a year now, ever since I flunked out of Physical Therapy, and have been able to increase activities, including walking, ellipticalling, and going up and down stairs over the past year.  I did not notice that this brand had any different effect than the others I have tried.  But that it worked was OVER my skepticism.  To the best of my knowledge, Glucosamine chondroitin was developed for horses.  And in fact, a new horse mix, Regenex, has MSM in it.

"It is about two weeks before gun-hunting season starts in Michigan and this is just the perfect time for this cookbook.  I generally get tired of venison because we just end up grilling venison steaks and that just is not a good way to eat them.  Some of the recipes in this book  just sound fabulous:  Rack of venison with sorrel berries, ground cherries and sautéed cattail hearts (p 233) or Roasted venison saddle with wood garlic, crosnes and wild mushroom jus (220).  I was hoping for more venison recipes because people just don’t bring me caribou or bear.There is also a great section for Wild Boar.  We used to have wild pig fairly regularly on Maui but it was always prepared pretty much the same way.Some of the game bird recipes are fantastic.  I found a lot of the directions for game birds to be incredibly informative.  I have never especially liked game birds because of never knowing what the quality of the bird is going to be.  But it is clear in the descriptions that the flavor is dependent on how the hunter prepares the bird after killing.Hunting is a complicated issue.

They are leather though, so I expect them to loosen up.I don’t know how long lasting these are or what they will stand up to yet.  I do know Bogs to have a very good reputation.

"After spending more than a year backpacking across Asia, Nick Sunder finds himself in Pakistan and accused of murdering one of his traveling companions. Knowing that the police are more interested in a quick conviction than justice, he takes what he thinks will be the easiest out and bribes smugglers to get him out of the city and on a path into Indian-controlled Kashmir. Things go awry when Nick is stranded in hostile territory without identification, money, or an alternate plan until two Kashmir Muslims trekking home allow Nick to join them.What starts out as a formula misunderstood-foreigner-in-trouble story becomes something much deeper as it explores the unique geography and people in an area of the world few North Americans have experienced. There are vivid descriptions of the dangerous, unique, and beautiful terrain that makes up the section of Asia tucked under the western Himalayas down into Pakistan and India and characters that represent the wide variety of peoples and languages that populate the area in various states of conflict, harmony, religions, politics, and ways of looking at life. The events and trials he experiences on the way along with the insight he gains from conversations with his new friend, Ghulam, lead Nick to a better understanding of himself and his own life choices.There is also parallel story of two children from a small village in Kashmir and the very different choices and paths they take into adulthood as the villagers help the girl to become a doctor while the influence of foreign mullahs in a local madrassa convince the boy to become a violent mujahid. Their stories eventually intersect with Nick's journey with profound consequences for them all.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8OBHA5BB8PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416556192#wasThisHelpful","R1V8OBHA5BB8PY","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sister Valentine Driskill has returned to her home near Princeton, NJ, and is anxious to share some alarming information from her research in the Vatican Secret Archives with her brother, Ben. Her research has led her to the discovery of a trail of murders that can be traced back to associations made during the Occupation of Paris in World War II between priests assigned to the area and Nazi officers. Before she can meet with him, Val is murdered in a chapel on her family's estate.There are several layers of conspiracy and mystery woven throughout this book's thriller plot, including doses of history of the Vatican's intrigues dating back to medieval times.For mystery lovers, there is an elaborate one offered here to unwind along with the main characters, Ben Driskill and Sister Elizabeth, as they each take separate paths to track down the real people known to them only as code names, and to find the reasons that one of those on their list is killing each of the others in turn.For conspiracy lovers, there is a decades-old one that reaches out from the past that threatens to affect the election of a new pope as each of the leading candidates try to cover up past indiscretions by whatever means necessary.History, covert dealings, and papal politics all blend together to build a satisfying thriller and mystery. For those who are unfamiliar with the often nefarious and shockingly political goings-on of the historical Roman Catholic Church and Vatican, it could offer a revelation and an introduction to parts of history that might be explored further outside of the confines of this novel.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGC3CHYN0VXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553057286#wasThisHelpful","RAGC3CHYN0VXE","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a must-read for animal lovers, owners of rescue dogs, and anyone considering adopting a rescue dog.The number of dedicated people across the country who devote time, effort, and money to saving the lives of thousands of dogs that would otherwise be put to death in shelters who are described in this book are true heroes. Not only do they save the lives of these dogs, they help match them to new forever homes and temporary foster homes where they can be nursed back to health in order for them to eventually make it to their forever home. The amount of work involved in this is astounding from maintaining websites, vetting applications for prospective new owners, to going out and finding and choosing which dogs are considered to be adoptable and knowing that they can't save them all. The descriptions of the conditions of many of these shelters and neighborhoods are often appalling, and it is heartbreaking to read of the many dogs that cannot be saved.The author traveled along the long and unglamorous road that many of these dogs take from being rescued from shelters and streets in southern states to the eventual road trip to the mid-Atlantic states and beyond to their new families. The determination of the volunteer workers and the driver of the truck for ""Rescue Road Trips"" keep the flow of rescues going despite the foul weather, the apathy and sometimes hostility of public officials, and the tight budgets all for the big payoffs of ""Gotcha Days"" when the dogs are united with their adopting families.There is a list of organizations at the end of the book with contact information for those readers who would like to help these volunteers with their efforts to save more dogs and to help keep the ""Rescue Road Trips"" on the road.Recommended.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F0QCREW35MQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWMC5WY#wasThisHelpful","R2F0QCREW35MQS","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the title, one would be led to believe that this autobiography by one of the partners of a leading Swiss private bank would argue with solid examples of just why a banker's life would not be all about money.What the reader gets in the first half of the book is a disjointed catalog of how the bank was founded and his ancestors, remembrances of his youth and family, descriptions of his time as an undergraduate during World War II at Lehigh University, an apprenticeship in a New York bank, graduate study at New York University, and the financial side of the founding of Israel. There is also a lot of name-dropping throughout the text about the famous scientists and artists who visited his parents' home (his father was a physicist and his mother a sculptress). The name dropping continues throughout the book ranging from politicians to musicians to other prominent bankers. There is little about what a banker is actually doing all day, every day for his firm. It was a chore to plow through the first half.I strongly recommend that the author and publisher consider the addition of a glossary to the book if there is a second edition. Having definitions for much of the terminology that is used in regard to banking structure, policies, and accounting as a reference would have made much of the book more understandable and meaningful to us non-bankers.The second half of the book shifts to academia, music, art collecting, and more name-dropping. Near the end of the book, the inquiry into the Swiss ""dormant accounts"" that may have been held by victims of the Holocaust and the results of the extensive audit of Swiss banks is detailed. There is a concluding chapter where Baer outlines the current state of investment worldwide and what portion is controlled by the Swiss banking industry and a few predictions for future trends. I was disappointed that he did not cover or comment upon the changes that have taken place in the banking regulations that have removed much of the privacy protection from accounts, specifically when it comes to reporting to the US and other foreign governments for taxation purposes. The second half was much more readable than the first half.For something that is labeled an autobiography, I found the omissions to be puzzling. For most people, meeting one's future spouse and the birth of the resulting children are high points in a life. While there is a chapter dedicated to his wife, Ilse, it seems very sparse on details with even the birth of their children only mentioned in the context of a broken leg soon after the birth of their daughter to put the event in perspective as to time. Mrs. Baer does appear in other remembrances through the last half of the book, usually in the context of being a companion on various travels. The children are not even given that mention until they have reached adulthood and then only in passing when mentioning an in-law or the next generation of bankers. What becomes clear is that the author was a workaholic who had little to do with his family during their formative years.The conclusions I drew from the book was that yes, it is indeed all about money, for without it, the author would not have been able to attend the various universities, travel, acquire his collection of artists' works, nor be a supporting patron of the Zurich classical music scene. Yes, he had talents, but without the money from his family's business he would not have been able to have indulged his interests or gotten the same level of training to exercise those talents.Not recommended as a whole, but sections or chapters might be cherry-picked by a reader depending on the specific interest in a topic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7E5WULHREN84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825305470#wasThisHelpful","R7E5WULHREN84","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ex-cop turned small farmer Abby Mackenzie finds more than fresh pastries waiting for her when she stops by the local patisserie with a delivery of honey. Chef Jean-Louis Bonheur is lying dead on the floor and his usually pristine kitchen is in chaos. The local police chief is quick to close the case as a probable suicide, but Abby disagrees with his assessment. When Jean-Louis's brother Phillippe comes to town to claim his brother's body, he hires Abby to prove that the death was due to foul play, not suicide.This book is a nice blend of a cozy mystery to solve, police procedure and forensics, and enjoyable characters. Abby is a strong character as is her best friend, Kat who is still a member of the town's police force. A number of supporting characters were introduced, many local business owners, who I would expect to figure more prominently in future stories. And maybe in a future story we'll find out if there is a hidden joke in everyone always referring to Chief Bob Allen by his full name and title.Reading about the amount of work that Abby does to maintain and grow her farmette business while juggling her investigative assignment is both exhausting and inspiring for those of us who count gardening as a favorite pastime. The attention paid to details of police procedure and chain-of-evidence by a former professional law inforcement officer is a nice change from the many amateur detectives found in cozies and adds a touch of reality to the investigation. A careful reader can connect the dots from the clues to solve the mystery along with Abby and Kat.There are bits of farming wisdom from the ""Henny Penny Farmette Almanac"" at the beginning of each chapter and a recipe or other advice on beekeeping or gardening at the end of each chapter. The recipe for Maisey's Low-Country Bourbon Pecan Pie looks especially inviting.Recommended.

"Sheriff Lil Eller wakes up handcuffed in the trunk of an big, old car being driven along bumpy mountain roads. Questions arise immediately such as where is her deputy cat, Boris? And even more importantly who in Crazy would be crazy enough to kidnap a sheriff?I'm hooked on this series. It's got a nice balance of interesting recurring characters, a serious mystery, and the running sub-plot of the Littlepage-Eller feud with Lil in the middle of the two families. There is just enough of Boris to add some fun and to see the caring side of Lil without the presence of the cat taking over or saving the day too often. It's not sweet or syrupy as are many other cozies with an animal sidekick, but it does contain some humor thanks to the quirky characters that inhabit the town and surrounding area.This mystery is different in that it has Lil as the victim and placed in the unusual position of having to survive, wait, and allow others to do the investigating and the saving. There are plenty of twists and surprises to follow along the way to figure out both the complex reasons behind the why of the kidnapping and the who that set it all in motion.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C3LVMJ9ILY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1494310341#wasThisHelpful","R16C3LVMJ9ILY7","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cy and Lou may be retired, but their successful career in homicide detective work isn't over yet when they're asked to investigate a probable murder by a sheriff in another county. As luck would have it, the victim, Col. Portwood, was a mystery writer they had met a few days earlier at the annual state book fair. Always ready to solve a new mystery, the boys get to work at unraveling the events leading up to the author's death.This book is back on track with a good, old-fashioned mystery to be solved. The series bounces back and forth between being heavy on running jokes about the detectives' lifestyles and the presentation of a well-thought out mystery. This one has some generous dashes of lifestyle humor, but delivers a tough solve-along mystery to the reader. I could have used more detail in the explanation for the motive which seemed a weak justification for murder.The characters introduced are distinct, varied, and believable. I only have one nit to pick about the brother and sister of the victim who came across as over-the-top dumb hicks and who don't seem to have come from the same universe as their brother much less the same family and upbringing. The point had already been made about their differences with their brother in the description of their home and their jobs without overdoing the poor grammar.Instead of the seemingly endless menus and food descriptions in earlier books of the series, we now get lists of authors and their mysteries that the main characters are reading which can quickly become just as tedious as the meals had become. Food has not been abandoned though since many restaurants that the boys visit are mentioned as though parts of the book have become a travel guide to Kentucky. The real mystery is what, if not bacon, is in Kentucky Bacon Pie?Recommended for cozy lovers who like humor mixed into their mystery. Oh, and watch out for Elmer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF21BV93WJ27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPFQK22#wasThisHelpful","R2BF21BV93WJ27","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection consists of two separate trilogies, each with its own form of nuclear destruction and the aftermath. The rating is an average for the six books included in the set.Radioactive Trilogy:The first trilogy begins in San Diego and centers around Jim Farr, an ex-Navy intelligence officer turned contractor specializing in marine mechanics.The first book in the trilogy, Radioactive Book 1, is the strongest of the boxset and on its own would rate four stars. The story is based around a dirty bomb being detonated on the San Diego naval base and the hero's escape from the city along with his cat and his co-worker to Phoenix to ensure the safety of his sister and her daughter. Farr is presented as someone who has prepared for emergencies, keeps his cool, and plans ahead, yet he never considered planning for an alternate route to Phoenix. Small inconsistencies such as this crop up at various spots of the book either as oversights or as plot devices. Overall it's a good page-turner of a thriller.The next two books of the trilogy don't measure up to the possibilities introduced in the first.Radioactive Book 2 - The City Burns is very short, but doesn't make much sense at all as a follow-up to the situation set up in the first book. Farr's brother-in-law, Matt, is being held and tortured for some unknown piece of information by persons unknown. Somewhere in all of this the line defining who are the good guys and who are the bad guys gets very blurred and confused. Oh, and there is a conspiracy too. The stars are falling as this segment of the trilogy falls to a stand-alone three stars.Radioactive Book 3 - The Resistance is all about special forces-style operations against the conspiracy. Somehow Farr has morphed from ex-Navy into a soldier without any explanation, along with his sidekick mechanic from the previous books. Not just any soldiers either, but the kind being sent into special ops situations complete with explosives and snipers. Other poor decisions by the people in charge of the anti-conspiracy forces cause the events in another plot in the book. What type of witness protection program gives out home addresses of the people they're supposed to be protecting? As in the other books, basic mistakes, oversights, and continuity problems such as this are in place simply as plot devices. The results are lots of heroics and action, but few answers about the conspiracy, the conspirators, or what the purposes or reasoning behind the conspiracy are forthcoming. This book rates only three stars.The Decay Trilogy:The second trilogy revolves around a series of terrorist attacks that include first a bombing of Wall Street which is then followed up by the detonation of several nuclear bombs in the eastern United States. One plot follows a family separated after the attacks and another follows a Polish tourist caught up in the attack on Wall Street by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The first book in this trilogy, The Decay, sets up the characters and the overall situation. Sacha, a Polish tourist, is in police custody after the Wall Street bombing simply because he was in the area, but once introduced is not heard from again in this first book. Paul Thompson and his step-daughter Julie are in Pennsylvania when one of the nuclear bombs goes off nearby and rush to get out of town and away from the radiation. Complicating matters is the fact that Paul's wife is on a business trip in Denver. They are determined to head west to try to find her and reunite their family.Paul is an unlikable character with a bad temper and seems to be determined to do one dumb thing after another by making a string of bad decisions. Julie, despite being only twelve years old, seems to be the smarter of the two. A sub-plot involving some thugs looking for Paul's employer has no good purpose to the overall plot and is never explained except as a device to give Paul a weapon before they begin their travels. The book gets a shaky two stars for taking a long way around to get not very far along with the story.The Decay: Episode Two, has Paul and Julie still in Pennsylvania and determined to get to Denver with the help of an ex-military officer, Jordan. Unfortunately Jordan is only moderately better than Paul in decision making. Overall this book is better than the first with the group finally making some progress towards their goal and the introduction of more characters from a gated community led by a man known as the Sheriff and a cult leader, Sister Bonnie, and her followers. Approximately three weeks after the attacks are covered as opposed to only one day in the first book, so there is much more happening as events move along. The character Sacha who was briefly introduced in the first book is not mentioned at all in the second book. This entry in the trilogy gets three stars.The Decay: Episode Three, rolls the time line back to re-introduce Sacha who is still in police custody as a terrorist suspect. The time line jumps back and forth between what has been happening to Sacha over the ensuing weeks and back to Paul and Julie as they make their way across country to Denver. We also finally meet Samantha, Paul's wife, and learn what she's been up to during the emergency. Toss in a new conspiracy, an underground bunker, a bunch of terrorists, and more poor decision-making by Paul and you've got the makings of a thriller. Unfortunately, the execution of the thriller is riddled with a lot of wildly improbable coincidences that go far beyond anything a reader should be expected to accept. We're down to two stars for this effort.Overall the boxset is not recommended, but if the first book of the Radioactive trilogy can be found as a stand-alone book, it is the one book from the collection that would be worth reading on its own. The rest of the collection can be skipped without fear of missing something important.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IX3ZU6X4BN0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EPH23U#wasThisHelpful","R1IX3ZU6X4BN0O","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been looking forward to reading this book of Pierre Trudeau's recollections of his life and his time in the office of Prime Minister of Canada and had great expectations of finding new insights into his career and the important events that shaped his tenure in office. I came away from reading it with a feeling that a lot was missing, not the least of which was the personal side of Trudeau's life with the exception of his early years before politics.The memoir itself was constructed from a series of oral interviews which were then back-filled with specific information and corrections of dates, places, and so forth by Trudeau and his aides. No doubt if this book had been written in the more typical way of most memoirs, with time to reflect and analyze the various events and to add the details that otherwise would be unknown outside of a select circle of participants, many of the important events mentioned would have been given more than a few sentences or paragraphs each. Other events that would have seemed important to an observer, such as his first meeting with the Queen after becoming prime minister, don't even rate a mention. The result is a rather impersonal cataloging of impressions of a select subset of people and events spanning his years in office.The major highlights of Trudeau's career are his handling of the FLQ terror attack in Quebec, the patriation of the Canadian constitution from Great Britain, and the creation of the Charter of Rights as part of that new constitution. Those events are covered more thoroughly than most others, although the constitutional fight is told more from the perspective of a political battlefront with the provinces and specific provincial premiers rather than about the elements of the constitution and Charter themselves.The book contains a wealth of photographs to illustrate the life of Canada's most famous politician, many coming from the private collection of the Trudeau family.Recommended for those interested in Canadian history and politics and those interested specifically in former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC34TU6JFRKHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771000367#wasThisHelpful","RC34TU6JFRKHO","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apartheid is still the rule of the day in the Republic of South Africa, and there is still a tension between the descendants of the Boer settlers and the English. The small town of Piemburg is a perfect example of this multi-leveled class structure. Police Kommandant van Heerden is an Afrikaner, but has long envied the English way of life, so when he is called to the estate of Miss Hazelstone after she calls in the report of a murder, he is beside himself with the thrill of finally getting to see inside Jacaranda House and be of service to the fine lady. When that fine lady confesses to being the murderer, van Heerden finds himself in the worst nightmare of his career.This book was originally released in 1971 and shows its age. At the time apartheid was still in force in South Africa and there was certainly a class system that carried over to the Afrikaners and English.Putting that history aside, the book still suffers from the basic fact that the author tried much too hard to be shocking rather than humorous. The humor rises only to the level of the mentality of twelve year old boys in that it is titillating and outrageously silly with many sexual references. Just as modern day comedians are finally wearing out the shock value of f-bombs and other similar language as substitutes for true humor, this book depends not so much on funny situations, humorous characters, and witty turns of phrase as it does on pulling one more shocker out of the bag of tricks. It may have shocked the readers in the 1970s and specifically the government of South Africa of the time, but now it just comes across as un-funny and rather sad since there was a potential for humor in the story of the incompetent police department personnel rather than with the repeated insertion of the salacious, sexual non-humor into the story which became tedious and embarrassing.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGVLPY37B67D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871131439#wasThisHelpful","R2OGVLPY37B67D","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Widowed with two sons to look after, Lady Elizabeth Grey approaches the new king, Edward IV of the York line of Plantagenets, to ensure that she and her boys will have their lands restored to them. Her request is a bold one since her husband had been killed while fighting for the Lancastrians against the York claim to the throne. Lady Grey gets more than she bargained for when the young king takes a fancy to her and eventually proposes a secret marriage.It took me a couple of tries before I could get into this book because the first few dozen pages read more like a romance novel than a serious work of accurate historical fiction. Initially, I found the first person narrative was difficult to accept since it was from the viewpoint of a real, historical person rather than a conveniently created fictional one simply observing the events or the usual technique of a third person narrative. Unless there is considerable contemporary documentation of the state of mind, motivations, and emotional state of the historical character, I shy away from the presumption of knowing what went on inside their heads. Once those hurdles were jumped, and I got used to the first person narrative, I was drawn into the intrigue and manipulations that saw power shift from one faction to the other and back over the coming decades.There were still some bumps in the book besides the romantic interludes. I found the sections dealing with the mythology behind the Melusina story became tedious and took the focus away from the main event, often at unwelcome times. Repeatedly revisiting the myth seemed even more out of place in a book that was otherwise well-grounded in fact rather than fancy.I appreciated the bibliography listing at the end of the book to assist in choosing further reading and study of the personalities and actions of the era. I hope that one of these can lead me to the historical basis for the sections of the book that suggested a changeling took the place of one of Edward's sons in the Tower of London while the real prince escaped to Flanders. This is the first suggestion I have come across in my reading on the subject that puts forward this alternate as a serious possibility.Recommended, but with the suggestion that readers with a low tolerance for fantasy may wish to skip the sections dealing with the Melusina myth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMCH34I0WKKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1410419304#wasThisHelpful","R2SMCH34I0WKKQ","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cookbook may look thinner than others on the subject, but it's packed with fabulous and authentic recipes for breads. Even if you've only managed to create basic breads or rolls so far, there is enough hand-holding information and illustrations of techniques to get you over your fears of shaping and proofing to produce these wonderful examples of classic breads.For beginners and intermediate bakers, there is an extensive section, ""Baking Essentials,"" explaining the various ingredients and tools that are used in bread baking. In the section ""Basic Techniques,"" the mechanics of mixing, proofing, kneading and illustrated and described in detail. Even experienced bakers can pick up some new tips and tricks for using starters and shaping techniques.I especially appreciated the photographs and step-by-step instructions for braiding and making twists and knots for specialty breads and rolls. The page showing the before-and-after results of various types of glazes that can be used on breads will help the home baker decide which is appropriate for their finished products and is a good reference to use for recipes other than those in this book.The recipes themselves go from basic breads using the bare minimum of basic ingredients all the way to enriched breads, flavored breads, quick breads, and breads for festive occasions that include fruit and nuts. There are many ethnic breads from which to choose including Pane Semola, Hungarian Potato Bread, Zopf, and Swedish Dill Bread to name a few. Several flat breads are included in addition to the more familiar leavened loaves.The ingredients lists are given in both American standard cup measurements and by metric weight for most items, except for small amounts listed in teaspoons and tablespoons.Some of the preparation instructions may seem to be a bit over the top and the more experienced bakers will probably make adjustments to the techniques to suit their style; however, less experienced bakers won't go wrong following the instructions in this book until they gain enough confidence in their own skills to make the changes that work for them.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T11KIOC4JZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789435136#wasThisHelpful","R25T11KIOC4JZ0","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deanna Durbin was a Hollywood star contemporary with Judy Garland, but unlike Garland, Durbin's movies featured classical music and operatic arias as well as light, popular tunes. This CD features a mix of a few classical selections and several popular songs her movies.The audio quality of the transfer is, unfortunately, not as good as the voice deserves. Several of these songs have not been available previously on Deanna Durbin collections, so it's a trade-off: either accept the noise, pops, and uneven audio levels from track-to-track or not have them at all. The worst example of this is the track ""Perhaps"" which is littered with background noises, presumably from the action in the movie soundtrack.There are no liner notes provided about the contents of the CD beyond a simple list of titles and timing. The composers and lyricists don't even rate a mention. At the very least, it would have been helpful to note the movie from which the track was taken and the year of release.Personally, I would have preferred the CD to be all classical pieces since the popular tunes have historically been easier to find while locating the classical ones is somewhat of a treasure hunt. I had been looking for the ""Russian Medley"" from my favorite of Durbin's movies, His Butler's Sister [VHS] and was thrilled that it is included on this disk. Luckily it is one of the better transfers and suffers less from the noise than do other songs, but does drop slightly in audio level from the previous track. ""None Shall Sleep Tonight"" (an English translation of Nessun Dorma) from the same film is wonderful.The popular tunes are an odd mix of what would be considered standards such as ""Night and Day"" and the wartime ""Say a Prayer for the Boys Over There"" and many lesser lights that have not stood the test of time. This version of ""Night and Day"" suffers from an oddly chosen arrangement that does not mesh well with Durbin's beautiful voice and includes a long added-in musical introduction that probably had more to do with the movie's story line than the popular song.Five stars for the voice, but the poor job of re-mastering has to pull the rating down to a mere four stars.Recommended for classical music mavens, old movie fans, and anyone wishing to listen to one of the best of Hollywood's singing leading ladies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0NVM5E8FMY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KZQ7HQ#wasThisHelpful","R3K0NVM5E8FMY5","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who would have thought that working as an intern at the National Endowment for the Arts could be hazardous to your health? Trent Norris finds out that his usually boring internship has become exactly that when he answers a telephone and takes a message with hidden meanings meant for one of the agency's bosses. One day and a dead congressman later, Trent finds himself sought by the law as the assassin. Using some unconventional tactics and the aid of an ex-engineer turned high-priced call girl, Trent tries to find the real killer and reason behind it and to clear his name while the death toll and list of charges against him grows ever longer.This book takes the basics of a plot for a serious conspiracy thriller and adds just the right touch of humor to take it out of the ordinary and make it fresh. Trent is presented as a likable guy who tries to do a decent job on his assignments and to be pleasant with his co-workers and bosses, all while keeping his head down and trying not to be bored to death, pretty much like most interns. The clever schemes he cooks up and the various risks he takes to dig up the dirt on the movers and shakers of several government agencies and contractors in order to prove himself innocent are entertaining without being too outlandish to be believable.The story is set just far enough back in time to make use of some old-fashioned technology as part of the plot. Those of us who remember the older computer systems, Wang word processors, and a time when there were pay phones on every corner will get a few flashbacks to those not-always-simpler times and a dose of nostalgia as a bonus.Recommended, especially for conspiracy thriller lovers who need to lighten it up a bit as a change of pace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QIPTT5ZDYDIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USSDLPA#wasThisHelpful","R3QIPTT5ZDYDIR","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cinnamon and Burro are investigators for New Mexico, but they are not detectives, per se. Their job is to get to the bottom of an alleged civil rights violation in a middle school that is preventing an autistic boy from getting the therapy and instruction he needs. What they find is a lot of hostility from the school's administrator and staff, and possibly the murder of the boy they've come to help.This story is not your ordinary cozy mystery. The investigators are not trying to find a murderer, are not well-meaning amateurs, and do not reveal clues along the way for the reader to solve the mystery along with the characters. I generally prefer mysteries that allow me to match my solving skills against the characters'.There was a back story to the character of Cinnamon that is reference several times throughout the story about how her mother abandoned her and her father when she was very young. Her mother ended up in New Mexico which is why Cinnamon (which was also her mother's name, just to keep things confusing) now works in the state as she tries to find places and people her mother may have encountered. I found this sub-plot to be distracting from the main plot, and I was unsympathetic to an adult who is still not able to simply move on from childhood disappointments decades later, especially when it is distracting her from her job.So why the four stars? It's because the important part of this story is not the mystery, it's about bigotry and the misunderstandings surrounding autism. It's an important topic, often with answers that are not always the obvious ones, and that sometimes the people in charge of the presumed answers shouldn't be.Mildly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2484Y4MDSEU99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042RUKGG#wasThisHelpful","R2484Y4MDSEU99","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caswell ""Cash"" Harrison is in his last year of law school at Columbia when the US enters World War II. Unable to join the military due to a medical problem, he searches for another way to serve his country and make a difference to the war effort. Through acquaintances and connections in his hometown of Philadelphia, he is offered a position as a law clerk to one of the Supreme Court Justices for a year. Cash is urged to take the opportunity, but he soon finds that the road to justice is not always as clear cut as he would want to believe as cases decided before the Court are often more about the war, politics, and ulterior motives than constitutional law. Cash soon suspects there is something more sinister to the selection of clerks and the deciding of cases to be heard before the Court than is apparent from the outside, and believes he could be in danger if he continues to investigate those suspicions.There are elements of historical fact, fiction, legal thriller, conspiracy, and mystery all woven into this book as told from the viewpoint of the somewhat idealistic and naive main character. Thrown into the deep end of the Washington shark tank, he's unprepared for the environment in which he finds himself. There are also elements of a coming-of-age story as Cash grows into his new position and learns that secrets are shared and favors traded as part of the workings behind the scenes of government. After getting off to a slow start with a bit of nostalgia for the time and some flowery prose, the book picks up the pace and moves along swiftly once Cash finds his way to Washington and his desk at the Supreme Court.The important focus of the book is the background information about the major cases that come to the Supreme Court as part of the war effort, more specifically those dealing with the detention and internment of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast. Other important cases of the era are mentioned, some in depth, such as those dealing with the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and the rulings that allowed the trial of German spies captured on US soil to be tried in military courts rather than civilian courts.There are appearances by many historical characters including J. Edgar Hoover and his number two man, Clyde Tolson, Hugo Black and Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court, Attorney General Biddle, and various members of the Department of Justice and Department of War. The author has included an extensive note at the end of the book pointing out where fact ends and fiction begins for each of the supporting characters mentioned in the story.To be entertained by a book is a joy, but to be both entertained and educated is a greater one. This book shows what goes into background manipulations, thought processes, political realities, and trade offs that occur as part of the workings of both the courts and the federal government in general when dealing with the legal system. There is no reason to believe that the basics of the processes have changed much in the intervening years.Highly recommended for those interested in the history of the World War II era, Supreme Court processes and landmark cases of the early 1940s, and anyone enjoying a complex thriller.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MCQHL647PWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GIASY#wasThisHelpful","R37MCQHL647PWZ","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I gained at least five pounds just reading this book. There are so many scrumptious recipes and insider techniques for using them in this book that it could easily keep a home baker in new creations for years. The strong point of these recipes is that they can be used in multiple ways by changing the fillings, toppings, and shaping to come up with different types of pastries.After sections introducing the home baker to the necessary equipment, gadgets, ingredients, and basic techniques needed in order to create these masterpieces, the book gets into the preparation of the fillings and toppings that are mixed-and-matched with various types of doughs such as Almond Paste Filling, Apricot Butter, and Chocolate Custard, for example.The text is dotted with ""Baker's Secret"" entries giving more insider information on various topics such as on how to shape various types of dough, how to choose the best ingredients, and the best way to freeze and thaw extra portions. The recipe and technique instructions and hints are clearly presented and explained.The recipes for the doughs are the main event of the book. Most of the recipes given such as Bundt (not the formed cake that most people think of), Babka, Gugelhopf, Stollen, and Strudel make fairly large amounts, but clear instructions are given on how to store the excess doughs for later use in other recipes. The flexibility of each of these doughs when paired with different fillings or shapes to make the many old-world pastries that were a mainstay of local ethnic bakeries is nothing short of astounding.Highly recommended for both beginners and experienced home bakers.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TE4ZSHRMQZT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1IG1V2#wasThisHelpful","R2TE4ZSHRMQZT6","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The town of South Cove is sponsoring a charity 5K run and walk in aid of the California Mission Society. The event seems to be a hit with the participants until one of them takes a fall and lands on a lifeless body hidden near the course. As if having a murderer running loose isn't bad enough, one of the local businesses has become the target for a vandal. The owner of Coffee, Books, and More, Jill Gardner and her Aunt Jackie, who have a reputation for solving crimes, decide to help find some answers.This book has a lot going for it. The small town setting makes you wish you lived there among all of the unique shops and friendly people with an easy walk to the beach. The cast of supporting characters, with one or two exceptions, are people that you'd like to have as your friends to meet for lunch or just to hang out on the beach together. The two mysteries give the reader puzzles to solve while enjoying the town's atmosphere and its good vibes. The murder mystery is presented in a way that allows the reader to solve it along with Jill and Aunt Jackie, which is the type of cozy I prefer.I like the main character, Jill, too. She is a competent and independent woman who manages to juggle the demands of her business, her work with the town's business committee, her love life, and her obligations to her family which includes her aunt and her employees. No scatterbrain or whimpering damsel, instead she is an educated, modern woman who can hold her own without panicking or waffling. Her septuagenarian aunt is an older take-charge version of Jill rather than a stereotypical doddering old lady. Both could be considered wonderful role models for younger readers.I have not read the previous books in the series, but that lack of background information did not detract from the story or in understanding the characters. This book works well as a stand-alone story.Recommended.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNJU1Q10O2IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNBLXX0#wasThisHelpful","R2FNJU1Q10O2IU","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a crisis on its way to France in the form of a flotilla of a hundred rusty ships carrying almost one million poor, starving migrants from Calcutta. As the ships slowly make their way to the Mediterranean, the popular media gush about how best to welcome the newcomers. More pragmatic observers realize that the entry of all of these people en masse will change the West's way of life forever and try to sound the alarm to save the country from the invasion.This book was written in 1973 and made available in an English translation in 1975, but the vision of a Third World invasion of the West as described in the book is even more relevant today as we see in frequent news reports of troubles with migrants in Europe and our own political rhetoric in the United States about immigration issues.The writing style is very literary and at times a bit flowery with many twists of scene as events are repeated from various viewpoints. It is not a quick read and will require the reader's concentration to navigate among the various metaphors, concepts, and personalities.Abandon any thoughts of ""political correctness"" when reading this book. It presents the reality of the world's population rather than a Utopia of the brotherhood of mankind. As a a non-white character from the book, Monsieur Hamadura, who has embraced France and its culture points out, it's not only race that matters, but the whole common culture, language, and heritage that is threatened by a massive influx of people of other backgrounds. The message and the warning presented is: in a war of the haves versus the have-nots, it is the haves who will lose if they are unwilling or unable to defend themselves against the invaders.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JW70EMUFEHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1881780074#wasThisHelpful","R5JW70EMUFEHB","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once you open up the bottle and take a sniff of the contents, you'll probably recognize it as that special scent that's in those scrumptious sweet rolls that you buy at an old-fashioned bakery. It's a bit butter-y and a bit citrus-y and it adds an extra flavor punch to your own homemade cinnamon buns and sweet rolls.I use one teaspoon of the Buttery Sweet Dough flavoring in my cinnamon rolls in addition to the vanilla called for in my recipe that makes a dozen rolls.

"Ray Doaks is returning to the farm where he grew up after spending two years in prison. What he finds is his closest friend, Pete Culpepper, trying to juggle a failing farm, a small time racing stable down to its last gelding and a couple of broodmares, and a pile of debt. He also finds that Sonny Stanton, the ne'er do well son of the local billionaire, has been trying to buy up the farms to turn them into a housing development and golf course while using some underhanded tactics to force some of them sell out.The book is slow to get moving while introducing the characters, their circumstances, and their relationships, but picks up speed once the introductions are made. Once it gets rolling, the payoff that is coming is worth the slight delay.Most of the characters are plain folks just trying to do a good day's work and make a living, but the one bad guy stands out for what he is: a bully who will use his father's money and influence to push other people around without ever suffering any consequences.The main character, Ray, is someone who always tries to make things right even if he has to use questionable means to set things straight. In the book, a character calls him a ""Robin Hood"" which pretty well sums him up. The complex plan he cooks up and puts into motion to set things to rights is a classic.Other characters who the reader will want to cheer for include Paulie, the animal-loving poor relation; Etta, a dutiful daughter trying to save her father's farm while he sinks into senility; and Jackson, the horse trainer and manager who tries to keep his boss's stable running in spite of Sonny's actions.Recommended, especially for those readers who like a good sting operation or just like to see bullies get their just rewards in a clever and entertaining manner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114Z0EXPWIMVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805072179#wasThisHelpful","R114Z0EXPWIMVK","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, even long-time Linux users have stacks of old floppies with archived information that sometimes needs to be accessed.Recent Linux distros should be able to recognize and mount this device with just a couple of mouse clicks. I tested it on a couple of currently supported Mageia distros and had no problems with it being found and was able to read several floppy formats without a glitch.Older Linux distros may take a bit more prodding to find the device, but usually just a reboot with the device connected or a scan via the distro's administrative tools will find it and mount it. I tested it with an older Mandriva distro and was able to mount it manually via a command line as root within a terminal session.For Windows users, I also tested this floppy on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. All recognized the drive and mounted it for use without any additional user interaction necessary. I will caution users planning on upgrading to Windows 10, that it will not include drivers for USB floppy drives by default in its main package.

"The United States has been split due to an assassination and coup by a renegade politician, Simon Sterling, and his cronies and who has established what he has called the Unified American Empire. A section of the former USA calling themselves the Pacific States of America, has elected Howard Beck, a computer science genius and industrialist, as their president. In his sanctuary in the Rocky Mountains, Beck has a plan to defeat the usurper and restore the republic using his high-tech expertise with the help of his advanced artificial intelligence software he calls Hal.A warning: Don't try reading this book unless you have first read its predecessor, Collapse (New America-Book One), or you will be thoroughly confused by the cast of characters and the reasons for their actions. Take the time to read that one first to save time trying to understand this book and to be able just to enjoy the fun instead.This book follows the same pattern with multiple seemingly unrelated subplots that were initiated in the first book continuing here. They are each important to the overall plot, but often in ways that are not clear to the reader, but they do become merged into the main story at various points. Think of it as getting several stories for the price of one umbrella story.The battle of the PSA versus the UAE sometimes seems like something out of a Star Wars movie, but that's part of the ride. The political thriller is alive and well underneath the gee-whiz gadgets.

It's pretty much a no-go zone for outsiders, but Sheriff Lil and Boris, the deputy sheriff cat, have to brave the hostile group when they try to investigate the death of the family's matriarch, Vera Collier. Complicating matters is the fact that Vera did not leave a will, but did leave a house full of stuff that rumor says includes a hidden fortune in stock certificates and cash.This book is a double dip of a humorous look at insular small towns and family connections plus a better than average mystery.There are plenty of twists and turns to the mystery and a long list of possible suspects to keep things moving along. There are a some sub-plots outside of the murder mystery involving some of the more colorful Crazy residents and the on-going feud between the Littlepages and Ellers.Does anyone besides me wonder why Boris isn't getting top billing? I've known many cats over the years, and Boris's actions and reactions are spot on. The only unusual thing is that lie detector tail of his that I have yet to see in any other cat, but it's a very useful thing for a deputy sheriff to have.The first book, Crazy, VA (Lil & Boris #1) (Lil and Boris Mysteries), set the scene of the town and inhabitants of Crazy, but this book can be read as a stand-alone mystery.

To launch a new line of products, an extravagant party is being held at her home and the products are well-received. But the party comes to a sudden end when Alicia appears at the head of the stairs, screams, then falls to the bottom of the stairs dead. An investigation ensues.After an intriguing set up and murder scene, the book quickly took a turn for the worse. What credible police department would allow a group of women whose day job is running an ice cream parlor to all but take over a murder investigation? The premise of many cozies have a talented amateur or two looking for clues in parallel with the official investigation, but this one has a tag team of amateurs who take turns attending interrogations, poking around crime scenes, and telling the police detective what he should do. If the graduate students working at the shop were majoring in criminology, psychology, or some other related disciple, it might be plausible to have one or two of them around the crime scene as interns or trainees, but for English and civil engineering majors to not only be invited to observe but actually to be asked to assist with the investigation and taking on the bulk of the work from the police? No, I'm not buying the scenario.The mystery itself has lot of red herrings and dead ends mixed in with a lot of wheel spinning by the semi-official investigators. The solution of the crime was credible, but the investigation would have been even more credible without the ice cream girls seeming to be in charge instead of remaining in a supporting role to the real investigation.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQ9Q8T3MOPNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V93QGCI#wasThisHelpful","R1QQ9Q8T3MOPNV","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Little Detective Agency consists of Bernie the brawn of the agency and Chet the brains of the pair. By the way, Chet is a dog. When an illegally transplanted Saguaro cactus mysteriously appears in their elderly neighbor's yard, Bernie and Chet dive into the case in order to clear their neighbor of any wrong-doing, but there turns out to be something much more sinister going on than stealing cacti from federal lands, and the two soon find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation and more.The gimmick of this cozy is in the narration from the viewpoint of Chet, the dog. He's dedicated to both Bernie and his professional standing as a detective who tracks down perps and puts them into orange jumpsuits, as we find out through his telling of the story. We also find out that he does not have a good memory for details, although bits and pieces of previous investigations are threaded throughout the current story. It's a cute way of telling a story, but at times it gets too cloying and repetitive to the detriment of the flow of the mystery. Perhaps if the book's point of view had switched from Chet to Bernie and back it would have kept the idea fresher and moved the story along more smoothly.The mystery is basically a good one with a lot going on to keep the reader interested. The ending was marred by some loose ends left hanging and some missing explanations as to the motives of various characters' actions.While the premise of a dog detective and story teller make a fun cozy, this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to occasional rough language and descriptions of violence.Mildly recommended for those readers who don't mind a rougher edge to their cozies.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB25OTD3TSQ15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434DEC#wasThisHelpful","RB25OTD3TSQ15","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The United States has suffered an attack from unknown enemies using multiple EMP devices that takes out seventy percent of the nation's electrical grid and electronic devices. The population in those areas is suddenly without all of the infrastructure and support services that they rely on for day-to-day life. A small portion of that population has prepared for such a disaster, but now their greatest challenge is not doing without the electrical grid, but fighting off those who would take away what they have.This is more than a book that is simply urging preparedness for emergencies and cataloging a list of supplies or actions towards that effort. There are two other important plots woven in, one about a militia group and their not-quite-sane leader, and another about an overall conspiracy behind the initial EMP attacks and the attempt to alert authorities before the wrong enemy is punished for the chaos it has caused. There are also minor subplots dealing with the attempts to repair a segment of the generation grid which underlines the difficulties and frustrations that would exist if a similar event were to actually occur, and another about a group of Wall Street brokers who are caught by the event while on vacation.The descriptions of the civil unrest in urban and suburban areas are chilling, but in a real event, I fear could be much worse than those described in the book and would begin much sooner after a massive shutdown. Overall the book entertains while giving a warning of what could happen.The conspiracy portion of the plot does not contain a lot of details on the who, why, and how, but would be an excellent topic to be explored in a prequel to the events in this book.Recommended, but with a warning to those who may be put off by some of the more brutal events and actions described in portions of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQAJYVHDDYEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108S9V0I#wasThisHelpful","RVQAJYVHDDYEC","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Howard Beck has created an empire with his innovations in computer science and software development and has reaped a fortune from his inventions. His crowning achievement is an ultimate artificial intelligence program which he has guarded closely. When the United States finds itself beset by a second Great Depression followed by number of natural disasters, the country is plunged into martial law after the death of the president. The lives of an escaped convict, a small town police chief, and Beck cross paths and join together with Beck's A.I. to try to remove the tyrant and restore the country to its people.After being introduced to the reclusive main characters, Beck and his A.I,. there are several seemingly unrelated subplots inserted with a variety of characters that seem to be out of place and far from the main action. From a hurricane in coastal Texas, to a prison escape in California, presidential politics and dirty dealing, a homeless family in New York City, and anarchy in Florida, the author manages to bring together all of these subplots into the main story and make them relevant to the overall plot.There are a few minor plot points that seem to have been lost along the way, such as whatever happened to the two pet cats rescued in Texas, but overall the juggling of all of these various characters comes together as the pieces of the plot puzzle are fitted together. Especially fascinating is the shifting of some characters who originally are cast as bad guys who turn out to be not what they seem and vice-versa for several of the good guys. It helps to keep up the reader's interest while also keeping the surprise level high.The book ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger in order to set things up for the next installment of the story in part two of the series, Resistance in the New America series.Recommended for those who enjoy political thrillers, stories about advanced artificial intelligence, and dystopian fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8BW0SW29TSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HYUFWO#wasThisHelpful","RY8BW0SW29TSA","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The town of Ellington is staging a massive event of coordinated yard and garage sales in order to bring in tourists to spend money at the sale and with their local businesses. Sarah Winston has been hired by the town's manager to organize the event and ensure its success. When a series of fires are set around the town and a body turns up in one of the local shops, the ensuing investigation turns up more questions than answers.There are several elements that make up a good cozy mystery: interesting characters and their relationships, a clever mystery with lots of clues for the reader to share in searching out the perpetrator, and enough twists to the plot to keep things fresh and interesting. This book has those three elements.I had not read the previous book in this series, so I was not familiar with the background events, but that did not detract from my enjoyment of the mystery. It can be read as a stand alone without affecting the mystery or its solution; however, it would have clarified the past relationship between the main character, Sarah, and her ex-husband CJ the town's chief of police for one of the sub-plots and that knowledge would have made the interplay between them more understandable.The theme of garage and yard sales and thrift stores was simply part of the scenery to me just as much as the setting of the small New England town. I'm not a garage sale maven, so the descriptions and details about holding them or buying from them were foreign territory and of no interest to me except as they moved the story and mystery along.The mystery presented is many-layered and generates several of the sub-plots of the book most of which converge to help to uncover the murderer. This is not a simple, straight-forward whodunit so those readers who prefer a bit more complexity to their cozies will not be disappointed.Recommended for those who prefer the more complex cozies.A free copy of this ebook was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJV1HSTV6CXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTS4UM#wasThisHelpful","R1DJV1HSTV6CXU","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Investigative journalist Michael Chenault is presented with information about the murder of a retired professor of history in upstate New York that may tie into the murder of the wife of Utah Senator Brockston Ratchford, a front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Chenault heads out to Utah to track down how and why the two murders could possibly be related.There's a nice mix of history, investigation, mystery, treasure hunt, and conspiracy in this book along with a very likable main character in Michael Chenault. The history and organization of the LDS church is mysterious in and of itself to most readers, and as such offers a wealth of possibilities for the story to evolve around it. The unlikable politician, Ratchford, and his minion Fiske show the shady side of politicians and their aides, so it's easy for the reader to root against them as they use their position to try to derail Chenault's investigation.I found some elements of the ending somewhat predictable, but that says more about how many thrillers I've read over the years rather than anything negative about the build-up to the exciting ending of the book. I would welcome another book featuring Chenault on another investigative adventure.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RI955UU0AZ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G756WYU#wasThisHelpful","R1RI955UU0AZ0W","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My HP laptop kept overheating and shutting down under heavy use that required a lot of disk drive or DVD drive activity, so I needed a solution that would be lightweight and portable yet deliver the cooling power required to keep it running.This Cooler Master product fits my requirements beautifully. It's lightweight, so it doesn't add a lot of extra ounces to my laptop bag. It will fit in my bag along with the laptop, but it is a tight fit and requires a bit of wiggling to get both in. If you've got a slimline case or sleeve for your laptop, you may need to upgrade to a larger case to fit them both properly.It's quiet, and it puts out plenty of cooling power, which will be even more welcome this summer since some of the cool air blows out from under the laptop right at the user. Just a whisper of a breeze, but noticeable.The one possible point of future failure that I can foresee would be the wire that connects the USB plug to the unit. The wire is thin enough to allow it to be flexible so it can be seated within a channel under the unit in such a way to allow the user to connect to the laptop's USB port on either side. It is not reinforced where is goes into the plug or fan. There is a ""parking spot"" for the USB plug under the unit to secure it when not in use or when in transit. There are posts to wrap the wire around when securing the plug. With excessive use, I could see this wire wearing or breaking off near the connection points. With careful handling, this should not be a problem for most users, but should be kept in mind when securing the wire and plug or changing the side on which the plug is used on the laptop.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJEJAIOE2E0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ1COYO#wasThisHelpful","R2RJEJAIOE2E0T","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series of books is designed for beginning bakers and contains some helpful information, but repeats the first four chapters in each book. Once you've read one book, you've already been instructed in the basics of equipment, types of sweeteners, fats and oils, and so forth.Once the reader gets past the first four chapters, the specific information about pies and pie crusts finally begins.There are basic recipes for one and two crust pies with detailed information about how to create a flaky crust for your selected fillings. There are also recipes for more unusual crusts such as a Double Cheddar Pie Crust and two types of cracker crusts. I've never seen a pie crust recipe that suggested vodka or gin as a possible cold liquid to use in a crust. I think I will pass on this idea and stick to ice water in my crusts.Filling recipes include Berry Pie, Apple Pie, Key Lime Pie, Strawberry Lime Pie, and Oreo Crust Pie.Each recipe has detailed instructions to lead the home baker through each step, hand-holding the beginner or intermediate baker through to an edible dessert. I would caution a true beginner from trying the Oreo Crust Pie as a first attempt since the filling preparation is much more complicated than that for a fruit-filled pie.There is a section at the end of the book containing various conversion charts and tips for baking, including high altitude adjustments to recipes.This series is short on recipes in each volume and high on general kitchen and baking information. I would have preferred if the author and publisher had chosen to make one stand-alone volume with the general information, then concentrate on the specifics of one facet of baking in each successive volume to avoid the repetition of content. It would have allowed more space for more recipes and specific baking tips. For example, I would have liked to have seen a section on how to do decorative pie crusts such as fluted edges or lattice tops instead of the repeated data that had nothing to do with pies and crusts.Still there is worthwhile information here and the recipes are well-presented. For someone who has not read any of the other ebooks in the series, the first four chapters will be new and instructive.Recommended for those who want basic information about how to to bake pies and pie crusts or to improve their skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5UAN3S45JS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANGIVZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1B5UAN3S45JS7","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nancy Keller and her ex-husband, Ron, are business partners in a coffee shop and bakery. The partnership is suddenly brought to an end when Nancy finds Ron dead on the shop's floor early one morning.Cozy mysteries usually rely on a variety of well-drawn characters to pull the reader into the story. There are a lot of characters introduced in this book, but none of them, including the main character, are very well defined. Superficial information is sprinkled into the text such as age, hair color, and height of various characters, but little else. What makes these characters tick? Besides age and hair color what differentiates one from another?Cozy mysteries are also usually more relaxed when dealing with normal police procedures, leaving those details to the more rigorous types of police procedural mysteries. Cozies should still be bound by the basics of common sense as to the way the authorities must investigate a crime. There is no way that a person who is a possible suspect, related to the victim, and is the one who discovered the body would be allowed to sit in on interrogations of other suspects even if she is dating the sheriff. But that is precisely what the author had the main character doing repeatedly. No, that simply won't fly, even in a small community.There were also no consequences forthcoming when Nancy admits to her boyfriend sheriff that she's removed evidence from the scene. How about ""tampering with evidence"" or the ever-popular ""obstruction of justice"" charges? According to the flow of the story, the sheriff didn't even raise an eyebrow at the revelation. What is he doing investigating a crime in which his girlfriend is involved when there are other members of the police force in the town?The dialog is simplistic and comes across as stilted and unnatural. There are several detours into descriptions of the steps of making a pie or cake that go on for no good purpose. Even the reason behind the murder didn't make a whole lot of sense and doesn't stand up once the reader thinks it through.The book also suffered from formatting difficulties.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1JSG8TVMTN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1NLQWW#wasThisHelpful","R2X1JSG8TVMTN3","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're the type of Internet user who checks out the photographs and captions on the ""I Can Has Cheezburger?"" website as part of your daily routine, then this book is for you. It's packed with the same type of silly cat pictures with even sillier captions as the website, but in the more permanent format of an ebook.I dare any cat lover to page through this book without breaking out in chuckles, giggles, and/or LOLs. You've got to wonder how people not only got their cats into such poses, but how they had the camera ready for just the right moment. What's amazing is that the photographs and captions are just as funny time after time.

"I first discovered Milka Chocolate products when I was on a business trip to Germany. I came back home with my carry-on bag stuffed with Milka bars. I was thrilled when I found that I could get the same good German Milka chocolate from Amazon.And unlike some chocolates that are European brands but made elsewhere under license and often with modified recipes, these chocolate bars are really and truly from Germany. It's the same recipe, the same chocolate, and the same taste that I got when I purchased them in Germany.If you've never had a Milka bar, you're in for a treat. They are smooth and creamy tasting and melt in your mouth.

"Lauren Atkinson has spent her career as a lawyer fighting for inmates on Death Row to try to get their sentences changed to life in prison without parole. She's won a few fights and lost many, but now her principles are going to be tested when a tragedy strikes close to home.There are no easy answers to the debate about the right or wrong of the death penalty, and none are given in this book for the reader or for the characters. It is the story of how a family reacts to and deals with the results of a heinous crime and comes with a mystery to be solved as Lauren tries to find a murderer.This book does not argue for or against the death penalty. Instead, it puts the reader into the life of an attorney who is passionately opposed to the use of the ultimate penalty, and how she uses her knowledge of the system to work her way through her own personal tragedy. It becomes more a story of how one's principles can be tested when they are placed squarely up against personal realities rather than are simply some abstract concept and ideal. There is battle that takes place within Lauren that tears down and changes her relationships with those around her including her husband, Michael; her law partner, Gary; and even her clients on Death Row.The characters are well-drawn, the dialog believable, and the situations could be pulled from police files. The reader can grieve with the victims and their families and see the dark side that is the reality of prisoners' and criminals' lives.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YFW8131OPGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GFQAR8#wasThisHelpful","R6YFW8131OPGN","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A stolen day with a young man visiting her village turns to love quickly for Felicity Sims. The problem is, the young man thinks he's spending the day with Rita Rodgers. Once he finds out the truth, will he be able to forgive Felicity for the deception?What starts out as a sappy romantic interlude and a description of young yearning love with no Poiret in sight, eventually fast-forwards into the setting for the mystery a decade down the timeline. The reader may want to have a diagram to sort out the relationships of the characters since it gets complicated, but it's necessary to understand them in order to follow the trail of events. While the relationships are complex, the mystery itself and its solution are fairly simple ones.Like most of these Poiret mysteries, the characters' dialog will seem very unnatural and stilted to modern readers.Moderately recommended as a quick, simple, soapy mystery to use as a time-filler.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV385118EK6SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1JLQ5A#wasThisHelpful","RV385118EK6SL","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rural reporter and stringer for a London newspaper happens to be at the right place as a story unfolds in a village restaurant. Poiret is present as well to unravel the truth behind the story being told.The mystery itself seems rushed and without much ""meat"" to it. There is little for the reader to grab onto to follow the reasoning behind the conclusions Poiret seems to jump to in order to solve the case. For anyone trying to follow the logic behind the supposed clues, it will be a true mystery even after the big reveal of the crime and culprit as to how Poiret managed to jump to his final accusation.The more amusing parts of the story are those that feature the tabloid editor and his correspondence with the distant reporter. The amusement continues as the harried editor passes judgment on the reporter's submissions and makes edits to save the gentle sensibilities of the newspaper's readers. This view into the workings of London editorial practices of the time was more entertaining than the mystery itself.Not recommended. This is one of the weaker examples of the Poiret series of short story mysteries set in early 20th century England.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELPNBLAJMCIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2VMO76#wasThisHelpful","R3ELPNBLAJMCIO","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mel, Angie, and Tate are partners in a new cupcake bakery in Old Town Scottsdale, with Tate being the bankroll while the girls mind the store. Things seem to be getting off to a good start until Tate's fiancée, Christie, is found in her design studio with one of Mel's specially made cupcakes in her cold, dead hand.The big selling point of cozy mysteries to me are likable characters who you would love to have as friends if they were real people, and this new series delivers them. The relationship among the three main characters makes you want to pull up a bucket of popcorn and join them in one of their movie nights. The supporting characters are a good mixture of understanding good guys, meddling relatives, and even a slightly-evil competitor who are all unique and add to the atmosphere of the cozy.The mystery can be classified as a solve-along, which is the type I prefer. The clues are there just waiting for the reader to pick them up along with Mel. The story moves along at a quick pace and weaves the workings of the bakery into the investigation and interactions of the characters.The descriptions of the cupcake flavors are clever and will probably become dangerous to the readers' waistlines as they can cause cravings to occur. Several of the cupcake and frosting recipes mentioned in the story are included at the end of the book, as is a preview of the next book in the series.Highly recommended.

"Dekker and Murdock are called out of semi-retirement again to solve two apparent murders at County High School's 20 year reunion celebration. Everyone seemed to have a motive, but lacked opportunity. In spite of the general opinion of good riddance of the victims, the detectives follow the clues and uncover another mystery that's been hidden for two decades.This book, although it contains a pretty good mystery, is dragged down by the repetitive descriptions of the off-time pursuits of the two main characters. Yes, I like to have background characterization of the people in cozy mysteries, but there is a point where it becomes tedious, repetitive, and acts more to pad out the size of the book rather than to endear the characters to the reader. That point was reached in this book.It's nice to know that our tubby detectives are trying to lose weight, but how many Wii Fit sessions do the readers need to sit through while they do it? Instead of cataloging how much gravy and what kind of desserts they enjoy as done in previous books, we now learn how many cherry tomatoes or olives they have with their salad and so on. For every meal. Too much information! I got the point the first time.The same thing goes for the reading lists of our heroes. I began to think I was part of an infomercial for a mystery book club with the lists of authors and books they planned to read. Twice.I did enjoy the mystery, but I found myself way ahead of Dekker and Murdock and kept waiting for them to catch up with me on figuring out the clues while they repeatedly Wii-ed, discussed their reading list, and prepared meals.My favorite character in this book was Lightning, Dekker's yellow VW bug.Moderately recommended for those following the series and characters, but others would probably become frustrated by the story's many delays and wanderings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFLMII9R1B1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPROGQU#wasThisHelpful","R1SFLMII9R1B1V","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using Post-It Notes as page markers for many years. Full sized Post-It Notes, small sized Post-It Notes, and even in desperate times large Post-It Notes. I've been known to sit at my desk with a pair of scissors to cut up a few regular sized Notes into strips to use as page markers. Not the best use of my time, and I could never get those strips the same size consistently anyway.But no more! I now have these wonderful COLORFUL Post-It Page Markers that were made especially for the job. No more wasting a big Note for a small job. No more sitting and cutting strips. These are ready to go, as is. 3M was also thoughtful enough to make the sticky portion of each strip a little bit wider than on a regular Note, so the strip will be held securely to the page position where it is placed.And the best part are the colors. I love the rainbow!Now I can use these Page Markers to color code places in books or reports as to what type of information I'm marking. Think of all the possibilities! For example, when marking recipes in a cookbook you can use one color for main dishes, one for desserts, and another for side dishes. You could highlight technical details or financial ones in a business report based on the specifically referenced item. Or for a knitting pattern book, you could use different colors to indicate whether the marked pattern is for a sweater, accessory, or an item for the home. Or even go deeper into organization and use more colors for whether it's a man or woman's sweater pattern. Not exactly endless possibilities, but with ten colors from which to choose, you can get pretty specific in your categories.These are the best invention since, well, the Post-It Note itself.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8D6YYS0AZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QFATEO#wasThisHelpful","R3L8D6YYS0AZEH","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young Jess Williams is on the trail again, this time in search of Tim Sloan, his twin brother whom he's never known. Work comes to him that his brother is waiting for him back in Black Creek in order to kill him for a $10,000 bounty placed on his head by a ranch owner who hates Jess for killing his only son.Those who have read the first installment of this series, THE RECKONING: A Jess Williams Western, will be familiar with the story of how a teenager became a bounty hunter and fast drawn artist. Mentioned in that first story was the revelation to Jess that he had a twin brother who was taken from his mother at birth. Most of this book deals with their inevitable meeting.Students of psychology will also know of the on-going argument of nature versus nurture in the development of a person's value system and personality and the debate over which one is more important. This book sides strongly on the nurture side of the argument as the ""good"" twin, Jess was raised in a loving home with solid traditional values instilled in him while the ""bad"" twin, Tim, was raised mostly by his mean-spirited, poker cheat, misogynist father who passed all of these negative traits onto his son. The contrasts are not subtle.There is a somewhat humorous subplot involving two nave, would-be bounty hunters from back East whom Jess befriends.While the story is gripping, the book fails in its atrocious formatting and poor copy editing. The formatting is slightly better than that in the first book, but it still needs a lot of work to make it consistent and more readable throughout the book. A copy editor who knows what a past participle is and how to use it properly is also sorely needed. These failings cost the book a star in my rating.I'm hooked on the series and the Jess Williams character now, but I hope that the problems of formatting and editing improve with each new installment.Recommended for those who enjoy gritty Westerns.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3SGLKSY4XAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FYT24G#wasThisHelpful","RA3SGLKSY4XAJ","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dame Frevisse is a nun at St. Frideswide monastery in the mid-15th century who has an uncanny knack at solving mysteries. Included in this collection of stories featuring Dame Frevisse are ""The Witch's Tale,"" ""The Midwife's Tale,"" and ""The Store-Worker's Tale"" along with a preview of the full length novel, ""The Novice's Tale.""

"Captain Haven has been invited to visit an old friend at his cottage in the Lake District, and Detective Poiret decides to tag along. When they get to the cottage, Poiret's observations lead him to believe that Haven's friend is acting oddly and that the situation is not quite what they expected.This short story presents a quick mystery that is solved not through forensics or stealth, but through simple observations and conclusions arrived at from those observations, then confirmed by Poiret's questioning of witnesses afterward.Poiret is an odd duck of a detective who always refers to himself in the third person for reasons not explained, except perhaps by less than perfect English skills. It is not explained where he works as a detective, nor is a reason given for his accompanying his friend on this journey for which he seems ill-prepared and uncomfortable. Since this is one of a long series of stories involving the character of Poiret, I would assume that these details are explained in previous installments of his adventures.The writing is a bit archaic and stilted to modern readers, and the story meanders at times and seems overly rushed at others.Mildly recommended as a quick diversion for mystery lovers or those who like to peek in at the lifestyle of an earlier age.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIT0NIZZZO4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFWM360#wasThisHelpful","RMIT0NIZZZO4O","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got both this small offset spatula and the medium size. When I bought them, I thought I'd be primarily using the medium one for decorating and frosting tasks, but I've actually found more uses for the smaller 4.5 inch one.Not only is this smaller spatula easier to handle when making frosting swirls on cupcakes and along the sides of full sized cakes, it's the perfect tool to use when spreading filling for jelly roll style baked items such as cinnamon buns. I also use it to even up strusel toppings on coffee cakes before baking, lifting brownies out of a baking pan, and spreading fillings between layers of cake batter. The smaller size makes it so much easier to get into the corners of the baking pans.The spatula is sturdy and has a real wood handle. The stainless steel flexible blade means that you won't have to worry about rust or discoloration over time.Well made, affordable, and versatile. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QX4JJ01FQIF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WG14FC#wasThisHelpful","R3QX4JJ01FQIF8","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many of us, I grew up with the original Oreo cookies. The addition of multiple versions and flavors to the Oreo line has been a terrific marketing choice by Nabisco.When I saw this Mega Stuf version of the cookies, I was thinking that since I liked Double Stuf Oreos, I'd like these even more. Who wouldn't love more Stuf?But when first taking the cookies out of the bag, they didn't look any different than the ones I'd been buying that were labeled Double Stuf. Mega to me means it should have noticeably more filling than the Double ones. If they do have more, it's such a tiny difference that it's not noticeable.They still taste like Oreos with crisp chocolate cookie layers and creamy filling, so they won't go to waste. They just don't say ""Mega"" to me.One note about the packaging of the cookies. The pull up and re-seal package makes it harder to get to the cookies on the edges. It's also more difficult to re-seal securely. Why not go to a simpler design of a zip-lock seal on the end of the package? The tray of cookies could slide out to take out what you need, then slide the tray back into the bag and zip it closed.Recommended, but you can get pretty much the same thing with the Double Stuf Oreos that have been available for years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272H4531XEV34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKL52YC#wasThisHelpful","R272H4531XEV34","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Times are tough for Bezu Gordon and it's gotten to the point that she's had to take in lodgers to help pay the bills. Things get even tougher when one of those tenants drops dead one night after eating one of Bezu's homemade muffins.I enjoyed the first installment in this cozy mystery series set in Savannah, Georgia, and had been looking forward to revisiting the same characters in another story. While the first book was narrated from the viewpoint of Cat Thompson who did most of the detective work, this book was told from the viewpoint of Bezu.The reader isn't told much about Bezu except that her old, historic house is falling apart, and she has a mountain of debt. How has she found herself in this predicament? Why hasn't she found some paying work in the city? What does she do all day besides sip sweet tea? None of this is explained or even hinted at, which makes it harder to relate to the character. Since Bezu was the focus of the mystery and the narrator of the story, I would have expected to find out much more about her.Another thing missing from the story is the Chubby Chicks Club as they were introduced in the first book. A big factor that made the first book engaging was the close and supportive relationship this group of friends had. One of the members was the victim of the last book, but also missing this time was one of the lead amateur detectives from the first story, Annie Mae. I was expecting another case of the club members rallying together as an ensemble to solve the mystery, yet it came down to just Cat doing the legwork with Bezu as her usually ineffective and bland partner. Policeman José from the Club only pops in to share information when needed to move the story along.Those who have not read the first book in the series, Dying for Dinner Rolls (Cozy Mystery) Book #1 (Chubby Chicks Club Cozy Mystery Series), may be confused by the many references to characters and events that from that book.The mystery itself wasn't much of one. The outcome of the case and the characters' actions were predictable to the point that the big reveal wasn't a surprise since even a moderately observant reader would have seen it coming halfway through the book. There were no red herrings, multiple viable suspects, or misleading clues to distract from the straight line leading to the culprit.Not recommended. Those who prefer a more challenging solve-along mystery will be disappointed at the simplicity of the plot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTEU1X2NGHGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MT79E0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3JTEU1X2NGHGM","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're the type of baker who is looking for some new ideas of how to dress up your cupcakes for special occasions, this book is for you. Even if you're not into doing any fancy decorating, this book is worth a look just to admire the talent and creativity shown in these uber-fancy cupcake decoration ideas.There are no recipes for cupcakes included. All of these ideas start with plain baked cupcakes or pound cake and go from there.Each design lists clearly the additional ingredients and adornments necessary to recreate the cupcakes shown in the photographs. Some of the most complicated looking designs are really quite easy to do. The instructions are clear and detailed and easy to follow, step-by-step.The designs included are cupcakes that look like mounds of spaghetti and meatballs, sunflower cupcakes, cupcakes that look like lattice-topped pies, fancy high-heeled shoes, and a herd of adorable sheep that use pound cakes rather than cupcakes with mini-marshmallows and other edible embellishments.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL5YN2TS1ZN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090OLFA6#wasThisHelpful","RKL5YN2TS1ZN3","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An apparent terrorist attack on a Florida nuclear electric generator plant is followed up by an attack on a scientist who has found a way to generate electricity from the Gulf Stream. The events draw ex-CIA director Kirk McGarvey into the investigation to find out how the attacks are related and who specifically would most benefit from the shut down of alternative energy sources.For anyone who has been following the fictional career of Kirk McGarvey, this latest installment of his adventures will not be a disappointment. The character seems to have gotten stuck in his mid-fifties, and despite the loss of his family in the previous book, is still at the top of his game. I do wonder though about all of the younger women who seem to find him irresistible.To those readers coming to this book without having read the earlier books in the series, you can still enjoy it as a stand-alone thriller, although the relationships and backgrounds of McGarvey and his CIA computer genius, Otto, would be clearer with the earlier books as a reference point.A clever and ruthless nemesis is introduced in the person of a South African mercenary, Brian DeCamp. After reading many recent thrillers that center around terrorists and religious fanatics, it's refreshing to find a bad guy who is motivated by lots of cash rather than jihad or political radicalism. He's a complex character whose abilities make him a worthy opponent for McGarvey.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U1OT6XS8ZU8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765324105#wasThisHelpful","R2U1OT6XS8ZU8S","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the very least I thought that a book claiming to offer ""new, unique and original"" names for pets would give something more than seemingly endless lists of mostly unpronounceable nonsense syllables.The lists of names are presented with a border of pink or blue so you can tell if they are meant for a female or male pet. Of course, if you are reading the book on an eink reader, you will be unable to distinguish the border or font colors.These ""names"" offer no origins or meanings of the proposed names. There is not even a guide for pronouncing some of the stranger combinations of letters and syllables. Do these ""names"" come from any languages, myths, or countries in particular? How does one pronounce ""AFYSYA"" or ""UNSFERE"" or ""FEGYAL"" or ""SYNAAL""?Do yourself and your new pet a favor and skip the ""names"" suggested in this book. If you really are having a difficult time picking a meaningful name for your cat that matches his or her personality, I would recommend looking in a book of baby names (the kind meant for humans) that lists the origin and meanings of each name. The name you choose will have to last your pet a lifetime. Don't hang an unpronounceable ""name"" of unknown origins on the poor kitty that you both will regret.Not recommended.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ANWSJCGTAJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4XRI72#wasThisHelpful","R18ANWSJCGTAJF","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got several laptop bags around that I've obtained during my career, but I needed a new larger bag for my wide-screen laptop. This bag is wide enough to accommodate my 16+ inch laptop without a struggle to get it in and out of the main compartment. I also borrowed a 17.3 inch wide laptop model to try in the bag which was the size that this bag claims to fit. The larger laptop fits, again with a minimum of maneuvering to slide it into the main compartment.Overall this is a good quality, well constructed bag with sturdy stitching and good padding around both the main laptop section and the outer zippered accessory compartment. The accessory compartment has a zippered area across the width of the pocket to store papers or other thin, flat items, two open slots for pens or pencils, and three open top flat pockets for small accessories such as an iPod cable, cell phone cable, or earbuds.Where most other laptop bags would have a large, unpadded pocket in the main compartment for file folders or papers, this bag has an additional padded pocket to accommodate another device such as a tablet or Kindle ereader. I tried my Kindle Keyboard with and without its case, and it fit just fine. Another item that will fit in this pocket is a USB device such as an external floppy drive, DVD drive, or hard drive.There is even a small outside zippered pocket on the opposite side of the accessory compartment that would be a nice place to park your cell phone or MP3 player. This small pocket is nicely padded too.The handles are padded and comfortable when carrying the loaded bag. A shoulder strap that can be snapped onto the bag is included.So what improvements do I think can be made to this bag?The laptop's AC adapter and cords are easily the bulkiest laptop accessory most people need to carry. The depth of the gusset around the accessory area needs to be increased by about an inch so that the bulk of the adapter and cords can better be accommodated without the lumps and bulges that will, over time, degrade the padding of the zippered outer flap.The other change I would make is to the size of the flat pockets within the accessory area. By changing where the stitching is for each pocket, one pocket could be made large enough to hold a thin DVD/CD jewel case securely. This would make the other two pockets slightly smaller, but still of usable sizes for small items such as charging cords. To make these pockets even more versatile, each one could be made with pleated edges instead of stitched flat against the lining; then they could hold slightly bulkier items such as flash drives instead of being limited to relatively flat items.If I could give a half-star, this bag would receive a 4.5 stars rating. It's a very good bag, just not quite perfect.Recommended for the wider-than-average laptops.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WMYJH3MSZCCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QV7WM6#wasThisHelpful","R2WMYJH3MSZCCW","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you only have room on your shelf for one book on cupcake baking, this would book be your best choice. It has all you need to know to get started baking and decorating all sorts of cupcakes for everyday or special occasions. The book is packed with detailed and close-up photographs to illustrate techniques and finished products to serve as inspiration to the home baker.The book takes the reader by the hand and starts out with the basics of needed equipment, items for decorating your baked cupcakes, and how best to store or freeze various types of frosted and unfrosted cupcakes.One feature that many of these recipes share is the option to make from scratch or to start with a boxed cake mix. For those pressed for time, this can be an important bonus feature.There are many options and types of frostings to be mixed-and-matched with the various cupcake flavors. Nutritional information is listed for both cupcakes and frostings, each given separately so whatever combination of flavors you come up with can be calculated easily, if needed.Most of the recipes for cupcakes make 24 standard sized cupcakes. Unfortunately many of these recipes call for an odd number of eggs or egg whites which makes halving the recipes a bit more tricky if you only want to bake a dozen. Hint: If you need to halve a recipe calling for three eggs, the most accurate way to solve the problem would be to use a kitchen scale to weigh the beaten eggs on a scale, then use only half of the weight for your current recipe, then save the other half of the beaten eggs for another use. Perhaps for an omelet for lunch?What types of cupcake flavors are there? To list a few: the standard white, yellow, and chocolate, Lemon, Orange Soda, Chocolate Whoopie Pie, Dried Cherry and Pistachio, Malted Milk Ball, Gingerbread, Double Coconut, and Strawberry Colada.And what flavors of frostings? A few to get your mouth watering: Chocolate Cream, Vanilla Buttercream, Orange Buttercream, Peanut Butter Buttercream, Cherry Nut, Maple Nut, Fluffy Butterscotch, Fluffy Peppermint, Cream Cheese, and Browned-Butter Buttercream.Roughly half the book is given over to ways to decorate your cupcakes you've created using recipes from the first half of the book. Decorating ideas range from the simple swirled frosting with sprinkles to more complex creations such as Chocolate Moose Cupcakes with pretzels for the antlers, an array of Princess cupcakes including one with a frog, several ideas for Halloween, an Easter Basket complete with tiny eggs and a bunny, and a stacked double-decker Fireworks Tower that uses both a regular sized cupcake with a mini cupcake to create a fountain effect for the frosting and decorations. My personal favorite decoration idea is the Cupcake Slider that has been dressed up to look like a small cheeseburger complete with faux lettuce and ketchup.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IL8KI7B553YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTOTYME#wasThisHelpful","R1IL8KI7B553YS","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone starting out in home baking or wanting to increase their confidence in their skills, this book starts out by explaining the basics of equipment, tools, and ingredients before getting into a discussion of techniques. The emphasis is on ""how to"" and ""with what"" to give the reader a good understanding of terms used in cooking and baking.This book is one of a series of First Timer's guides for various baking techniques. Each of them follow the same pattern of instruction. In fact, each of the books are basically the same only differing in the chapter containing the few recipes for the type of baking mentioned in the title.The list of tools and equipment may overwhelm a true beginner starting with an empty kitchen, but a bit of common sense (and perhaps a visit to your local thrift store) can cut this list down to a manageable size. Hint: One item I did not notice on the list, which I consider important to have when making biscuits or pie crusts, is a pastry cutter to cut the butter or shortening into the flour. In a pinch a pair of table knives held parallel to each other can be used as a substitute, but can be awkward to use. A pastry cutter is so much easier to use and is an inexpensive, low-tech item to add to your tool drawer. Not to mention less messy than using the ""rubbing"" method mentioned in this book.Ingredients are covered from eggs to types of flour to leavening agents and more. Substitutions are suggested for some of the items in case your pantry is missing an item for a recipe. Simple recipes for creating your own sour cream, caramel (which for some reason the author calls ""carmel""), and corn syrup are given, but I have not tried them and would wonder about the changes in taste and texture the homemade substitutions might make if used in a recipe.Techniques in mixing ingredients are covered briefly as is the why or science of how baking works.Recipes are given for Lemon Blueberry Muffins, a batter for pancakes or waffles, Zucchini Bread, and very rich, buttery biscuits. At the end of the book there are also a few topping recipes: whipped cream, lemon glaze, cinnamon sugar, and strusel.The remainder of the book contains information adjusting a recipe for high altitude and how to make adjustments to recipes for which you wish to halve or double the yields. There is an example of how to use baker's percentage based on weight instead of volume measurements (cups and teaspoons) as most home cooks use. The biscuit recipe listed earlier in the book is used as the example recipe given in baker's percentages with the arithmetic on how to transform this into a recipe that uses weight. This conversion can be confusing to even experienced bakers, so have your calculator and scales ready if you want to give the more professional method a try instead.Anyone looking for recipe cookbook rather than an instructional manual on baking basics should look elsewhere, but if you're just learning or trying to improve your existing skills, this would be a good place to start.Recommended for beginners and intermediate bakers looking for an instructional guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164PCFTOBRVIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANGJ1IS#wasThisHelpful","R164PCFTOBRVIB","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teenager Jess Williams returns to his parents' farm to find his family all brutally murdered. He knows the men who did it were the ones he had passed on the road to town, and swears that he will find them and avenge these deaths.From the brief description, the story sounds like so many others of revenge that have been told down the centuries, but what sells this Westernized version of the story is the main character. The youthful gunslinger is the key, like a John Wayne in training with a bit of Robin Hood thrown in as he tracks his family's murderers while finding plenty of other villains worth teaching a lesson along the way. He's a new old-time hero to follow as he journeys across the country on his mission of retribution.The bookends to the story that set up the provenance of the six shooter that Jess finds are Twilight Zone quality fantasy and can be ignored by the purists, but luckily the bulk of the book is just good rip-roaring Western justice.The mechanics of telling the tale are somewhat awkward when it comes to some of the dialog and punctuation, but since this is the first in a long series of books, hopefully these kinks will be worked out and in future installments. That's all that's keeping this one from earning that fifth star.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJSZWH2P99GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C5Z31Y#wasThisHelpful","RJJSZWH2P99GD","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Standard procedure requires that a courtesy phone call be made to inform a police officer when a prisoner he helped to arrest and convict is scheduled to be released from prison. Alex McKnight receives one of these calls from the Detroit PD telling him that Darryl King, a suspect he had arrested on one of his last cases, is being released. The news brings back a flood of memories, all bad, which prompts Alex to drive down to Detroit to try to put some of those memories to rest, but in doing so ends up with a new set of questions instead of closure.I've been hooked on this series since the first novels and usually prefer the stories that take place in the Upper Peninsula and surrounding areas. This book takes place on the Lower Peninsula, but offers an exciting and challenging mystery with enough twists and turns to make up for the change of venue.The story does an excellent job of pulling in the background that we have learned throughout the series about Alex McKnight and his character's sense of justice, and then using it to build a mission for him to find the truth behind what was supposed to have been a closed case.Aside from the mystery the important supporting character in the story is the City of Detroit, both before and after the economic collapse. I remember attending hockey games at the Olympia and driving by the old Tiger Stadium decades ago, and the references to those places brought back memories of good times. The sections that describe what these areas of the city have become make me glad that I haven't been back to ruin those good memories. For those not familiar with Detroit, these contrasts of before-and-after will be a revelation of just how far the city has fallen onto hard times.Read it for the mystery to solve, but also to understand better the disaster that has occurred to what was once one of the country's leading cities.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9KPR9A9L1QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312640226#wasThisHelpful","R3D9KPR9A9L1QA","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of us are use to having all of the modern conveniences in our kitchens, all powered by electricity. But what happens when the power fails?This book attempts to make some suggestions on how to add low tech, non-electric features to your kitchen just for such a power outage. It starts out with the basics such as having a good set of knives to replace your food processor and a manual can opener to use instead of the electric kind. But after a few common sense basics, the book loses its way after only a few pages.Telling the reader not to open the refrigerator or freezer during a power outage is more common sense advice, but no alternatives are suggested beyond recommending that you cook whatever is in there before it goes bad. And how are you supposed to cook them if the power is out and you've got an electric stove? According to the author, one option is an alcohol burner such as you might use with a fondue pot. Other suggestions include an outdoor wood fire or barbecue grill which must be used outside in a well ventilated area. That simply isn't a practical solution for most homes, especially if the cause of the power outage is a hurricane or ice storm, and it is certainly not practical for the quantity of food in most refrigerators and freezers. Even if you were to be able to cook that amount, how do you keep it from spoiling once cooked if there is no refrigeration available? The book offers no advice for that.The last portions of the book include a recipe book for soups and stews to ""cook in a crisis."" Over the wood fire, the reader must assume. Information is also included about dehydrating food for long-term storage, but the methods discussed all require a stove or appliance that require power.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E39OM6Z5DPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FSCVSI#wasThisHelpful","R2E39OM6Z5DPW","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Victorian era brings to mind honor, duty, and a steadfastness of character that is often called stuffy by those of later decades. The credit for this image should go not to Victoria herself, but to her consort, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. This book describes Albert's extraordinary intelligence and sense of duty and how those qualities were nurtured and trained by mentors and tutors for his future role as husband and advisor to the ruler of the world's most powerful empire.The author had unique access to letters written by the Prince Consort to his older brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and was able to interview three of the surviving children of Victoria and Albert in their later years all of which lends additional insight into the Prince Consort's character and motivations.The book covers the path that Victoria took to the throne, the manipulations those around her attempted to gain influence over the future queen, and the plans for her eventual marriage to her cousin, Albert. The pairing of the inexperienced and only partially educated queen with the intellectually curious, dutiful Albert was one that allowed the British Empire to thrive under his wise guidance and advice. His sponsorship of the Great Exhibition, patronage of artists and museums, restructuring of the military, and interest in the sciences all added to the growing legacy that would become the Victorian Era.The one area that I wish the book had covered more in-depth was the relationship the Prince Consort had with his children. There were nine children, but except for the Prince of Wales; Victoria, the Princess Royal; and Prince Alfred who later inherited the dukedom of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, there is barely a mention of the other children beyond noting each birth. Was the Prince Consort aware of the of hemophilia in the royal family that would be passed on through his children to royal families across Europe? The condition or his lack of awareness is never mentioned in this book.In all, this is a solid biography of Prince Albert's accomplishments that will give the reader a better understanding of just who was the driving force behind much of what was achieved in the British Empire during the Prince's marriage, and an inkling of how much different that era would have been without a man such as he filling the role as consort and advisor to the woman who ruled the most powerful empire in the world.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABPBKRJM07TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMBT0H8#wasThisHelpful","R3ABPBKRJM07TO","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Betsy Devonshire finds herself in the middle of another murder investigation when a body is found floating in the swimming pool facility she has been attending for water aerobics classes. How could a murderer access the locked building and pool? When one of her regular Crewel World customers begs her to help solve the puzzle, Betsy agrees to investigate.This mystery was a nice twist on the classic locked room mysteries. The clues are presented in such a way that the reader can solve the mystery along with Betsy, which is a feature I prefer to have in cozy mystery novels.The supporting characters who are regulars in this series are all present in this installment. Godwin, Jill, and the Monday Bunch members are all included, which is one of the things I enjoy most in these books. The supporting characters are like old friends from book to book and seem to grow as their lives move along with the years rather than remaining static and unchanging.That's not to say that this book cannot be read as a stand-alone mystery. It will be more enjoyable to those who already know the characters from previous books in the series, but the mystery itself does not suffer from not knowing these characters' backstories.Recommended as an enjoyable puzzle in an entertaining package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369KN0R2BZ1XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270084#wasThisHelpful","R369KN0R2BZ1XA","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my! There goes the diet.For anyone who has wanted to try their hand at making their own truffles, this book offers some very good advice and instructions on how to best approach the project. It has suggestions on the best technique for forming the candies, melting the chocolate, and which ingredients make the best truffles. The instructions for each recipe are written in a clear and easily understandable style.This recipes include a nice combination of familiar truffles such as Dark Chocolate, White Chocolate Almond, and Parisian Chocolate Truffles, and a number of unusual flavors such as Chocolate Vegetarian Pumpkin, White Chocolate Apricot Hazelnut, and Strawberry Truffles.Several of the recipes feature liqueurs as flavorings for the truffles. For some reason the author placed photographs of liqueur bottles and product packages among the recipes where photographs of the actual truffles would have been more useful. At times the oddly-placed bottle photographs disrupt the flow of the recipe, so I hope in the next revision of the book, these might be removed to improve the readability of the text. The photographs are a nuisance rather than a deal-breaker.Recommended for non-dieters and chocolate lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGD8XQFKZUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6HXF6Y#wasThisHelpful","RQGD8XQFKZUA","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner Brothers Studios produced a string of cookie-cutter popular detective series back in the late 1950s and into the 1960s that mainly differed in the locale of each show. One of these was ""Hawaiian Eye,"" set in Honolulu, but filmed in California. WB's musical director, Warren Barker, was in charge of music for most of their television shows, including this one.The show featured a hotel lounge, The Shell Bar, as a device to include a bit of music in between the detecting. These segments usually featured Connie Stevens and occasionally Poncie Ponce who both had regular co-starring roles in the series. Both performers have a track on this CD. Miss Stevens' does a sweet, light version of Cole Porter's classic ""Let's Do It."" Poncie Ponce does a very nice ""When My Dream Boat Comes Home"" complete with ukulele.The one sore thumb on the CD is the track ""You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me"" sung by series star Robert Conrad. He tries very hard, but his voice is better suited to a shower stall or at-home parties, especially when compared with the much more musically talented Mr. Ponce's contribution to the CD.The rest of the CD is taken up with two versions of the show's theme song and a sampler of some incidental music used in the show.The liner notes are extremely sparse, only one page of general background about the show and the music. I would have liked to have seen more information included in these notes and perhaps a few photographs of the stars.Recommended only for those who were fans of the show looking for some memories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4SPF0WPDEIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FAOBZK#wasThisHelpful","RO4SPF0WPDEIR","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kimmy and her best friend Jess suddenly find themselves homeless just days before Christmas. With some fast talk and quick thinking, they land themselves jobs as house sitters in the upper crust part of town. It's a dream come true for Kimmy who dotes on celebrities and fancy cooking. But the ideal surroundings are marred by what seems to be a malevolent spirit determined to get them out of the house as soon as possible.This was a fun story based around very likable characters, although I must admit that Kimmy's addition to the pop celebrity world at times wore a bit thin. Most of those references flew right over my head, since they were UK-centric as was much of the slang which I could not parse into any form of English with which I'm familiar.What seems to be a light-hearted holiday story actually has several layers besides the two almost-homeless young ladies and their initial troubles.There is an element of romance as Kimmy pines at first for her boyfriend Adam who had asked her to leave their apartment because she wouldn't settle down into his idea of a stable future, then later as she is attracted to Luke, the handyman for the house they are minding. But there is a deeper meaning behind these attractions as Kimmy starts to realize as it dawns on her that one expects her to put aside her dreams and ambitions for a more practical life while the other is urging her to use her talents to pursue her dreams of success.Another layer of the story deals with Kimmy's celebrity worship as she sees first hand what celebrities have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. The paparazzi, the malicious gossip, and the less than perfect lives they really live come home to her as she befriends a neighbor in the upscale development.Wrap all of these elements up in a bit of a mystery of the apparent hauntings, inventive cupcake flavors, and a bevy of unique and sympathetic characters, and you've got a very engaging story for a cold winter's evening.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDJ6SVFM67K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O56X3HM#wasThisHelpful","R1DDJ6SVFM67K9","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lt. Dekker and Sgt. Murdock are again called out of their semi-retirement when a woman is found dead in her full-service apartment. Several factors are causing problems with the investigation because of the locked apartment door, the timing of meals, and the apparent time of death. Dekker and Murdock leave no mound of gravy un-turned as they search for the answers.I find this Dekker-Murdock series of cozy mysteries to be very frustrating. The quality of the mystery in each book varies so greatly from book to book I'm never sure what I'll be getting each time I start to read one. This one falls into the disappointing category with the emphasis on the running jokes of Dekker's immense appetite and Murdock's relationship with his Wii Fit rather than weaving a tight mystery.I also found the motive for the murder rather thin and unconvincing, and some of the actions of the murderer were confusing and not well explained at the time of the big reveal.I'll keep reading the books in this series as I come upon them since some are very well told with solid, solvable murder mysteries plus a touch of humor, and I enjoy the cast of characters. I wouldn't want to take the chance of missing one of the real winners just to avoid a possible disappointment from one of the lesser mysteries.Recommended only for fans of the series in order to keep up with the characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMNA2AEVT5J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COAKA7C#wasThisHelpful","R3PMNA2AEVT5J6","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A young woman pulls a daredevil stunt by jumping off the tallest mountain peak in South America. Fitted out in a special suit and vaguely heart-shaped parachute, she rides the wind currents for a wild and dangerous ride.Even putting aside the technical problems behind a stunt such as described in this short story, there still wasn't much here that made sense. Important details such as the ""why"" of the stunt were missing. Just as a lark perhaps? There really wasn't much to the story, and whatever point the author was trying to make with it, if any, wasn't clear.It only takes a few minutes to read, but gives the reader little reward for the time invested.

"This add-on to the 6 cup Aroma rice cooker makes it easy and efficient to cook vegetables with the same appliance as the rice, saving both energy and clean up time.Before I purchased the rice cooker and this steamer insert, I'd have to use two burners on my stove to cook my rice and steam my vegetables for a meal. It also meant that there were two pots to clean as well. With this steamer, I can have my rice cooking in the bottom portion of the appliance and then add my vegetables to this steamer tray freeing up my stove top and using only one plug-in appliance's worth of electricity instead and smaller items to be washed up after it's finished.As a bonus, using this steamer tray on the rice cooker even when not using it for cooking additional items will keep the Mt. Vesuvius effect of the rice cooker to a minimum. Since there is a ""buffer zone"" of a couple of inches of head space provided by the steamer tray between the cooking rice and the lid, less spraying, steamy water is ejected from the rice cooker. Less spray, less clean up around the cooker. Even if you don't need this steamer tray for its designed purpose of steaming foods, it's worth buying just to keep the rice cooker from spitting up all over your clean counter top.The handles are attached to the steamer tray with screws rather than the cheaper method of spot welding that can loosen or be broken off over time. The use of screws means that if the handles become loose, they can easily be tightened back up. It also means that for cleaning if necessary, the handles can be removed entirely, the unit cleaned, then the handles re-attached.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8ETTT3NI4S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2QDBQG#wasThisHelpful","R1U8ETTT3NI4S4","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The role of an enforcer in hockey is to protect his more skilled teammates from getting injured. The role of an enforcer in a criminal organization is to keep the other mob members and customers of the criminals in line, often resorting to brutal force when necessary. Connor Dunsmore finds himself filling both roles when he signs on to play hockey in a very minor professional league when the owner of his team hires him to do extra work outside the rink. Connor soon finds himself in a deep hole which may well end up being his grave.I picked up this book because I'm a big hockey fan. It doesn't matter what level or league, I'll watch it whenever I have a chance. It's a good thing I'm also a big fan of hard-boiled thrillers, because that is what this book is, in spades.Connor is given a backstory of having suffered a near-death on-ice injury just before his draft year which ruined his chances to become a star in the NHL. This accident and the other player involved in it is woven into the book through recurring nightmares that join with the horrors he has seen occur during his sideline job with the mob. The spiral downward into the more grisly aspects of mob assignments pulls at Connor more deeply as the nightmares become more intense, yet the character still comes across as a good guy the reader can sympathize with as he becomes entrapped by the evil of his boss, Mr. Ojacarcu.Other notable characters are Connor's girlfriend Dana, his rescue project Jera, and his sometimes friend, sometimes antagonist Petre. Lurking in the darkest of places is the evil character Dracul who probably even frightened his mother when he was born, and the head of the local mob, Mr. Ojacarcu, each with their own unique backstories in Romania.This is not for the weak of stomach or the easily offended by rough language and situations. It's tough and hard-nosed, but the payoff is a terrific story.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7OYO7KXBLHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT1DLNA#wasThisHelpful","R2K7OYO7KXBLHR","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I should admit that I had never heard of Marcella Hazan before I picked up this book to read. I'm not a fan of Italian food and had no idea who she was or why she might be enough of a celebrity to be writing a book about her life.I was drawn into the book by the descriptions of Marcella's life in Italy before, during, and directly after World War II. There are many memoirs about the Blitz in England and similar stories of life during the war that are based in various areas of the rest of Europe, but I had never read any about rural Italy and how the people coped during the war, so this was a very welcome surprise.The rest of the book traces how once married and settled into domestic life, Marcella had to learn to cook based on her memories of the foods she enjoyed growing up. I found it fascinating that she had not learned to cook as a child and it was only upon becoming a homemaker she finally began to learn to apply these memories into practical recipes and meals. Even more fascinating was how this grew by chance into a teaching and cookbook writing career. It's a riff on the ""immigrant makes good"" stories we've all heard.No, there are no recipes included in the book, but there are many photographs from a life well lived that range from small town Italy to world travels to celebrities who have attended Marcella's cooking classes.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3JER2R1D6J2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592403883#wasThisHelpful","R3O3JER2R1D6J2","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attorney Don Tremain has just left one corporate job to join another, newer corporation, Caldera Geothermal, that specializes in alternative energy sources. He's hoping that this new gig will be just what he needs to revive his career path that had stalled out at his old job. What he doesn't realize is that his new company has become the target of a group of unscrupulous vulture investors who have begun a systematic approach to ruining Caldera by using any and all methods necessary, including bribery, insider trading, and even murder.This book was an education in the legal ins-and-outs of the corporate world and bankruptcy as well as a high-powered thriller with a lot of action. I can easily picture this on the big screen with all of the dirty tricks, car chases, corporate moles, and an assortment of suave and sleazy bad guys. No doubt the movie version would leave out the educational legalistic portions of the story, but those are the backbone of the plot and need to be there in order to make some sense of what's happening to Caldera. It does make for some heavy sledding at times, but it's worth the trouble to understand how the system can be gamed to the benefit of the unscrupulous.The main character, Don, often seems to be the only one with any integrity or loyalty as he becomes buried under the work load of trying to keep his corporation afloat.

"A young woman's body has been found in an isolated cave, but rather than calling the police, the leaders of the community call in a medical student, Jacob Christianson, they feel they can trust to determine the cause of her death. This is a closed community populated by a splinter sect of polygamists who prefer to keep the authorities out of their business. But what if this trusted investigator determines that the cause of death was murder? Will the elders cover up the crime or allow justice to be served?The murder mystery is a gritty, hard boiled one as is the ensuing search for the truth behind the reasons for the crime and the perpetrator. I really liked the character of Jacob with his calm demeanor and willingness to question those in authority in the community despite his age and lack of official standing. His sister Eliza was also a character who the reader gets to know and care about as she acts as her brother's eyes and ears within the women's sections of the farms and residences.This book contains a lot of disturbing material. Not only are the details of the crime grizzly and horrifying, the settings and attitudes in the polygamist communities are difficult to digest. The idea of women being treated as possessions and regarded as breeding stock in the 21st Century United States and Canada is repugnant to me and was disturbing to read about even in fiction that is loosely based on some isolated realities. There is also a lot of information not usually available to non-Mormons about the details of temple rituals, many of which seemed somewhat reminiscent of Masonic rites and mysteries to me.All in all, the mystery and Jacob's relentless investigation that sold this book for me. The unfamiliar surroundings and details about the polygamist towns gave it an almost voyeuristic feel and made for some of the twists of the plot that made the last half of the book a real page turner.Recommended, but would not be suitable for those who have a weak stomach or who cannot handle the polygamist angles of the plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUM92AM1T4YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612182186#wasThisHelpful","R3MUM92AM1T4YI","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book would be of no use at all to a beginner wanting to learn how to knit. It is not ""easy,"" ""complete,"" or a ""Guide To Creating Amazing Patterns"" as the subtitles claim. It accomplishes none of these claims. Anyone trying to use this book as their only method of learning the processes of knitting would find the lack of detail and clarity in the text frustrating.There are no diagrams, illustrations, or photographs to demonstrate any of the necessary techniques to cast on, knit, purl, or cast off. The text that attempts to describe the processes of these basics isn't even clearly written and uses terms that are not defined or explained in any depth. Important basic topics are given minimal coverage, yet the book spends time on techniques and skills that would not be needed until the new knitter reaches an intermediate or advanced level all the while jumping from one topic to another with little logical organization or focus. An example of this would be the short section describing how to do a cast-on, then jumping to how to cast-off without first having the beginner learn the actual knitting part that goes in between the two: the knit stitch and the purl stitch.There is no discussion of even the basics of choosing appropriate yarn and needles for a beginning project beyond a mention that there are different kinds of yarn with different textures and weights. There is no mention of what any of these are or what differences there might be or how it would effect the results of a knitting project. There is no suggestion of how to choose the correct size needle for various weights of yarns and yarn types.In addition there are no patterns given, not even for a simple beginner's scarf. Certainly there is no guide here for a beginner to help in creating any sort of patterns much less amazing ones.There are many more useful, well-written ebooks to help beginners learn how to knit. I would recommend that those wishing to learn take a look at How to Knit for Beginners: 9 Free Tutorials eBook by Prime Publishing, The Beginners Guide to Knitting: Learn How To Knit The Easy Way by Lilly Jones, or the (3 BOOK BUNDLE) ""Beginners Handbook of Knitting Stitches"" and "" How to Knit Scarves"" and ""How to Knit Socks"": Learn How to Knit Quick and Easy knitting series written by Chloe Thompson. All of these books contain close-up photographs and diagrams plus detailed step-by-step instructions for each part of the knitting process. Any of these would be more likely to help a beginning knitter learn the needed skills for successful results and to start off with an enjoyable hobby with fewer frustrations and misunderstandings of essential techniques.Not recommended.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FU3U84HFG56U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU6WIIK#wasThisHelpful","R1FU3U84HFG56U","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quiet summer weekend becomes an effort to survive when the metro Seattle area is hit by a major earthquake. Rescue efforts swing into action, aided by a network of ham radio operators and a mysterious helicopter whose owners have their own agenda.The prime focus of this book is the devastating effects that would be caused by a major earthquake, especially in the downtown and surrounding areas. There is also a parallel story line about the search for a long-missing person by a detective agency that seems to be bolted onto the earthquake and recovery action simply as a device to explain the presence of the agency's team and helicopter in Seattle at the time of the earthquake.I have never had the pleasure of visiting the Seattle area, so I can offer no opinion on the accuracy of the descriptions of the downtown area or surrounding terrain, but I am an amateur radio operator, so I feel qualified to comment on the major plot device concerning the emergency radio net that helped in the recovery effort. The activity described in the book is fairly representative of the types of radio traffic handled during emergencies by amateur radio networks and their volunteer operators. Perhaps reading these fictional accounts of what real radio amateurs do during emergencies will motivate some readers to investigate more about this useful hobby. I do have a major nit to pick about proper protocol though that was glossed over in the story. A net control operator cannot simply identify herself as ""Net Control"" constantly while handling traffic, but is required by regulations to use her call sign and to identify by that at least every ten minutes. Ironically one ham operator character was called out by another character for not identifying himself properly on a check-in, so that made the net controller's oversight even more obvious.The mystery of the missing person that was a sub plot in the book was very contrived and a rushed explanation at the end of the book of why the person had chosen to go missing was unsatisfying and confusing. It seemed as though it was an afterthought that was quickly wrapped up with little regard to whether any of it was well explained or logical. The book would have been better to have been separated into two books, one a disaster scenario of the earthquake where the detective team just happened to be caught and helped with rescues, and a second book that could have been about the missing woman and her background and could have been developed in an more orderly manner.Editing of the book could have used some improvement, especially in the over-use of capitalizations. Amateur radio operators, net control, dentist, and many other terms and titles used in the book are not proper nouns and should not have been capitalized. There were so many of these it got to be an irritating distraction to the flow of the story.In spite of the shortcomings, I'm giving the book four stars. Raising readers' awareness of the importance of being prepared for this and other types of emergency situations is a major reason for the rating plus there were many characters in it worth following in their struggle to get out of the danger zone safely and to survive. Yes, the book could use some cleanup and some improvements, but the basics of a good story are still in there and worth the reader's time.Mildly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JOKGO3D265UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XKNEOS#wasThisHelpful","R3JOKGO3D265UW","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Negative campaign ads, dirty dealing, and sometimes even murder. Any tactic is fair game to capture the prize of a congressional seat or even the White House. Political campaign consultant Frank Miles finds out the hard way just how far some of his clients and their opponents will go when one of his partners is found dead in his office and campaign files are missing.This book has the elements of both a murder mystery and a complex political thriller. There is a peek into the world of political campaign advertising and spin, but the main focus is the tracking down of a political operative who has been committing murders, and following the leads to find who is pulling the strings for the cover-ups.There are plenty of characters to keep up the reader's interest including the main character Frank Miles, failed political candidate Ozzie Olson, and a pair of DC police detectives Randolph and Grimes. There are plenty of bad guys around as well, including an elusive killer and less-than-ethical politicians and their minions.

It's not that the story was written for laughs, it's just that the whole setup of the cops versus DEA agents versus the drug lords leaves the reader shaking his head at the seeming incompetence of the ones supposed to be the good guys. There is a lot of action going on in the story, but to little effect.Mildly recommended only as a quick distraction rather than as an engaging mystery or thriller.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R194SNTDN81UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHLPD7S#wasThisHelpful","R194SNTDN81UZ","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The news is controlled by the government with only a limited number of approved television and radio networks allowed to operate and only disseminating approved content. A piece of highly damaging information about the current federal administration is passed along to a former highly popular news anchor, Brian Everett, who now needs to find a way to get this information out to the public ahead of the coming election. The President's staff will stop at nothing to prevent that from happening.This book paints a picture of a United States that is controlled by a number of amoral people in positions of power. Luckily it also contains characters who are willing to fight the status quo, who still remember the guarantees specified in the Constitution, and are also willing to put their lives on the line when it matters.The reader is taken on a wild ride back and forth across the country as the baton of information is passed along with merciless agents hot on the trail as the puppet masters control the search from Washington. Even if political conspiracies aren't your thing, this story is also a fast-paced, page-turner of an adventure thriller, and should appeal to anyone who enjoys the old spy thriller type of tale as well.On another level, this story is one of the people who put their lives and careers on the line to do what they know is right regardless of personal gain or loss. The duty and personal integrity of one set of characters battles the cruelty, greed, and overpowering desire for power of the other set which makes for a classic good versus evil morality tale.For those who have read the author's other political thriller, The Blood of Tyrants, please note that this novel is not a sequel of that book; this book takes place in a different setting and with new characters.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLTTMVA0O87L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PJ7AWE#wasThisHelpful","R2RLTTMVA0O87L","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The First Family is having issues; the First Lady Rebecca Gordon Tufts has received a blackmail note from her husband's mistress demanding a half million dollars in hush money. Not trusting members of the White House staff to deliver the money and keep quiet, she asks an old friend, retired policeman Dan Powers to come to DC to take care of the job as a personal favor.It's rare to find a book where almost every character presented is someone with no redeeming features, but this book manages to turn that trick. The only character the reader can actually cheer for is Dan Powers who ends up being the whipping boy for almost every one else in the story no matter which way he turns.The story itself is complex with a lot of twists, turns, and surprises with Powers using his experience as a big city detective to follow the clues and sort out these bad guys from the other bad guys. He suffers being shot, beat up, lied to, and betrayed by just about everyone yet he keeps on the case to root out the truth and identify the ultimate culprit amongst a whole cast of culprits.The real problems with the book are in the execution of the plot and the mechanics of story telling. There are many grammatical and typographical errors in the book which increase in number as the book progresses, as though the proofreader or editor gave up halfway through the job.Another glaring error is a disconnected plot point that seems to have gotten lost between one draft of the book and the final version regarding an apparently abandoned subplot of a drug problem that Rebecca Tufts had at one time. The drug in question, Librium, was mentioned twice as though the reader should already know the backstory and the character's relationship with it and how it caused another problem to occur, yet there is no such subplot to explain it. An editor should have caught this and corrected the problem either by omitting the references or directing the author to insert an explanation of the references possibly by restoring the original subplot to the book.The timeframe of the book is also a problem. There are hints in the text that make it seem to take place in a time just after the millennium without specifying the exact year, and yet there are technical points that would tend to indicate that it is not a present-day setting. There are mentions of a few popular personages such as Tom Brokaw and Oprah Winfrey to give it verisimilitude, but there are other details that make a major plot point difficult to believe if the story took place in a time after the year 2000. Information that would be common knowledge by that date and afterward was not known by the main character, and this lack of awareness put him at a disadvantage. I call foul since there is no way an experienced former detective would NOT have been aware of this specific fact and not have taken the necessary precautions to counteract it.The ending also is unsatisfying and incomplete with several plot resolutions left hanging.Not recommended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5Q0KTWLLA7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8RX5ZY#wasThisHelpful","R3L5Q0KTWLLA7I","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reporter Kat Archer is getting very tired of being assigned restaurant reviews for her newspaper, so she jumps at the chance to do an investigative piece when an anonymous caller asks her to meet him for a big breaking story. She gets more than she bargained for when she finds her informant dead at the meeting place. What was the information, and who killed the victim to keep him quiet?There are plenty of fun, likable characters introduced in this book, and each is a believable character rather than an exaggerated caricature as happens in many cozies.The book's mystery is actually two mysteries that are interwoven and makes for a complex set of relationships amongst the characters and possible suspects. There are lots of clues, lots of possibilities, and lots of possible perps to keep the reader off balance and sorting out the motives and and identity of the murderer or murderers.The one thing in the book that I found questionable as far as believability was that a small town could support not just one, but two daily newspapers. It's a minor suspension of belief the author asks the reader in which to indulge in return for a very engaging cast of characters and a challenging mystery.There is a sample of four chapters of Death by Pink Flamingo: A Pink Flamingo Hotel Mystery Book 1 (Hatter's Cove Mystery Series), a cozy mystery set in the same town as this book and featuring some of the same supporting characters.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZEPWOHYOYKX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICXDRCU#wasThisHelpful","RZEPWOHYOYKX4","AP6JFTL9C5BK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP6JFTL9C5BK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Decent story. Good action, intrigue and hero. Chance Thorne, good guy, hunting down bad guys. Story line kept my interest and the plot was not the typical shoot 'em up, ride off in the sunset. There was a Native American aspect to it that brought light to how they were cheated out of their hunting grounds.It didn't get a higher rating because the book needs an editor. There were too many phrases that felt forced to make it sound like the old west. Hotel rooms in 1869 Oregon would not have cost $26. Brood cow was highly overdone.

"I think I've found one of the worst books ever, or set of books or whatever it's marketed as. The books end at 59% on my Fire and then you get a freebie and some excerpts from other books. When I began reading the first story, it sounded familiar and about three pages in I realized it was offered as a stand alone and I already read it. Or make that tried to read it.If you set aside the above and look at the writing, it's awful. There is no character development, the story is all over the place, there's no background and it's not true to the period. For example, they did not call them a police force whenever this was supposed to have occurred. Add the many spelling errors and you have a really terrible book.I skimmed them all, which was easy since some pages had only four or five lines. I can't stress enough how bad the writing was.

"I'm obviously in the minority for not really liking these books. I read the prequel and although it very predictable, I was curious what the boys' stories were. They had too much of a modern feel to them for me. Even though the descriptions were of the time, I didn't get the feeling it was the late 1800s. I think it was the way they talked.I liked the boys, handsome, strong, cowboys but felt their mother was crazy, but she was described as caring and loving. She was overbearing, manipulative and controlling. I forgot which other woman was portrayed as weak and having to take to her bed when anything happened, maybe Grace's mom. I didn't care for either of them.There were many misused words sprinkled throughout. Finally, there is no book 1 that I can see. It goes from the prequel listed as 0 to book 2. In the description for book 3 Ashley's name is Adam. May not be a big deal to most, but shows lack of attention to detail.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZJW8G5JIEQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKQHLMM#wasThisHelpful","R2KZJW8G5JIEQ2","ASA5RSXOAVT12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASA5RSXOAVT12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well written, highly emotional story of intrigue and suspense set during the Civil War. It would have been a five star read but it dragged a bit at times and some of the scenarios were a little out there. I live in Northern VA and have visited many of the Civil War battlefields mentioned as well as the areas Cassie traveled. The historical aspect is highly accurate.The author gave the reader a glimpse of the tough life soldiers endured when injured. She was able to put the reader in the story with larger than life descriptions. I'll admit about half way through I had to read the epilogue to see how it turned out because it took an unexpected turn. Can't say more for fear of giving too much away.

Shanda Trofe writes with enthusiasm about how she has used it in her business and how others have been successful using this tool.In Chapter 1, Trofe gives a detailed overview of what Periscope is, its roots, and what it can do for my business.  I learned that I can use it to promote my products and services in a way that is more personal and defined.The following chapters takes you step-by-step through the process of downloading the app and preparing it for use, including the settings and credentials and such.  This book is a superior guide because it literally holds your hand throughout the whole process from:Getting viewersSetting up your cameraHow to handle trollsBroadcasting tipsAnd mistakes to avoidI recommend this book to anyone who wants to educate themselves in order to take their business to a more visible and lucrative level.

Installation of the battery was easy and it t took us a little less than and hour and a half to charge.

We really enjoyed using all four speeds and using the controls was a no-brainer.  The ducks on the pond didn't know what to do (no harm came to the ducks during our play).  The other kids were so excited and interested that they just had to know where we bought this speedy little boat from.  We even had a man come over an inquire about it as well because he said it looked like we were having too much fun.This is a nice toy that I think is wonderful for any fun-loving kids and adults alike.

The test strips for both tests read fast and clearly, and you don't have to urinate a ton to get an accurate result.  The enclosed instructions are simple to read and follow, so they is no room for human error and you can do this in the privacy of your own bathroom.The amount that you receive is great for those who, like myself, have irregular menstrual cycles.

"I read book analyses and companions because they always give me a better understanding of the book and more insight into things like symbols and motifs, which I seem to totally suck at recognizing.  To Kill a Mockingbird has been one of my favorites ever since I read it in middle school.  It is one of the greatest pieces of literature, but I never really grasped its true meaning.To Kill a Mockingbird AfterRead has helped me get a deeper and clearer understanding of this prolific novel.  What I liked about this book analysis is that is uniquely looks at specific parts of the book such as:- Possible Storyline for a Prequel- The Evolution of Rape Law in the USWhat really got me thinking was the chapter titled, ""Imagining Alternate Endings"" in which it provokes deeper thought.  Like, ""...what if they found the defendant Tom Robinson not guilty?"" or what if Tom were left-handed instead of being cripple?I know I have more clarity into a book that I have loved for decades and I recommend this book to anyone that may be in a book club, a fan, or even a student.

"I started my spiritual journey over two years ago and although I have growth and learned quite a bit, I know there is still much to be attained.  This is the very reason why I purchased The Art of Living, because there are no accidents in this Universe because when the student (myself) is ready, the teacher (Kelly Ashley in this case) always appears.My daily meditations often seek the guidance of my angels and/or spirit guides and as Ashley experienced in her own journey, she did not know the meaning of some of the messages that were related.  Ashley's account into her spiritual journey has lit yet another light unto my feet along my path.  I really liked how she presented her experience in a conversational manner, it made the reading flow so that I could really ascertain.In Chapter One, when she says, ""I've wanted to have someone to talk to.  I've wanted to have someone to guide me, and above all I've wanted to believe that I'm not alone.""

"Jackson is back at it again with another book crammed with all the things I love about romance novels, except with ""When a Taker Dreams,""  it kicks thing up a notch quite a bit.Cierra is character that has a common dilemma that many women have and that is finding Mr. Right.  Her mom, Ada, is like many moms wanting her daughter to find security first and worry about the love later.  With this kind of pressure, Cierra decides to take a leap of faith with a wickedly sexy man named Ryker that ""seems"" to be up to no good.No spoliers here, but this tales get better by the chapter and before you know it, you are caught up in a whirlwind of hot lust, passion, desire, danger, a bit of humor, and best of all intrigue.I thoroughly enjoy Jackson's novels because her characters and story lines are so relateable and the plots are beautifully twisted.  If you love novels that keep you wanting more, then check out this one...it'll leave your fingers steaming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXCT8SSMOG3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01288VA7I#wasThisHelpful","RUXCT8SSMOG3Z","A2NR75GMH2BB3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NR75GMH2BB3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a son that is about to start applying for his first job, so I thought a book like this would help guide him on this journey that can be quite daunting.  I run a business from my home and do not have much experience with applying for jobs, so I was delighted to see that this book details every aspect of how to get a job in 30 days or less.This book is good for those who may be new to the job market (such as my son) or those who may have been out of work quite a while.  I found the most helpful chapters of the book to be:- Top 3 Mistakes Job Seekers Make- 3 Key Steps to Get a Job- How to Set Job Goals & Develop Your Plan- How to Write and Format an Effective Resume & Cover LetterThis book has helped put the job market in perspective for my son and I was glad to be able to read through this book with him.

"Talking about pulling an all-nighter...this book had me up until the wee hours of the morning, untangling this tantalizing tale of betrayal and deceit.  Deception is the name of this game and Jackson wasted no time laying out a well-written plot that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  His development of characters like Nicholas, Lacey, Kienan and others was a reflection of the level of talent Jackson has in his literary art.I do not write spolier reviews, but if you like intrigue, suspense, seduction, betrayal, drama, and complexity, then Lovers, Players, and the Seducer is a must read.

"I use fresh dried herbs in my cooking, but I usually used kitchen shears to cut up the herbs to make my own spice/herb combinations for my dishes.  The blades are very sharp (be warned) and grinds herbs with magnificent ease. The result are herbs ground to the consistency comparable to herbs bought in a store. While grinding, I did not have to make the extra effort to keep the device together to prevent spillage, due to the magnetized closure...big plus in my book.  What I really liked about this product was that it has three chambers in which the herbs are ground, so I was able to use this on both fresh and dried herbs.  And the scraper included in very efficient and effective when it comes to gathering the resin or pollen.  The scraper gets right into all of the grooves and nooks and crannies.A great investment for anyone who relishes in fresh ground herbs.

" 3:43 Mins The Euro Spa LED Shower Head is a great addition to any home.  What I liked about this product from the start was that it will keep your children (and loved ones) from getting scalded in the shower using some pretty cool LED lights.  This can be especially helpful if you have gas water heater.  Installation was super easy and it comes with everything you need to have it hooked up in less than 10 minutes.  My son found this shower head to be highly entertaining...I had to drag him out of the shower.  The shower head turns red when the water is too hot and blue when the water is cool.  It also turns green when the water is nice and warm.For those who live in areas where the water is hard, this shower head included a filter that filters out all those icky impurities, leaving your skin soft.  There's no need to buy batteries, because this bad boy is powered by hydro (water) and the LED lighting lasts for ten years (or 100,000)...that's amazing.I highly recommend this product to anyone that:1.  Has children2.  Has an elderly loved one3.  Needs help gauging the temp of the water before entering the shower.Two thumbs up and a mother's glowing recommendation to a product that allows you to say, ""good-bye"" to scalding showers.***This product was gifted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2L7RULFU8X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0104E716C#wasThisHelpful","R3A2L7RULFU8X8","A2NR75GMH2BB3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NR75GMH2BB3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Could not -get enough- of the sonic opener ""In 0"" as well as the awesome ""In Z"" or the wonderful ..... simply ambient / searing psychedelic closer ""In Infinity"". Duration: 74 minutes. Don't believe I've ever seen a CD like this one - with four tracks + all four clocking in at just over the eighteen-minute mark. Couldn't help but to notice that 'In 0 To Infinity' is rather a dark album - plus it possesses a good electronic drone vibe. A bit different than all the other -numerous- Acid Mothers titles out there. Maybe that's why I haven't heard many fans mention this particular AMT disc - when the subject comes up.

Also was able to thoroughly enjoy the tripping ""Benzaiten / Reprise Benzaitenshu"" [written by the previously mentioned Kitajima Osamu]- perhaps the CD's best track, at least in my opinion.

Tunes here that I thought made this ~experimental psych~ CD worthy of purchasing were the eight-minute ass-kicking [psych] opener ""Black Bouquet"", the somewhat inspiring ""The Lamp - Tomorrow's Goddard"", the jamming ""Yellow Sea"", ""1997"", ""Nude And Bizarre"" and the earlier recorded (from a '97 gig) live version of ""Black Bouquet"" - personally I like it better than the first edit - which is from a live LSD March performance.

"Definitely, The Black's lengthiest CD offering - clocking in at 77 minutes but then again, it is a 2-on-1 where we get two of the Italian doom metal band's lp's on a single CD - 'Peccatis Nostris' and 'Capistrani Pugnator' (see my review of the lp edition). Both titles were released in 2004. As for 'Peccatis Nostris' (English translation: Our Sins), I got the most out of the bootie-stomping opener ""Pigritia"" (obviously a strong Black Sabbath influence present), the rocking eight-minute ""Superbia"", ""Luxuria"", the heavy and [truly] inspiring ""Gula"" and the well-played seven-minute ""Ira"". Healthy dose of prime Italian doom metal. An absolute must-have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SONOXZTZ4IZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002N8SMM#wasThisHelpful","R1SONOXZTZ4IZ4","A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's a title by those Italian doom metal merchants - The Black - that I initially was not even aware of. Believe it is available on vinyl lp only. Tunes here that definitely managed to lure me into the band's realm as to what they're all about were the cool instrumental opener ""Kardiophylax"", the eight-minute (stunning) ""Praetutii"", ""Miserere"" and the ass-kicking fifteen-minute title track ""Capistrani Pugnator"" - in which happens to take up the entire side two of the album. Through out all five of this lp's foundation-rattling cuts, I for one really dug the several fine instrumental segments that definitely add something great to this must-have lp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE9UC2FPJD44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QOF1QO#wasThisHelpful","RJE9UC2FPJD44","A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually had the privilege of experiencing Huw Lloyd Langton playing live here in the Midwest when he was support for Nektar and Brainticket on the historic 'Space Rock Invasion Tour' a couple of summers ago. Personally, I got more out of disc one - with his two re-working of a couple of Hawkwind gems - ""Rocky Paths"" and the (always, great to hear) ""Hurry On Sundown"" as well as a handful of his tunes from his two lesser-known post-Hawkwind bands he was in - Magill ('73) and Jawa ('79) with Nic Potter and Simon King. Also dug his cover of a tune we all know from Eric Burdon ""Don't Let Me Be Understood"". Disc two is nearly as good - with all instrumentals  which gives us -key- tracks from his 'Night Air', 'Chain Reaction' and 'Hard Graft' CD's as well as six all-new acoustic tunes. An astounding two-and-a-half hour piece of the late Hawkwind / Widowmaker / Lloyd Langton Group guitarist work to thoroughly enjoy and remember him by. Definitely, a must-have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AER1UUXH9NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ERJZ74#wasThisHelpful","R13AER1UUXH9NF","A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More, like an expanded 2-CD reissue of the (often hard-to-find) Hawkwind's 'Space London 1972' or the 'BBC Radio One Live In Concert' (see my reviews of both) only better. Looks like this must-own 'At The BBC - 1972' 2-CD piece has an entire disc of this essential HW live material that has never been released before. Comes with a 10-page CD booklet - with several vintage concert pics - that I don't remember seeing anywhere else. Highly recommended - especially for the completists and die-hard fans.

"Corpus Christi - garage rock band's only full CD that is most likely their complete repertoire or (at least) a good most of it. Compilation features tracks that are from 1967-69. Tunes that did it for me are the familiar-sounding rocking ""I Can See"", their well-done Yardbirds cover ""The Nazz Are Blue"", the foot-stomping ""Big Boss Man"", the bluesy ass-kicker ""Al's Blues"", ""Look For Tomorrow"", the inspirational title cut ""Reality Is The Only Answer"" and ""Naw, Naw, Naw"". Liberty Bell was notably launched by their record label back then Cee-Bee Records to be that of a Texan styled Yardbirds.

"Initially released in 1980, as this was the band's sole record that was notably put out in a limited quantity of 500 copies. Best described as well-produced well-played instrumental jazz rock - to thoroughly soak in. Couple of tracks worth mentioning are the soothing ""Kernein"", ""Vurz Im Morgangrauen"", ""Paulchen"", ""On My Way To Ubermorgan"" (awesome keyboards), the eight-minute ""Seiben Plus Bossa"". Also dug several of this lp's CD reissue's nine added bonus cuts - like the ""Sir Jerry"", somewhat innovative ""Schmalzer"" and ""Rush Hour In Madrid"". CD duration is clocked in at 80:33. Something I haven't seen too often. Original vinyl album copies of 'Ubermorgan' is said to be in fair demand among connoisseurs and collectors.

Tracks here that most assuredly did it for me were the beautifully arranged opener ""Nottanum Town"", the really nice acoustic piece ""Peggy"", the nine-minute jazzy ""The Hunt"" (good violin solo), ""Time Past, Time Come"" which - respectfully employs stellar flute, bass, violin and acoustic guitar and the eight-minute ""Minas Tirith"".

"Originally released in 1979,  as this was Pancake's third and final lp - see my reviews of their first two records 'Roxy Elephant' ('75) and 'Out Of The Ashes' ('77). Best described as progressive. Liked the first couple of tracks - I especially thought that ""Just Miss Your Smile"" and ""Fire And Rain Song"" were well-played, as I thoroughly enjoyed the nine-minute ""Dream Delta Land"" and the rocking ""I Try"". Plus, the six added bonus cuts (notably unreleased material from 1980 perhaps an unfinished Pancake fourth lp) are definitely a fine addition to this welcomed CD reissue.

Nice to hear this previously unreleased live Out Of Focus CD - especially after taking in the first two German jazz / fusion /psych lp reissues 'Wake Up' ('70) and their self-titled record ('70) - see my reviews of both. Tracks that notably did the most for me were the somewhat innovative opener ""Whispering"", the twelve-minute rocking (so to speak) ""I Want To See Your Face No More"", the twenty-minute epic ""Fly Bird Fly / Television Program"" and the astounding closer - definitely possesses an early '70's feel to it ""I'm Kissing Right"" - as the cut progresses, some unexpected and somewhat annoying (?) vocals take you by surprise - but rest assure 'Palermo 1972' is still a fine pick.

"To avoid any and all confusion, this is the short-lived German band that released two lp's during their brief existence - 'Revelation' (early '71) and 'Thoughts' (late '71) then later - Garden Of Delights put out this CD of their unreleased material. Although they've so often been tagged as krautrock - Virus is actually more in the hard rock psych vein. Didn't realize it at first, but 'Remember' was recorded at a live shindig in Koln on April 28, 1973 for WDR radio show. It looks like all of the nine tracks on this CD are exclusive to this piece. Starts off with ""Everybody Knows That I've Got This Feeling"", the awesome ""There Is No Anarchy"", the title track ""Remember"" and ""In Any Way"" are basically - very high energy - well-played rock 'n roll. Some of the vocals sort of maybe remind me of early Traffic and the guitar brings to mind - perhaps Ten Years After. ""Rock 'N Roll"" is a very good bluesy tune. Also got a lot out of ""King Heroin"" and the ten-minute instrumental ""Woods Fun"". This disc would've made a great soundtrack for the first 'Fritz The Cat' movie. Should draw in fans of Frumpy.

"Another must-have archive live CD release on the Garden Of Delights label. Show was recorded live on November 4, 1972 at the Assembly Hall in Wiesbaden, Germany. According to the liner notes, an appreciative crowd of about 300 shows up. Three lengthy tracks to thoroughly absorb - as with most early live Guru Guru performances. First, there's ""Oxymoron"" (28:32) which is great to experience but after around eight minutes - the trio goes into another song - I cannot say for sure what tune of theirs it is - but it's more in the bluesy progressive vein. Still brilliant, rest assure of that. Next, it's the awesome ""Baby Cake Walk"" (23:50) which is a true -classic- Guru Guru trip out and this disc's final cut is the band's staple ""Ooga Booga"" (22:05). Believe that to this very day, founder Mani Neumeier and crew still plays this krautrock gem - live. Comes with an irreplaceable 30-page CD booklet - written in both English and German.

"As the price of good quality XL training pads continues to climb, I am happy to find a decent brand that doesn't wreck my budget. It is not the best on the market but pretty darn close considering the price of the 4 pack. The Iris pads look and feel a bit thin but don't let that fool you. Whatever they are made of still absorbs urine quickly (little to no pooling depending on the size of the dog) and holds as much as some of the costlier, thicker pads I have tried.

However, it does absorb moisture well and keeps the floor dry. Mine does not wick the moisture away and lock it in. When I press on a damp area, my hand, foot, knee, or whatever body part I'm  using gets wet. I don't like that feeling, and I don't like a wet bum.

"I tried out the Kelty Cosmic 21 Kelty Degree 550 Dridown sleeping bag on an overnight hike. All I can say is wow - how manufacturing has changed for the better since I bought my last mummy bag. There is no comparison to anything I've owned in the past, plus I love all the attention to detail.It had recently rained heavily along our trail so the terrain and weather was cold (around 50*), and damp at night. We travel without a tent on overnight hikes so we were in the elements. The sleeping bag performed as promised. I was warm and dry, very comfortable even in those damp conditions. The claims to dry 33% faster than regular down are pretty close. The very damp exterior dried quickly in the sunlight in time to pack dry for the day's travels. Detail: there are a couple of small and large loops on the outside that can be used to hang the bag to dry.The bag is very lightweight and rolls back down to fit in the nylon cinched pouch provided. It takes patience and pressure but it can be done. Just be sure the bag is completely dry first. Detail: the storage pouch doesn't cinch all the way closed. There is a nylon flap that covers the opening from the inside. That way the bag can breath during storage.The down is very soft although not super thick. It feels luxurious, not lumpy. It does not bunch up into rock hard balls like I'm used to, and there are no sharp quills poking through that would wake me up at night if I wiggled too much.The zipper is nylon but sturdy. It won't rust = I won't get trapped inside. Detail: it is insulated on the inside along the track of the zipper by a thick down-filled panel. It shields out the cold and dampness that can migrate inward along the zipper line. The zipper opens on the right side on both the inside and outside from the top. Detail: there is also an outside pull about mid calf that opens upwards to vent the feet/legs if desired. I really appreciated that option because I'm one of those people that like their feet cooler off and on than the rest of the body, even when damp and chilly outside. It kept me from feeling trapped or overheated.Detail: there is a down-filled collar around the inside front of the neckline that further insulates again cold and dampness when the head cover is cinched down. It can also be folded down inside the bag on temperate nights when you're not fighting the cold or dampness so much.Overall, it's the attention to detail and versatility as a three season bag that impresses me the most. I'm not locked into a pure cold or warm weather bag. I've owned several down-filled sleeping bags in my lifetime, and this one performs the best by far.  Here are some specs from the tags and wrapper:Regular is 78"" x 31"". It's filled with sterilized 81% duck down and 19% polyester fiber. Inner and outer lining is polyester. Made in China.Funny thing, it's cold rated for 21* F for men but only 35*F for women. I never new women and men tolerated cold differently. Disclaimer - temperatures did not reach that cold during our outing. It's almost summer here. We'll see this winter how that claim holds up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NM5GANUAH46V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFAYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NM5GANUAH46V","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally a dipping sauce that has a little heat, a lot of sweet but no garlic. Minor's Sweet Chili sauce is not the gelatinous goop you get at the local Chinese buffet. It is a smooth pourable sauce that's just hot enough without going overboard. I like it with fried foods best, like egg rolls and fried shrimp, but I tried it with the naked wings we had delivered from a pizza place last night, and it was perfect. Tonight I'm making hawaiian chicken with it, sautéing chicken breasts with bell pepper, red onion then adding pineapple, a little broth, and this sauce. I bet it would be good on grilled shrimp too.This is a large bottle that lasts only a week after opening but I'm going to freeze the leftovers in small portions to use later. There's a chart that comes with it for mixing this sauce with everyday condiments and with other sauces from this line. Some look like great ideas, especially with ketchup or BBQ sauce. I'd like to try it with a little vinegar and olive oil to dress a fruit salad or coleslaw. I wonder how this would work with cool whip in ambrosia.

"This product does a good job of absorbing pet urine quickly, especially for the price. All pads will wick moisture up under the plastic if the pet wets too close to the edge. This one does the same.

"I'm pleased with the taste and versatility of Minor's Stir Fry Sauce. Besides using it as the sauce in my chicken/veg stir fry,  I've added it to meatloaf instead of tomato sauce and to meatballs and thinned with broth to make light sauce to go with the noodles. I also used it as a basting sauce for grilled chicken. In stir fry it gives me the taste of restaurant Chinese food that I just couldn't get by mixing ingredients myself. Mixed with hamburger or basted on meat it gives the dish an Asian twist. A little goes along way! Plus watch your salt content. I don't use much salt, and there's enough in this product that I didn't need to add any to my meat or other dishes. I decided against using it as a marinade because the sugar content might cause the meat to burn when grilling.There is a very useful chart for mixing this sauce with everyday condiments and with other sauces in this line. Imagination going wild here ....This is a large bottle, and unless you plan to use it all in a week (manufacturer's safe time limit), you may try to freeze some. I plan on freezing leftovers in ice cube trays and then putting the cubes in a ziplock bag until I need it, just like freezing stock. I don't know how well it will freeze but it's worth trying and better than letting it go to waste.

"I wouldn't say my dog is a picky eater. He'll eat just about anything I put in front of him, but for some reason he turns his nose up at these. He literally turns his head to the side away from me when I offer him one. If I set it on the floor he will eventually lick it and eat it. They are a little crunchy but not hard. He's a big dog, and these are large enough so that it takes him about 30 seconds to eat one. He can't gulp them down which was one concern I had.I had planned on using them as a reward for his letting me groom him each day, but he just looks at me with those big brown eyes like saying, are you kidding me?

"I absolutely love this pet gate. I've been using it for several months and have no problems. Our apartment complex does not allow screen doors, so we needed something to keep our dog in while leaving the door open for air circulation. This was the only brand I found that met all of our needs. It is easy to set up and take down, it does not require any drilling or screws into the woodwork, and it expands completely to fit our front door space. We do not use the small pet door included but I tried it, and its fully functional for small dogs, such as terriers, yorkies, Chihuahuas, etc.I position the gate in the doorway on the threshold itself. The gate expands sideways to fit up against the door jam on both sides. There are 2 soft rubber pads on each side that hold it in place without damaging the door jam. The gate also rests up against the front edge of the door jam, giving it extra security. Please see the photos.The mechanism that holds it in place is a plastic knob that expands as you twist it to lock the gate in place. It takes seconds to set up and take down. This gate does not have a door for people to pass through, but I didn't need that feature. All I wanted was a tall, sturdy gate that would keep my large dog indoors but could take the many ups and downs it would have to over the spring and fall seasons when I'll use it. My dog isn't a climber, and he doesn't try to crash the gate, so I can't speak to that part of it, but it is very windy here, and the locking mechanism has never failed to hold in it place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9FT33XV5MBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089HDZYO#wasThisHelpful","RX9FT33XV5MBA","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the strongest, stickiest tape of any kind that I have used. The adhesive is so strong that it bonds to almost anything. A small piece of plastic broke off my dustpan/broom combo. I fabricated a new piece from the duct tape and then used more tape to attach it. Now it works like a charm. I covered a crack in one of my favorite flower pots, and it holds water without leaking. You can't beat that. I've repaired binders, a hose, and a patio chair leg. I'm on a roll. Nothing can stop me now. The backing is so strong that you need scissors or a knife to cut it. Repeated use does leave a trace of adhesive on the blade. Also, if you have sensative skin, repeated use pulls at the skin on your fingertips.A surprise use is to remove pet hair and dust from fabric. My dog sheds a lot, and I can go through a lot of regular tape to remove it from my clothes and sofa. This removes it all, even the residue left behind by the vacuum. Just remember that it is very strong and may be too harsh for delicate fabrics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3FIJWB23VKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5R21XG#wasThisHelpful","R2B3FIJWB23VKA","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use several Avery products, but this by far is one of the more useful ones. The dividers themselves are made of thick semitransparent plastic and have diagonal storage pouches on each one. You can use the sheet of sticky labels provided to print out tags for each divider at once or you cann simply write the name in the divider tab.The pouches are what make these special. The possibilities are endless. I'm using some to hold info cards, color chips, and bits and pieces that go with projects I'm making, and another for recipe cards for a weeks worth of new menus I want to make. They could hold handouts or business cards, fabric swatches, yarn samples or threads and needles, kid's stickers, a couple of crayons to color pages you've put in a binder to keep kids busy - you get the idea. Anything you need that doesn't actually fit in a binder might just fit these pouches. They don't close so keep the binder upright, and they don't actually hold 70 pages.

"While the two step application by brush is like that done in a salon, I found it too difficult to get the appropriate coverage by myself. It is nearly impossible to see and cover the root areas on the back of the head by oneself. That is best done by a second person who can see the entire head. This is especially important for short hair or those with large areas of gray.I've given this product 2 stars because the medium red does not cover gray well at all but fails to address this with a disclaimer or warning. If you have only scattered strands of gray, you will get light red/pink highlights. If you have sections of gray at the crown, top, sides, etc or any large areas of continuous gray, you will have solid patches of non-red light color, anywhere from strawberry blond to dark pink, that does not match the red cast on your darker hair. This is the problem with most red hair color on gray hair. If you've experienced this before, you know what I'm talking about, and this product is not the answer.If you don't have any gray and can manage the two step application perfectly, you will have very nice results. The red takes beautifully on non- gray hair with a nice sheen. But again, as with all red hair color, it fades quickly after a few shampoos.If you love red, your hair has only a few scattered strands of gray, you have the patience and ability to apply it correctly or have help with the application, and you are willing to reapply frequently, this is a great product for you. If your hair has solid sections of gray, you don't want to reapply frequently, or you'd have difficulty applying this evenly to the roots in sections of your hair all around, this is not the product for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXOVUFH04B9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OE34NP2#wasThisHelpful","R1DXOVUFH04B9J","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Keystone USB fan actually delivers on its promises. If you've tried any number of small, portable fans like I have, you know there are a lot of stinkers out there on the market. Either the fan blade is ridiculously loud, the fan vibrates on the desk, or there is barely any output. Not the Keystone. It's the real deal.The listing says it is a 6"" fan, but the diameter is actually 8"". The height of the fan is 9 1/2"". It is made of lightweight plastic. It comes with a 48"" USB cord and an electric adapter. The fan works equally well with both, which I found surprising. I also decided to hook the USB cord to a female USB extension cord that I use with my iPhone. Works great, and it added an extra 3 feet to the cord. The power button turns to adjust the fan speed along a continuum instead of one or two ""high"" or ""low"" settings. There is a difference in speed but not a huge amount of range. The fan blade tilt range is very small. The description says 15* but I wonder if it is even that. The blade guard comes off to clean by using a Phillips head screwdriver in the bottom front. There is very little clearance there. You will need a long, narrow screwdriver shaft.The output on the highest setting is a little weaker than the 9"" Lasko I purchased from Amazon a few years back. I'll be using it at night while I sleep so that won't be a problem. I'm sitting 27"" from the fan, and I can feel I nice, light breeze on my face. Perfect. But the main thing that blows me away is how quiet it is. There is NO sound. None that I detect. This is the first fan I have ever owned that is virtually silent.

I actually need the extra large size but this brand was out of that size too. So I made a patchwork layout of 4 of them. These appear thin and they feel very soft compared to the other brand, but somehow they absorb all the liquid.

"The Artaste 46861 Juicer, Slicer, and Corer is a pretty handy 3-in-1 kitchen gadget. It is a large device that's for certain, but since it does the job of 3 appliances, I can forgive that. Each function has its overall pros and cons which I've listed below. I suggest you at least read the cons before making a decision about purchasing this gadget. I can live with them all, and for me the pros outweigh the cons, but one or more may be a deal breaker for you. Please look at the pics that illustrate some of its functions for additional reference.I'll start with the size and description since that is pretty important. The base is 9"" deep and 7 1/2"" wide. The height with the handle closed is 19"" and the depth increases to 17 1/2"" due to the handle length. The height increases to 31"" with the handle raised. It's heavy at about 15 lbs +/-. The base has a rubber mat that can be removed for cleaning.The interchangeable blades are easy to install. However, the plastic ""pusher disc"" could be trouble for those who have difficulty manipulating small objects. It is attached by perfectly aligning and then inserting two small black oval discs up from the underside into the metal plate at the same time and then twisting. It was very stiff at first but became easier with time. Also, the outside rings of the blade plates are rough and even a little sharp on some edges. One is not completely round as if a small chunk was cut from it. All metal plates are lightly scratched. It's easy to see that quality control is not job #1. But they work.Juicer -Pro: the juicer diameter is about 5"" which means I can actually juice medium sized grapefruit and large oranges. I own a pricey Hamilton Beach Professional manual juicer that is amazing, but I can't fit even a small grapefruit in that all the way. Both extract about the same amount of juice, but the handle on the Hamilton requires almost no force while this brand does.Cons: it lets a little pulp through. If you absolutely cannot stand pulp (me), then think twice about this unit. HINT: The larger diameter is more important to me so I simply strain my grapefruit juice before drinking. Also, the distance between the spout in the bottom pad is about 7"" so using a small glass has the potential to cause splashing. You need to hold it closer.Slicer -Pros: the french fry grid makes fries a little wider than 1/2"". Yea! I'm so tired of other slicers maxing out at 1/4"" or 3/8"" slices. The slicing is fairly easy, not too much force needed, but leaving the potato skin on makes it harder. HINT: the slicer may work for other firm vegetables with tough skin like cucumbers or zucchini. I haven't tried it. It does just squash tomatoes.Cons: you have to buy or cut potatoes to about 3 1/4"" to fit. Short fries are ok for me, but if you want them long, forget it.Corer -Pros: it does an amazing job of coring and slicing apple wedges. Whack! HINT: I've also used it to wedge potatoes for making thick steak fries, home fries (I chopped them in half again by hand), roasted potato wedges, and for boiling for potato salad or mashed potatoes. I've also chopped a couple of hard boiled eggs at a time with it. Pretty useful gadget. Don't try tomatoes. Squish!Con: the apple wedges are too thick to use for making pies, which was the main reason I wanted this appliance. You can still bake them or eat them raw.So there you have it. I'm really pleased with this device. I continue to find non-traditional uses for the blades which makes cooking fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL6YE0KSWMFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ47FFS#wasThisHelpful","R1HL6YE0KSWMFD","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My dry skin is left absolutely soft and moisturized from the first few uses. The coconut scent is initially strong but not offensive, and it fades rapidly.

"Although I was skeptical of the value of this book when I ordered it, ""Getting a Big Data Job for Dummies"" turned out to be a great resource for those that understand this field, those that are clueless, and those who are not quite sure whether or not it is right for them. The book follows in the tradition of the other ""for dummies"" books and is an easy read. It assumes the reader knows little or nothing about this field. By the time you are finished reading it, you will know whether or not this is the field for you.""Big Data"" contains simple, concise descriptions of work in this field, a breakdown by industries, suggested educational paths, and job seeking tips to help reach one's goal of employment. This is no easy task as the field of big data is vast and extremely varied. The book examines work in the public and private sectors as well as great information about tackling one's own startup.""Bid Data"" peeks into careers in pure science as well as opportunities in retail, consulting, government, industrial, medical, theoretical and applied fields, and much more, all with the focus on if this is the right career for the reader. There is a section that helps breakdown job listings to get a clear idea of what the companies are looking for. There is also a section that examines analytical tools and software one should be familiar with and lists a few free versions to try.Once the reader has decided that big data is the career to pursue, there is advice regarding various educational pathways. There are also tips on writing the perfect resume, nailing interviews, and using social media to your advantage that would be helpful to job seekers in any field. These sections are tremendously helpful.I particularly liked the social media section as I had not considered this easily searched information as content that could affect an applicant's success. It brings into focus our public persona, our own personal ""brand,"" that is out there for all to see whether we realize it or not. ""Big Data"" provides tips for scrutinizing ones public face, cleaning up that which might not advantageous, and establishing a positive profile on professional networking sites as well as general social media. This chapter was eye opening to say the least.There is also a comprehensive glossary, which is my favorite part of the book. In this field, understanding the basic terminology as well as the latest catch phrases is key to success and is absolutely expected. The glossary does a great job of familiarizing the job hunter with the secret language of data speak. I have a background in medical informatics and data analysis, and even I learned some new terms. I'll be keeping this book handy, but out of sight, for future reference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MONHKVRPLEIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118903404#wasThisHelpful","R2MONHKVRPLEIZ","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everyone's body chemistry is different, so this EDT will have a different scent for each one wearing it. I'm happy to read many reviewers like this scent. For me, it simply does not work.For those familiar with the fragrance Ambush by Dana that was so popular years ago, on me ROMA initially follows that same scent line. My immediate first impression was, Wow! This is Ambush all over again."" It has that bright, sweet, floral-ish vanilla overtone at first, but unlike Ambush, a lemony fragrance studded with faint licorice soon begins to emerge. The sweet vanilla top note fades quickly as does the citrus, replaced by a strong alcohol/soap scent. Once that is gone, the bottom note is woody - not spicy or musky wood - just plain 2x4 wood beam. Although the scent is quite strong and aggressive when first applied, it fades to almost nothing within two hours. It is an EDT after all. They just don't last like cologne or perfume.I do like the cute, chunky bottle. It is easy to grasp and spray as well. However, I will not be wearing this fragrance. Unfortunately, it does not mix well with my body chemistry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH94D9196F28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RO2ZOI#wasThisHelpful","RSH94D9196F28","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not an expensive, professional chef model, but I am a home cook that doesn't need the latest and greatest version of every kitchen gadge. I just need dependable products that do what they are supposed to, that last, and that make cooking easier and fun. That is exactly what I get with the Swissmar Borner V slicer.I am very pleased with the quality of this mandolin. The blades are very sharp as advertised. I've had no problem slicing anything from potatoes to celery, eggplant to hard boiled eggs. The thickness is adjustable from thick down to nearly paper thin by simply sliding the knob on the outer edge of the mandolin and adjusting the blade plate to the proper position. Very easy to do. Like all mandolins, you have to use some elbow grease to slice the food, but this brand is so sharp that it is much easier and smoother to use. I appreciate the safety guard for the blade slicer when not in use and the hard plastic container for the menacing-looking julienne blades. Being able to store them straight into that container when still wet to let them drip dry while still being protected is awesome.The handle is thick and has ridges which makes it easy to grip. The bottom grips the counter and cutting board much better than other brands I've tried. The safety food holder is better than most. The prongs that grasp the food are long and the recessed cap area deep so you really get a good grip on the food you are slicing. But it is small by necessity to fit the width of the mandolin, so some items just don't fit. Use safety gloves always!I'm able to make a great chop or mince of my vegetables once I got the hang of the technique using the julienne blades. It is so much faster and easier than using a knife, and my eyes are thankful for less time exposed to onion fumes!My only complaint is with the width of the julienne blades. The are great for shreds and thin sticks, but the widest width slices potatoes the size of shoe string fries. I had hoped to use this to cut at least medium french fries, but there's no way. If they had included a wider-spaced blade, even for a few dollars more, I would have given it 5 stars.I always wear a safety glove when using  a mandolin. This is my current pair that I bought on Amazon. These saved my finger once already.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007TSJHGO/ref=pdp_new_dp_review","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SXEOZP46Q5O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DZ0BRG#wasThisHelpful","R2SXEOZP46Q5O4","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fellowes 5 mm laminating sheets do an excellent job of protecting documents, photos and other important papers. Since they are open on three sides it makes it very easy to place multiple pictures, cards or whatever you choose to laminate into the correct positions. It is so much easier than using a pouch closed on three sides like the ones we use at work. With Fellowes, I can place everything exactly where I want it.So far, I've laminated photos into a few collages that I can frame, some important documents, and crochet patterns that I know I'll be using repeatedly. The laminate surfaces become clear and glossy once heated, and all sides close completely. I'm able to make notes on the crochet patterns with dry eraser makers, such as row count, then wipe them off once done. My Fellowes laminating machine has had no problems handling the 5 mm thickness.I highly recommend this product.

"These decorating tips are very easy to use, but the containers are so small. This is my only complaint. Otherwise I really, really like this 8 piece set. Two containers are ok if you only have a few dozen cookies or cupcakes to decorate, like one batch, or if you aren't going to need much frosting to detail a cake. But if you have a lot to decorate, say for a big party or bake sale, you will be refilling them all day. The steel tips can always be placed inside a pastic bag and used that way for large batches, but that kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing this set.I really like how easy it is to fill these with the wide-mouth openings and how easy they are to clean. The tips are a good quality steel but not quite as thick as professional tips. The silicone is so soft and easy to depress. It's almost like second nature, and you only need one hand to decorate. That leaves the other hand free to manipulate the item being decorated if need be. It is so easy to control the frosting output by depressing with only your thumb and moving the tip that rests between your first and second finger By flexing and rotating your wrist. It is so much easier than twisting and moving a bag with two hands, at least for me it is. It's so similar to writing but on a larger scale that even an amateur like myself picked up on the technique pretty fast. Having the two containers lets me change between flavors easily if that's the way I'm going.I've had no problem opening or closing the lids when my hands are dry and I get a good grip. I can see how somemay have difficulty since the lip you must grip is small.It would be great if you could buy just the containers themselves to load up with extra frosting ahead of time.

"I began reading ""The Evil Hours"" by David H. Morris not knowing what to expect. I live with PTSD and have been searching for insight beyond what my past counseling had provided. I was initially pessimistic, believing this book would be either a sappy, whiny, poor-me bio or just another cold, clinical regurgitation of knowledge I already have. It was neither. ""The Evil Hours"" is a look into the author's personal journey to understand the PTSD he now lives with. Being a journalist, he was able to pull himself out of the picture and focus his investigative and analytical skills in a third party manner. I appreciate the research that I would never have tackled.Morris' research is impressive yet not intimidating. The result is an impassioned yet logical approach to understanding PTSD today. His journey uncovers both the history of the disorder as well as the current  inconsistencies in understanding, classification and treatment; however, his story does not stop there. While coming to grips with the enormity of this condition in modern society, the author turns conventional understanding and coping mechanisms on their ears. From the basic assumption that PTSD  causes a break in time for those that live with it to the unconventional belief that one can actually grow emotionally and cope successfully precisely because one endured severe trauma and yet lived, the author challenges the reader to examine the research, apply it to one's situation, and to draw one's own conclusion.Reading ""The Evil Hours"" has been cathartic for me. I was challenged to step out of my fear and into a new understanding of what happened to me, how time is now broken, and the opportunities I now have to move on. I also realize that I am not alone in this, I am not crazy, and I no longer need to be ashamed. Don't misunderstand what I am saying: this is not a therapeutic manual nor does Morris claim to have discovered a miracle cure. What I am saying is that this book challenged me to take a look at PTSD from a new perspective - a different angle - and then act on that perspective. Knowledge is power, and that is what I personally have gained from reading this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTJR478O7B1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544086619#wasThisHelpful","R1VTJR478O7B1N","A35JP8KSV9281K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JP8KSV9281K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been shaving my head for the last 5-6 years and have been using a single bladed razor and a highly concentrated shave cream (Cremo Cream) with amazing results. But I being one who is quite satisfied, I enjoy trying out new things.This AHAVA Foam-Free Shaving Cream looked like it was going to be a good match for me as it is similar to my Cremo Cream that I have been using.Initially the smell was a bit off putting for me. Too strong and it seemed to linger a bit. Since the ingredients aren't listed, I was quite disappointed as I like to know exactly what I'm applying to my face and head.Lathering up went well and the initial few strokes with a brand new blade was awesome. Nice and close, smooth, felt great. HOWEVER as time went on (about two minutes into shaving), the blade started to get really clogged up with the shave cream. The cream was no longer a cream and was acting like a soft layer of wax all over my face and head. In addition, it took forever to wash the residue off. Not the best shaving experience I've had in years.So thinking that it was how I used it (for my head), I tried it on a smaller area, just my face. The results were better. Just a little bit of razor clogging and it didn't turn into the waxy state that I had experienced before.So I learned one thing about this product, it's definitely not for shaving your head with! Stick with smaller areas and you will not experience the horrible waxy situation like I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQKH8NPP130O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KE40EQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IQKH8NPP130O","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dragonfly design is by far my favorite Iron Stop spinner!Right from the get go, this one was the only spinner that wanted to spin and with the least amount of wind, let alone it was also the easiest to bend and get the required angle on the lily-pads.I also prefer the design of this spinner over most due to it's shape and while it's in motion it's much more cleaner/smoother in motion because of it's more spherical shape.As with many spinners, I highly suggest that you snug up the acorn nuts that hold the spinners together as they tend to be loose right out of the box (don't over tighten them either!).Installed near out bird bath and with the sun hitting it just right, it's a beautiful sight on a summer evening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZNCSLF9A5MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOKJC#wasThisHelpful","R15ZNCSLF9A5MA","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just like the other Iron Stop Kinetic Wind Spinner (the Hummingbird version), location, location, location. Minimal amount of wind is needed for it to spin, but sustained wind is when this baby just takes off. It's almost kind of scary to watch this thing spin when the wind picks up, almost saw blade like.With this design of spinner, I found that extra care was needed while bending the butterflies to the necessary 30 angle due to the thin leaf like formations that hold/are attached to the butterflies. If you don't pay attention, you can easily bend them out of shape.The quality of the piece is great. When it catches the light it looks amazing and once it starts spinning it's just gorgeous!

"I had this Iron Stop Hummingbird spinner out for a few weeks with little to no effect. Didn't spin worth a darn.Finally on a nice and windy day I decided to pick it up and move it around, sure enough the location I had chose was a dead zone for wind. Sure it LOOKED as though wind was coming through the area, but it was dead.So after weeks of disappointment from this spinner, a new location and it came to life! So don't be a complete idiot like I was, try out a few locations to find the best spot.Putting it together was easy. Just bend the hummingbirds a little bit and you're good to go. The acorn nuts on my spinner was a bit loose right out of the box so a small amount (1/2 a turn) was needed to insure the spinner wouldn't come off.My only complaint is the paper cutout gauge they provide to insure you get the correct angle on the spinner. A cardboard gauge would be a lot better and easier to use.As this thing spins and catches the light, it looks beautiful.

"We recently had our garage door replaced and installed with a new garage door opener (a Raynor model). However it seems to be a bit on the loud side at 70db during operation. With a bedroom wall right up against the garage, opening it early in the morning is simply a wakeup call for the person in the bedroom.Installation for this Chamberlain 1 1/4HP door opener went smoothly and was straight forward. If you are a DIYer, plan on taking the entire afternoon with you and a buddy (or two) to get it done. Alone and it will take almost all weekend.Adjustment for the door travel allowed for a perfectly tight seal along the bottom of the door with zero gap.What we really liked the most was the wireless outdoor control panel. This was something that our old garage door opener lacked and is a huge plus.Battery backup works like a charm (Chamberlain recommends testing it several times a year) and the lighted wall panel with clock with temp is a nice touch.As for the quietness of the opener, it is quieter... WAY quieter. No more rude awakenings for anyone in the house!Overall, I am sold on the quality and performance of the garage door opener.

"I have used and still own many sanders. Two Black & Decker, two Hitachis, a Porter Cable, a Mikita, as well as a a rather old Delta. Of all of them the B&Ds have never performed well nor held up over time. However this one seems to crack that mold.First off is the build quality. This is right on par with the higher end sanders like the Porter Cable and Mikita. Well weighted, good materials used for the construction of the sander, very pleased to see this! The on off switch is sealed so dust doesn't get inside and start causing issues.The hook and loop pad again follows this trend of quality. All of the different brands of sandpaper stuck like glue to the pad, even the sandpaper that has a tendency to want to come off by itself stayed stuck. Over the next few weeks I'll find out how durable the pad really is and whether it will still be holding up.The actual action of sanding went smoothly and produced a great finished product. With some of the lower quality sanders, I've noticed that they can develop or rotate in a manner that is predictable which leaves an unwanted design of swirl marks, not with this B&D.What stops this from being a 5 star sander are only two slight issues.First is the noise level, it's a bit loud and fairly high pitched. This is an obvious statement with most sanders, but there are some that are just quieter.The second is the dust collection. Not a fan of their canister system. With only a few hours under it's belt, the canister has already become loose despite having a sealing O-ring. In addition it has a small dust port which without a lot of fiddling with does NOT accept a vacuum hose (my preferred method of dust collecting when sanding!!).I am glad to see B&D stepping up their game with this sander. It's been years since a I've used a B&D tool without setting it back down in anger or disgust!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEAIHLO2MACB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLSS1SW#wasThisHelpful","R2MEAIHLO2MACB","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Ammex gloves are great!The medium size fits much better than another brand we typically use which allows for better dexterity when handling objects.The fingertips are textured and provide adequate tactile feel and grip.However the most important thing for us is how long they last before they tear and these lasted quite a long time. They are only 4mils thick (not the thickest), but with normal usage they seem to last long enough.Reason for docking them a star is due to the fact they (the manufacturer) does not list the thickness and I had to go track it down.

"I've been using another brand of nitrile gloves for several years (ShieldGloves if anyone was wondering) and I thought I'd give these a try.First impressions were underwhelming. Immediately upon slipping them on my hands, I could tell they are too small (I wear an XL, these fit closer to just a large). Although they say they are 4mil and 5mil in the fingertips, they seem thinner. This may be due to the fact that they fit tight on my hands thus they are stretched out a bit thinner.During my testing period I was working on my cars and ended up using four gloves due to tearing. With my normal gloves I NEVER have this issue.And price wise, once again they fell short for me. Purchase price for the gloves I use is only ¢6 a glove, whereas with these they are ¢15, two and a half times the price!I'm willing to pay more for a better, stronger glove that will protect my hands, but when they tear easier and I use twice as many of them for the same task, there is no way I can justify making the switch to Ammex gloves.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3MU0QDVPS6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E21HDK#wasThisHelpful","R3J3MU0QDVPS6W","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, the ring pictured here on Amazon doesn't look as good as the actual ring.The Claddagh ring looks amazingly beautiful.

"Well it seems odd reviewing toilet paper, but to be honest it's probably one of the items that we use daily (if not multiple times a day) without any consideration or really any thought.Charmin's Ultra Mega roll lives up to the hype. Not only does the roll last a long time (due to it's thicker construction which leads to you needing less) it is much softer than most. And by lasting longer I'm talking at least twice as long as our normal bathroom tissue (AngelSoft Jumbo roll). We usually use a roll per week and we're only down about half way through a roll and and we're almost pushing two weeks.So the combination of more sheets and stronger/thicker tissue is working out nicely. :)I thought what we had been using was just fine, but it's nice to know there is something just a little bit nicer out there.

"Zero complaints!The Vornado personal space heater is wonderful. The amount of space it takes up on the desk or floor is very minimal.A single on/off switch with a second high, low, and fan only switch makes using the heater intuitive and easy without any fiddly dials to play with.On the low setting, its great for taking the chill off or keeping you nice and comfortable. On the high setting, it will warm you and your personal space quickly.The heater is nearly silent at 3-4 feet away. And with it's ability for throwing heat about 10-12 feet with ease, you can set it far enough away so that it IS silent.Combined with it's stay cool grille (no matter how long you run it, it only gets warm to the touch!), tip-over auto shut off, blocked air flow shut off (inlet or outlet air gets block, it will shut off), and it's tight grille fins (to prevent tiny wondering fingers from getting into things), this is one safe little heater!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D01Q7FZHSRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXEJ6PC#wasThisHelpful","R10D01Q7FZHSRM","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been eating another brand (Nutiva) for a while now and this is a good alternative.Nutritionally compared to Nutiva, it's about the same, a good combination of fat, protein and fiber.Taste wise, very nutty and enjoyable. I love making waffles with it. For lunch I like to mix about a 1/4 cup with some water, rice and/or beans with spices (cumin preferably). Cook that up for a few minutes, makes great vegan taco filling!The only reason I removed a star is it's texture.

That and they offer good protecting from handling hot objects. Same with the pot holders (which are my favorite of this set).The only reason I gave them four stars is that the towels aren't hemmed all that well.

"Right from the get go I knew this tumbler was going to be an issue.First off was the double walled portion, it was only half sealed and loose. So the inner portion of the tumbler wiggles around.The tumbler is listed as BPA free, great! However it has ZERO markings as to what it is made of OR if it is made with BPS or BPF (both of which aren't really any better than BPA). Being made in China without any symbol as to the composition of the plastic (PET? HDPE? LDPE?) is quite worrisome.The only positive thing about the tumbler is the straw and the tight sealing lid. The lid seals very tightly, enough so that it can be used as a shaker bottle.So with the double wall portion of the tumbler only half sealed (thus water gets in between the two walls) and not knowing what material this is made from, this tumbler can only receive a marginal 2 stars.

"Hands down Lenox makes the best hole saw kits out there.I had previously purchased their smaller 7 piece construction kit (1815140) for general purpose hole making as you never know when you need to put in a new junction box, ceiling fan, etc.. With the addition of this plumber's kit, I am good to go for many years.One of the best selling points is that this set comes with two of Lenox's amazingly fast quick change arbors (3/8"" and 1/2"" shank). This allows for tool free 5 second blade changes. Just pull down on the mandrel, screw the hole saw on, and pull up on the mandrel to lock the saw in place. On top of that, they include three pilot drill bitsThe kit comes with a dozen hole saws including 3/4"", 7/8"", 1-1/8"", 1-1/2"", 1-3/4"", 2-1/4"", 2-9/16"", 3"", 3-1/2"", 4"", 4-1/4"", and 4-1/2"".In terms of performance, I have not once been let down by these hole saws. Their thin kerf design allows for faster, smoother, cuts in everything. Whether you are cutting drywall, douglas fir, plywood, MDF, you name it, it just cuts like butter. Even on laminate surfaces it leaves a fairly clean hole (though I did have to clean it up a bit with a trim router afterwards).And if you have ever used a hole saw of years past, you know removing the plug from the hole saw is a pain. But with Lenox's Speed Slot, you just jam a screwdriver in the slot and pop the plug out with ease.If you plan on doing some heavy remodeling or construction, I would not hesitate one second in getting this kit, it will pay for itself in minutes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJC3GV8P0D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00065UAUE#wasThisHelpful","RYJC3GV8P0D4","A30IP3E4MDQ36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP3E4MDQ36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The canvas and leather combo is stylish and is wearing awesomely which gives these boots some awesome character.They aren't all that warm to be honest. Thick or heavy socks are recommended.The most impressive thing about these boots are their flexibility and traction. The soles contour nicely to most surfaces providing you with confident foot feel.

"Not sure who enjoys this puzzle map more, the adults or the kids?The quality of this T.S. Shure Wooden Map is superb. Quality plywood, laminate, and magnets are used to insure many hours of use. Only on the larger states (California and Texas being the most obvious) is there some bowing/warpage that prevents them from sitting completely flat against the board or magnetic surface (fridge).The smaller states on the east coast are grouped together due to their size, which is fine. And I like the fact that the great lakes were also included as pieces. One important note that I think is important is that Alaska is NOT to scale which is disappointing.There really isn't anything I would change other than possibly making the pieces out of slightly thicker plywood to prevent the warpage that some of the states are experiencing.

"My expectations for this game were fairly high due to it's subject matter (I love Americana!!) and the overall look and feel of the game. However it was kind of a letdown...Timeline Americana (as well as the other Timeline cards/games) is quite a simple and straight forward game.Game play doesn't take too long which is nice as you can cram a quick game in before dinner or durning a lunch break. So for me the gameplay is about a four. After a few rounds some of the dates are easily remembered, we noticed this after playing it the third or fourth time.I guess the biggest letdown for me, is as many other reviewers have pointed out, the size of the cards... they are TINY. Coming from a company that prides itself in having industry leading talent and artists, I find it odd that they showcase them by producing cards the size of postage stamps.

"Before I got this newest Panasonic razor,  I've been using three other razors for a while now.  So the past two days, I've been determining which gives the best shave. The one on the left in the photo is the razor I'm reviewing, the Panasonic ES-RT97-S model.  The next one is a comparably priced Philips Norelco Model 7300 Shaver. The next one is a Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver I purchased in late 2013. And finally there's a 5 blade King of Shaves conventional razor.I shaved each side of my face with different razors two days in a row and asked my wife to tell me which felt like the closest shave feeling my face with her hands. She was in the kitchen when I was shaving, so she had no idea what I did. I went through a complex sequence of comparisons that is best not to bore you with details.  Basically, I shaved and re-shaved both sides of my face with different razors and created a process of elimination. I’m a career engineer as you might already have guessed.  On the second day, I went through a different sequence – each time asking my wife to independently judge which side of my face had the closest shave by feeling my face.So here is the unbiased results in order of best shave over my two day test.Panasonic ES-RT97-S model (Winner)King of Shaves 5 Blade Shaver (Very Near Tie to Winner)Philips Norelco Model 7300 Shaver (Very Good)Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver (Quite Good)I admit the blade razor was very nearly the same as the Panasonic ES-RT97-S model, but my wife still insisted the side of my face with the Panasonic ES-RT97-S model got the closest shave.  She did not know what razor I used or at what stage of my experiments, so this was absolutely an unbiased test.  The Panasonic ES8103S is nearly two years old and may not be as sharp as it was on day one, but it still gives a good shave.The edger on the Panasonic ES-RT97-S model works much better than my older Panasonic razor. The main reason is you can more easily see what you are doing.Even though this Panasonic ES-RT97-S model is substantially more expensive than the original Panasonic I purchased, I think I would pay the higher price now that I know for sure it can shave virtually the same as a blade razor. I have a fast growing tough beard and it is easy to do a quick touch-up in the afternoon with an electric shaver if need to do it.  If I used a blade razor twice in a day on a regular basis, my skin would break out with pimples or rash indefinitely.The Philips Norelco was a very close second, but it was not difficult to determine it was not as close a shave as this Panasonic ES-RT97-S model.  The footprint of the Norelco’s cleaner and charging station is a little larger footprint.  I’m not such a fan of these charger and cleaner stations for either one because of the space they require.  And I don’t much see much value in them either.  That’s just my personal opinion. You can charge the razor directly if you prefer in both the Norelco and the Panasonic models. You don’t need to use the charger/cleaner bases – purely optional. One thing I miss on my older Panasonic razor is the numerical display that showed the charging level in 10% increments.  I knew at a glance how much charge I had remaining.  Now there are just three orange dots instead of a numerical display on the new Panasonic razor.  I wish they had not abandoned the numerical display, especially considering the new one costs a lot more.The final consideration is the style of the shaver heads. The Norelco uses its traditional triangle of three circular cutting heads instead of a traditional rectangular cutting head.  I have a mustache and goatee beard and the rectangular configuration of the Panasonic razor makes it a lot easier to shave closer to the edge of my beard.  Also, the Norelco razor doesn’t have a built-in edger.  You have to pop off the triangular head and attach a special edger head.  It’s not well suited for trimming and edging breads and mustaches. For shaving wide open spaces, the Norelco works fine.So in conclusion, I believe this Panasonic ES-RT97-S model is an excellent razor.  I’d find it difficult to justify spending any more money than this for a razor. There are lots of less expensive razors to consider, but I have doubts you’ll find one as good as this one for a close shave. So I give my endorsement on this model as a good investment.  If you want to spend less, then get a different model Panasonic razor. The less expensive one is still quite good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W40RJTIGPXLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R3W40RJTIGPXLT","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great companion to my wife’s Tumi Backpack.  This luggage is surprisingly lightweight, yet it’s exceedingly sturdy and so cleverly designed.  In the past, I’ve briefly owned luggage that opened down the middle and it’s not in the least bit fun when it’s opened and half the contents spill out onto the floor.  But Tumi largely solved that problem with a full zippered partition on one side.  Just remember which side.  There are numerous handy pockets and compartments all through this luggage. It has the distinctive bright large gold Tumi zippers to help you identify it on the carousel.  At this price, it’s not so likely it will look like all the other luggage, although I will have to be more observant for the same reason.It’s close to the legal size limit of carry-on luggage, which is actually just what I prefer.  It has a zipper expansion capability if you need to push the limits further or even use it as your checked in luggage in full expansion mode.  I especially like the trolley strap to make it quick and easy to pull an additional bag behind it in tandem.  On my first around the world trip twenty years ago, I had three identical pieces of luggage that I pulled in tandem.  It was amazingly convenient, except on stairs, and this is the first piece of luggage I’ve owned since that time that has a snap-in trolley strap.  Now I want to get another one for my next overseas trip.  Of course, you can use it domestically just as well – no rule about that.I really like the dual rod pullout handle where I can strap the Tumi Backpack on top.  Or alternatively, I can strap my laptop computer case onto it as well.  Now that I’m retired, my wife and I can travel together and she can help with the backpack.  The corners are heavily protected and the wheel wells allow the wheels to freely rotate.  The wheels are large enough diameter not to sink into every small crack in the sidewalk or parking lot. I prefer even larger diameter wheels for that reason. It rolls easily and quietly. The sides appear very stiff and shouldn’t be crushed with a big pile of luggage on top.Admittedly this is quite expensive luggage.  However, if you do a lot of traveling, especially overseas, you will benefit in the long term to own sturdy well built luggage.  I’ve purchased several pieces of luggage in Shanghai that only lasted a one-way trip to San Francisco. Eventually I learned to invest in well built luggage.  I owned one piece of luggage that was a bit costly that just would not catastrophically fail .  It looked beat up after 23 round trips to China, but it still held up far longer than any other luggage I purchased. In the long run, you can spend more on cheaper luggage than one very good piece of luggage that lasts and lasts.  Appearance may not always hold up as long unfortunately.If your budget is in alignment with luggage in this price range, then I believe you will be more than satisfied with Tumi’s luggage product line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHT37T9357PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXNG0ZW#wasThisHelpful","RNHT37T9357PA","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This superb Breakfast Burrito Makers also makes a great tasting pizza from scratch in only 6 or 7 minutes cooking time depending upon how much cheese and other ingredients you use in your recipe. There's a couple of minutes of preheat time. It's like a thin crust pizza when finished and you can mix the ingredients to your personal taste. I didn't show the onions in the photo, but we chopped some up and added that to the mix as well. The next time we cook pizza, we will fold it over or roll it halfway through cooking and finish cooking it Burrito style. It will be less messy to eat that way. There are six recipes in the booklet to get you started.  We were in the mood for pizza when we unboxed it, so that's what prompted us to start that way. This is a good snack cooker and just the right size for the two of us. Of course, if you are cooking for a half dozen people, it will take a while longer to feed everyone.  They can take turns preparing it to their own personal taste.Both the top and lower halves have heating elements, similar to standard hamburger cookers. There's a platter in the center that swings out. The height is just under six inches and the diameter is just over six inches, so it's fairly compact. All the pieces that touch the food are non-stick surfaces. I used a paper towel that I cut into four pieces to wipe it down. The first paper towel piece got most of the cheese off and successive pieces wiped it cleaner and cleaner. It looks clean when finished wiping the surfaces. It says the removable pieces are dishwasher safe, but that doesn't constitute the main pieces. I would assume bacteria will get killed during the preheat and cooking stage. So cleanup is fairly quick, about the same as cooking time.We plan to use it often, especially for a  quick snack.  I’m very pleased with this Burrito Maker and I think you will be pleased, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJ6ASA2DKTQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XQWOFK#wasThisHelpful","RVJ6ASA2DKTQB","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that captivates your attention are the two bold gold colored zippers on the Tumi backpack. They are equally attractive and functional with their smooth action. The size fits my petite 5’ 2” wife’s back perfectly.  Of course, the straps are adjustable for different sized people.  Normally, I would have considered this a unisex backpack, but the gold zippers and petite  size are more becoming on a woman.  I got a laugh from my wife as I tried it on my back.  She said it looked much too small on me.  So much for the unisex backpack category.You shouldn’t have much difficulty finding overhead bin space on an airplane if you use it as your carry-on luggage, even if it is stuffed full. But it’s still a useful size.  You can probably get a 14 inch laptop computer inside, but a 15.6 inch is probably not going to make it.  I tried my 17 inch that has a secondary numeric keyboard for fun.  I was surprised that it fit inside widthwise, but stuck out the top by about five inches.There’s considerable space inside.  The bottom measures about 11 X 6 inches and the height is about 14½ inches, but the sides taper inward as it approaches the top. There is a zippered compartment on one side. In addition there are two pockets below the zipper, one of which is wider than the other plus there is a small width for one or two pens in the middle.  On the opposing side, there is an open pouch going across the full width and is about 11 inches in depth.  You can see it better with the photos I attached.There is some padding on the shoulder straps, but not a lot. And there is a wide band to slip over your carry-on luggage handle extensions. The shiny black nylon material contrasts quite well with the wide gold zippers. It has a look of elegance, which at this price, you’d expect it.  Tumi makes a very wide assortment of luggage, a style for everyone’s unique desire.  It appears to be very well constructed and I expect it to last a very long time. If your budget permits, I believe you’ll find this a very worthwhile investment for your future travel needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P3Q0KYSMQCON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8O6J2G#wasThisHelpful","R1P3Q0KYSMQCON","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this strictly for lower fan noise.  While it is still not as quiet as I want it to be, it is much less noisy than the one I replaced. I think my current issue is because the CPU fan controller is running it at maximum speed. The heat sink feels like it is room temperature.  I've gone into the BIOS settings and I can't see any reason for it to be running at this high RPM.  I know it would be a lot quieter if the fan controller was working properly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RROTG08QMLXF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN62JAY#wasThisHelpful","RROTG08QMLXF5","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now this is something I didn't even know existed and I have needed it so many times. It is exceptionally well built and rugged in appearance. It is made of high quality food grade brushed 18/8 stainless steel - 18% chromium and 8% nickel. That is an expensive metal alloy, so no corners cut there. The snap on clamps grip the lid and seals it air tight.  Unless it is purposely abused, I think this will never fail even with daily use.I took the lid off and put both the container and the lid into the refrigerator overnight to prep it for a day trip. The next morning, I put some cold sandwiches inside along with some other snacks.  I even packed a few Techni Ice HDR 4 Ply Reusable Ice & Heat Packs 3 Sheet Special inside for extra measure.  These are amazing and if you don't already have some, I strongly recommending buying them. I have a Stanley Classic Vacuum Bottle 1.1QT Hammertone Green already, so this Vacuum Crock food container is a perfect companion item - both liquid and solid food storage together from a great company.It is almost like having a portable refrigerator with this combination. Everything inside stays nice and cold (or hot) for the better part of a day.  I forgot to take beginning and ending temperatures versus time.  I'm going to do that and put that in this review when I finish. Nothing like real data to prove the point. I receive a lot of Vine products and this ranks among the most practical I've ever received. I know I will get a lot of use out of this Vacuum Food Crock. I expect to use it primarily for cold storage, but it can be used for hot foods equally as well. I'm very pleased with this to say the least.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1INFWCC0YWH3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISUJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1INFWCC0YWH3P","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a professional home or business security system just like you would see in the movies.  There are many more configurations than this 10 camera system from which to choose. In fact, this security system and video recorder has 16 camera inputs, so you can add another six cameras if you choose.  Quickly to the highlights, you can record  16 simultaneous channels at once and play back all 16 video recordings at once as well.  It says it is high definition, but it is not 1080 lines of resolution – it’s 720 lines.  It’s still technically high definition.  They do make a full 1080 version for a higher price.  Unlike most of the low cost wireless systems, this produces a high quality image that you would have little to no difficulty identifying people in the video recordings.  I have three wireless systems, and they are no match to this system for image quality.  Not only is the resolution better, but the lighting is far superior to my other systems.  In my wireless systems, it drops to gray scale quickly when the lighting is reduced.  These cameras stay in color much longer.  Each camera provides its own lighting.  There is a power and separate video to each camera.Setup is mostly intuitive. Unlike the other reviewers, I actually set my system up and used it. There is a very detailed manual online. I glanced through it, but it was easier to just explore the menu by right clicking my mouse.  The software is quite intuitive, too. If you want to set up the email, that will require getting down into the details, a lot like the early XP days using Outlook.  You’ll have to read enough to find the default logon password. You’ll need to change it because it is too simple.  Otherwise, you don’t really need to read much of anything to know how to connect things together.  You will have to provide a computer monitor or even a television set with a HDMI cable input. Bigger is better for the monitor if you have 16 cameras connected to it.  They supply the HDMI cable and the wired mouse.  There’s no keyboard, but it would be nice to have a keyboard for setup, although it’s not at all necessary.  A short Ethernet cable is provided, but unless you are lucky, you will likely need a longer one.  Heed the warning not to arbitrarily shut down the power.  You need to click on the lower left hand book symbol and select the shutdown button and allow it to shut down in an orderly fashion.  Remember that this is essentially a computer inside with a lot of analog camera cables connected to it.  They supply a remote control, but I didn’t see any need to use it.You do not need a Wi-Fi wireless network to set up and use this security system.  In fact, within an hour of opening the box, you can set up a test bench on your dining room table and connect a half dozen cameras to test it.  There are 10 rolls of 60 foot video/power cable for each camera.  You’ll be surprised when you lift this box and realize how heavy it is.  That is mostly the cables that weigh so much. In addition to a hard wired system, there are smart phone apps you can download and see all the cameras remotely.  At first, I used a power line internet adapter, but today I decided it was better to use a hard wired Ethernet cable to connect directly to my cable modem.  That way there are two less components (transmitter and receiver) to get in the path of the internet. Getting access to this security system via my smart phone took a long time before I finally saw the images.  Yesterday when my wife installed the app, we had no difficulty getting connected, but today we couldn’t get any image to come up after logging onto the system remotely.  We installed the app on two other smart phones and still couldn’t get the image.  We got onto the site, just couldn’t get an image like we did yesterday. We are probably doing something wrong.  I’m not concerned yet because we did see it work yesterday.  And the video was pretty good.  If you have a large screen phablet, it’ll be an asset.Obviously, this is a hard wired system, so that can be a downside to residential property that is already constructed. On the other hand, you don’t have to be concerned about linking all the cameras together wirelessly and be dead in the water if the network goes down. Business installations have more flexibility with drop ceilings and the likes.  And often you don’t mind some cables that are exposed.  Wires are much more reliable than a wireless system – except perhaps for the connectors sometimes.  Even if your home is already constructed, you can usually drill and drop cables in the interior walls if there is no insulation or fire blocks inside the walls. It takes some careful measurements and finding good reference points. I installed wiring in my walls for my 7.1 channel home theater system and my measurements worked perfectly.  In my attic, I specifically used insulation batting and not blown in insulation so that I can lift up sections and drill into the walls  and I can still get to the eaves of the roof to install some cameras at strategic locations on my two story house.  I will hire somebody to do that – too dangerous for me. Also, it’s still too hot in the attic here in the Houston area.  I can still install some cameras in the meantime, however.Pros:1. Okay, I show several cons, but except for one item, they are in the trivial department. The pros are well covered in the marketing literature.2. I’ve already mentioned most of the pros in my text above. It’s a very good system and these days you really do need security monitoring.  It’s costly, but safety always comes at a price. I live in a gated community as an extra layer of security, but living next to the lake still seems to attract too many undesirables.  I plan to sell and move anywhere except next to a lake but still don’t know a place that is better.  I left Dallas because my home was burglarized while I was taking a shower and two other times an attempted burglary occurred while my wife, young children and I were actually home.  Nice neighborhood, but too convenient to freeway getaways. Three-fourths of the homes had been burglarized at least twice, some three times.  Sorry for getting off subject.3. I’m planning to build a custom home starting next year. I will buy a more expensive version of this system and install it instead of this model. There are lots of variations of cameras, so I might end up with a different configuration. But absolutely, I will build in a Q-See security video surveillance system during the construction phase.Q-See QT8516-8Z8-2 16 Channel HD 3 MP/1080p NVR System with 8 High-Definition IP 3 MP/1080p Cameras and 2 TB Hard Drive (White)Almost All Minor Cons:1. I’ve got only one significant complaint and that is the surprisingly noisy fan inside the recorder unit.  I don’t know why that fan has to be so loud. I’m tempted to take it apart and replace it with a quieter fan – but it’s probably not practical. The air being blown out is cool, so there can’t be much heat being generated inside.  I want to install it above some cabinets upstairs in my home theater room, but it is just too distracting to put it in the open area.  You can easily notice the noise across the hallway and into one of the bedrooms.  So if burglars break into the house and see all the cameras, they can easily follow the noise trail to the video recorder.2. The 16 BNC connectors in the rear are spaced much too close to each other.  It is a real challenge to both twist the connector on or off after the first column is filled. I had to use long nose pliers to do it and even that was difficult.  There isn’t a huge amount of space on the rear, but they should have used all of it so that spacing is better. Granted you shouldn’t have to do it all that often, but it should have been done better than this. If it had been RCA plugs, it would have been easier.  I do understand that BNC connectors lock in place, but I think a lot of people will just push the connector onto the receptacle and not lock it.  And that’s not a good thing to do.3. Best for new home construction and businesses. It just takes more work to install it in preexisting residential homes.  People who install alarms systems may be good people to contact to get the more dangerous outside work done.  It will cost significant money to do it right.  I’m contracting the external dangerous work.  I am installing the inside cabling myself.  I’m 71 years old and I don’t expect it to be so terribly difficult.  I’ve already installed wiring inside the walls for my four rear speakers for my home theater system. It does require a lot of careful planning however.4. Minor point. It says it can record at 30 frames per second, but the only options I could find was 15 frames per second.  Movie theaters use 24 frames, so it appears 15 frames is okay.  I didn’t see any difference when I walked past the cameras.  Maybe it defaulted to 30 fps somehow. Whatever the case, it looked fine.5. Minor point. The resolution of 720 is okay, but you can readily see the difference in quality compared to 1080P.6. Minor point. I wish the color had been white instead of black to better blend with the white ceilings.  They do offer cameras in white color on other systems they manufacture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSRSM1R5D32G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY9J7CO#wasThisHelpful","RZSRSM1R5D32G","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has her home office set up in our breakfast nook and in the summer, it gets uncomfortably hot there on the southwest corner of our home. I’ve opened the air register fully open and tried to balance the other vents, but it’s just the way the house was built. I rolled this DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner next to the corner window, opened it up a little, placed the adjustable vent inside and finally got the flexible hose inserted and turned it on. It has a nice remote control that includes all the functions found on the main unit.  It was 77 degrees when we turned it on and after 1½ hours, it was down to 74 degrees. It adjoins a large open living area so I wasn’t expecting the temperature to change rapidly. It rained today, so it was much cooler than usual. So this isn’t the example I’d hoped to use.  I will try to remember to update the test in a few days when it returns to seasonable Houston temperatures.Also, for a very long time, I’ve wanted a way to cool my garage enough to work there sometimes during the hot Houston summers.  My two car garage is little bigger than the 500 square feet the manufacturer says it will handle.  But I just need the air temperature in my work area to become more tolerable.  The windows in my garage are fixed and I don’t want to modify anything yet.  So I opened my garage door a few inches – just barely enough to place the rectangular hose reducer under the garage door to exhaust the air from the DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner. I plugged the 20 foot long air gap under the garage door with a long piece of doubled over 3½ inch thick fiberglass insulation.  The garage door still leaves a gap at the top, but it doesn’t matter much because the displaced hot air can escape out of it because the hottest air rises to the ceiling.Even though it isn’t the most efficient arrangement, it does cool down my local working area in the garage. A few days ago, it was 83 degrees when I started and within a little over an hour, it was already down to 78 degrees as measured on the air conditioner unit. Now if I walked away from the air conditioner, it warmed up quickly. It needs much more time than an hour to cool a large area.  However, there was plenty of refrigerated cool air blowing toward where I was working and it felt quite pleasant. I checked the exhaust air coming out of the hose I put under the garage door and it was definitely hot as you’d expect.I planned to calculate the cost of operation, but we have a rather complex electricity billing system locally with split peak and off-peak and even seasonable adjustments.  For residential areas, it costs 14¢ per kilowatt hour during the summer during the peak cost. This is likely the time I’d use it the most, so 14¢ times 3.8 kilowatts comes to 53¢ per hour.  From 10 PM until 6 AM, it becomes much cheaper – so cheap I can hardly believe it is correct.  But the website says it is only 2.5¢ per hour, so it would cost less than 10¢ per hour to use it late at night.  Of course, electricity cost varies greatly across the United States, so these figures only apply here where I live.This DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner is kind of noisy, certainly not quiet.  If you plan to use it while sleeping, it might take several days to acclimate to the fan and compressor noise. If you’re a light sleeper, you may need to double check if you can tolerate the noise.  I wish the exhaust hose was a little longer for my garage application, but the supplied length works quite well for indoor rooms. I found it very difficult to get this accordion style stretch hose to go into the fittings they supplied – kept coming out.  I had to balance it just right for it to stay put.  I think I’ll have to drill some holes and use screws, washers and nuts to make it stay put, assuming I can even get it inside the fitting.I think I read somewhere that it only takes ten minutes to get it set up and working. Maybe that’s true if you’ve already done it a few times, but at least a half hour is needed the first time and maybe double that. When I received this, it was double boxed with no apparent damage. However, the bottom of the manufacturer’s original box on the inside was almost broken out, so I just laid the box on its side, cut some tape and removed the Styrofoam bottom. When I set the box back upright, all I had to do was lift off the box – ready to roll. The delivery person cautioned not to lift the shipping box by the bands because they can sometimes break and the sharp edges of the straps can slice your hands open. So I cut the bands off with scissors before I did anything. The box is definitely on the heavy side – team lift label.In summary, this DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner appears to be very well built and I think it fully performs as advertised. I certainly plan to make good use of it in the coming years, so I have no hesitation to give it a five star rating.  I particularly like the portability aspect and the overall appearance.  I read a review or two comparing this to a window air conditioning unit. That is a different application – fixed unit hanging out of your window.  This  DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner is one that you can roll around to different parts of your home or business and you only need 110 volts via a three prong receptacle, not 220 volts.  You do need a place to exhaust the hot air, but otherwise, it is quite portable. It does not roll around on carpet easily, but tile floors like I have make it easy to move.  Don’t consider taking it up stairs. It’s quite heavy – 76 pounds shipping weight according to the Amazon product details spec.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9BNFZPIPUR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085SKGEO#wasThisHelpful","RA9BNFZPIPUR5","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was really, really difficult to spend this much money on a seat cushion, but it is very comfortable compared to the others I tried and wasted money. The gel seat cushion is not very thick, but it is deceivingly comfortable. The back side is non-slip and that is extremely useful to keep it from sliding around on the seat. It just stays put in the original spot.  So that allows you to scoot around a little to readjust your bottom periodically.  It is considerably heavier than you'd expect of a seat cushion. I purchase both this model and the car seat version with the seat back cushion and both are inside our 2014 Honda Accord.  The seat hardness of the Honda Accord was one of my pet peeves when I purchased this car, so now that has been solved for about $200.  I may even purchase another of these seat cushions for airline travel. The car cushion is wider and I don't think I can fit it inside my carryon luggage outside pocket. I kept looking for this cushion in the photo with the young woman and her leg kept capturing my attention. The cushion is against the luggage handle in case you couldn't find it, either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUNUATTVEWUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX40DKI#wasThisHelpful","RDUNUATTVEWUW","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2009 I purchased a  TRENDnet SecurView Wireless Day/Night Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance Camera TV-IP422W (White) for $160 and I never could get it to work via the internet or even wirelessly.  This new model appears to be a significantly updated version of the surveillance camera I originally purchased.  So I was very hopeful I could finally get some use out of my prior generation surveillance with more advanced network control software with this latest generation surveillance camera.Getting this to work with a smart phone is not particularly difficult if you don't make any mistakes along the way, but really pay close attention as you go. The image from this surveillance camera appears to default to grayscale quite often even in fairly well lit rooms, but it does provide color in better lighting. The image quality via what they call the Cloud Camera is quite poor and generally everything is surprisingly blurred. You absolutely could not make a positive ID on anyone if that ever became a requirement. And that's here in my room using my desktop computer on the same network. It's about the same on the cell phone except smaller image size.  I’ve gone into the profiles and set every parameter I can to improve the video quality and nothing makes the image quality any better.There is a separate application for Windows 7 (quite likely works on Windows 10 as well) that provides a multi camera view like you would see in a central security control room of a commercial building. I installed it, but I cannot get an image – apparently multiple network setup parameters I haven’t entered or entered incorrectly. If you are a network specialist well acquainted with all the network buzzwords and terminology, then you are probably comfortably in your domain.  But for mere mortals, this is out of our league.If you want a simple installation that is easy and quick to set up, you will be far more satisfied with a Summer Infant Baby Link Wi-Fi Internet Viewing Camera, Link Wi-Fi Series.  Even though the title has the word baby in it, it’s still basically a surveillance system. It will give you a view of what's happening in your home and it will be in color most of the time with moderate lighting and complete with two way audio. And you can remotely pan the camera up and down and side to side.  If you want a video surveillance system that sounds an alarm and sends intruder alarms to you via text messages, then the Guardzilla GZ502B All-In-One Video Security System (Black) may be what you prefer. It provides you with a nice image usually in color in decent lighting. However, it has a fixed position and the camera cannot pan around the room like the other products.  I have all three of these products.  I use the Summer Infant Baby Link the most - and there are no children living at home. So just disregard the word Baby in its description.This Trendnet HD Wireless Day, Night Cloud surveillance camera also includes an application called TRENDnetVIEW PRO.  It is clearly a professional grade application. While it has an extensive user’s guide for every aspect of operation, you'll still need a vocabulary of network buzzwords and know exactly what they mean and how to enter all the hieroglyphs of network language. If you are comfortable in this environment, then this is for you. If I had about a week to study up on all this and made a series of phone calls to customer support, I could probably get this to work. However, I'm just not that inclined to do it at this time, especially when the video image is so blurred I can barely recognize my own wife.  If I get it to work someday, I'll update this review. I don't give up very easily.Here is the jargon you can expect from customer service below. If you understand this, then you'd probably be able to get the professional software to work. I want learn enough to get my old TrendNet surveillance camera to work with this application, but it appears not to be compatible so far.  Maybe if I understood all the lingo and terminology much better, I think I might be able to get my old one to work on the same network and control both surveillance cameras.Okay, here is the exact text from customer support so that I don't mislead anyone. Maybe it is just my ignorance of network terminology that is the issue - although I've been setting up home networks for a decade without too much difficulty. But I'll freely admit that I'm no expert with networking.  I'll copy their much longer first response as a comment so that I don't waste a lot of space here in the main part of this review.----------------------------When you add the TV-IP862IC to this software you cannot use the camera URL.  You must use the IP address that has been assigned to the camera.  You should be able to find this in your router’s DHCP client list.  We would recommend that you use your router’s DHCP reservation option to ensure the camera is always assigned the same IP address.  For example, if your router assigned the camera an IP address of 192.168.10.105 you would add it to the TRENDnetVIEW Pro application using this IP address and not the http://xxxxxxxxx.cam.trendnetcloud.com address.Each camera is essentially an IP address and a port number with a username and password.  Please provide a phone number and an available time Monday ~ Friday 6:30am to 5:00pm Pacific time and we can have a third level support representative assist you through this process.  Difficulty is relative and if there are issues, we have support avenues to help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYKDNRDWNH0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","R2PYKDNRDWNH0G","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After agonizing over the price for weeks, I finally decided to buy this for my 2014 Honda Accord and I have not regretted it for a minute. I have it on the passenger side as my wife does most of the driving nowadays. The seat height cannot be adjusted.  I am six feet tall and with this cushion, I really have to duck my head to get in the car and that's difficult after major neck surgery last year.  I have bumped my head countless times.  It's not all that thick, so that came as a surprise. But once inside, it is much more comfortable that the factory car seat. I bought a smaller version for my wife, so I've been out close to $200 on two car seat cushions - worth it as it turns out.  Of course, I still think it is way overpriced.I am less enthusiastic with the seat back cushion.  It is different than the seat cushion - not nearly as good.  I'm using as a leg rest on my recliner instead of the originally intended use.  If you don't specifically need a back rest, you can save considerable money by getting only the car seat cushion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35V1VHZW88OJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IO3KQPO#wasThisHelpful","R35V1VHZW88OJU","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:20 Mins I am very impressed and also exceedingly pleased to own this carpet cleaner.  I included a short video so you can see how it sucks up the dirty water from the sample carpet that I've been using at the front door to my home.  My wife slowed down on the back and forth strokes after making this video.  I pays to go slower and give more time - especially to suck up the dirty water.  It does a very good job of removing the water from the carpet and it dries within an hour or two, but it will vary depending on the type and thickness of the carpet.  I should have taken a photo of the dirty brown water in the catch reservoir. It was very brown - almost shockingly so.  The carpet looked like new when we finished.  There are some brush strokes in the after photo, but that was just because of the direction of the final passes.  It disappeared after we walked on it.I've had an small thin area rug over the large tiles in our kitchen for six years and even though we vacuum it often, it really needed to be wet cleaned. It was getting to the point I was planning to put it in the garage to catch foot traffic before it got inside the house.  Needless to say, it looks like new now.  There was one three inch food stain I thought would never come clean - been there for years. Gone. I did prep it with an enzyme cleaner beforehand, but it didn't seem to make much of an effect, if any.There were three small mysterious stains in an upstairs bedroom that were there before we bought this newly constructed home. You couldn't see them with visible light, but when I used a strong UV flashlight, I could see them.  Thanks to this Bissell carpet cleaner, the spots are completely gone now.  Impossible to know now, but their origin may have been pet stains.  From what I have discovered thus far, the more you go over an area, especially sucking up the dirty water, the better. Don't expect magic by whizzing over the rug or carpet in a fast motion.  Go slow and give it time to wash the carpet.  There is very good brush action and I like that they made the head transparent so you can see when you've gotten most of the dirty water removed.The instructions say to use 1.25 ounces of their soap concentrate for the quick clean. I wish they would use volumetric units instead of weight.  I had to measure a small plastic container of their concentrated soap with kitchen scales to know how much 1.25 ounces was.  After that, it was easy and no need to measure it by weight.  And if you have a large area of carpet to clean, I think you'll need to purchase more bottles of the concentrated soap before you start.  It really works well, but there are limits, even to magic. I am glad they supplied the two samples with the carpet cleaner.  The instructions say to run your hot water until it gets to 140 degrees F.  I have my hot water heater limit purposely set to 130 degrees to help reduce the risk of scalding.  But even at this starting temperature, it works very well.When you get this carpet cleaner, do pay very close attention to the instructions on how to assemble the handle.  My wife is normally pretty good with mechanical assembly, but she ignored the little sign and snapped the orange plastic piece onto the carpet cleaner before she tried to insert the handle.  A few days passed and she told me there was something wrong with the handle - wouldn't stay attached.  Well, she didn't mention that she had already snapped the side plastic piece onto the cleaner.  I was baffled for a while until I started reading the instructions.  Then it was not so easy to remove that orange plastic piece.  I gambled on how to pull it off and fortunately nothing broke.  I do think they could have make it more clear about the assembly sequence.  For one thing, don't color that orange piece blue and show it going on, not already in place. Anyway, that is all history now - mostly forgotten.  There are some advertising signs that they glue on that is terribly difficult to remove.  It leaves an ugly glue residue that I had to apply with Goo Gone to get rid of it.  Use tape, not industrial strength glue. There is a substantial hose accessory kit, but I don't have an immediate need to use it yet, so I haven't tried it.  But I'm sure I will.I've sometimes rented carpet cleaners similar to this in the distant past. I don't have good memories of their performance - nothing approaching this level or I'd remember it.  I think this carpet cleaner is well worth the current asking price.  It appears to me to be a bargain if you consider what it costs for standard dry vacuum cleaners these days.  You should still use a dry vacuum cleaner to remove as much dirt as possible before using this wet carpet cleaner.  However, you'll soon realize how much dirt you are leaving behind after you use this carpet cleaner.  I wouldn't hesitate to spend this much money for this hot water carpet cleaner.  I'm just surprised I hadn't already purchased it.  Bissell is a great brand - very good reputation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13A7NYT9HGHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R13A7NYT9HGHA","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once you get this Guardzilla security monitor set up, it works quite well.  However the setup process is less than ideal as you can see by the number of frustrated people giving it a one star rating.  My wife set this up a couple of weeks ago and followed the instructions to the letter and still had difficulties for whatever reason.  She had to start over several times or redo certain entries but eventually it worked.  She didn’t really do anything differently each time that I can recall.  So we’ve been testing it to determine how it behaves during normal everyday situations.It has a setting for an alarm whenever somebody walks in the path of its coverage.  I chose 5 seconds which is the minimum time. And if you choose, you can have it send a text message to your phone or an email or both.  And it will give you a short video clip of the intruder event so you can see who or what it was that set it off.  I think I recall once where the intruder (wife) walked past it quickly and the video clip missed her entirely even though the alarm was triggered.A few days ago, we started having problems with our cable internet modem and it had to be replaced – nothing to do with this Guardzilla security monitor.  Of course, the new Wi-Fi unit had a different password which was its serial number.  So my wife started trying to set up the new password in the Guardzilla monitor. After about 45 minutes, she was ready to throw it on the floor. She could not get Guardzilla to show up on the wireless network list in her smart phone.I noticed the small reset button, but she said she already tried that numerous times.  So with that information, I decided upon a more thorough way to reset the Guardzilla monitor.  I’m a retired electrical engineer and back nearly half a century ago, I dealt with reset circuitry and know how it should work.  I pressed the reset button continuously while pulling out the power plug, waited about ten seconds with the reset button still pressed and then plugged in the power plug – but still holding the reset button for yet another five or ten seconds.  Just to reiterate, I pressed the reset button continuously while removing power, waiting ten seconds for internal capacitive voltage to dissipate and still held it another five or so seconds after plugging the power back into the connector.  The number of seconds doesn’t have to be exact.Now I’m not saying this will universally solve all the problems people have been having.  Maybe it was just a little luck or even coincidence with my particular unit.  My wife was rather disgusted that I got it to work so quickly and I don’t blame her. If she had gotten a good power-on clear or reset, maybe she would have gotten it to work without any assistance. Power reset (initialization) is often a culprit with electronics that doesn’t have a bulletproof startup or reset design.  When you plug in the power, the electronics states are unpredictable how they will initialize.  Normally, there is a master reset circuit that initializes all the components inside to a known starting state.  Nowadays the electronic circuits are integrated at such a high level of sophistication that it is difficult to get off to a clear start. Again, this is speculation on my part.  The problems others are having may be something unrelated, but it’s still worthwhile to try – only takes a few seconds.So back to how well it is working after it was set up.  I tested most all the modes in reasonable detail and everything works as it should.  The lens is very wide angle and there is considerable distortion of the image – significant curving of the image on all four sides. This is quite common for cheap low cost wide angle lenses. However, I think they need to find a better lens because the distortion is so much it affects how well you can identify anyone.  The alarm emits a steady tone and is fairly loud, but not deafening.  Periodically, the Guardzilla unit makes a series of annoying clicking noises which sounds like an unusually loud mechanical relay inside.  I don't know what it is doing while making these annoying clicking sounds, but one benefit is I know when my wife is spying on me with her smart phone when she’s out shopping.So for the price, this is a good device definitely worthy of consideration.  I knocked off one star for the clicking sound and the difficulty in setting up the network. And it should have a better quality lens, too. The instructions for network setup appear to be correct, but some electronics inside the unit appear to be getting hung up during setup and it won’t display the Guardzilla on the network list.  Hopefully a good thorough reset will clear it before you start trying to set up the network. I only have one unit, so I can’t speak for the other people.  Somewhere it says a second Guardzilla security device can be added. Usually you do need more than one camera for adequate security monitoring.  So it is good that their app can accommodate a second security camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5H57BBZI1YYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEKXJ6U#wasThisHelpful","R5H57BBZI1YYS","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put these female connectors on my three outside water faucets.  You can purchase the Hoselink Garden Hose Connector Starter Kit, but you'll probably still need to buy one or two of these female connectors.  I put Hoselink connectors on every hose sprayer I own.I was testing two pairs in my kitchen before actually going outside and connecting them to the outside faucets and water hoses. At first I thought it would be very difficult to completely twist lock the pairs in place.  But to my surprise after I connected them to the outdoor faucet, they snapped right into place without much effort - even the first time. It was hot outside, so that may have made a difference. Now they disconnect and connect easily - but still takes a firm grip. However, it feels good to hear them snap in place.  Gives a nice feeling of confidence they are going to stay locked in place. Maybe I've gotten used to it now because I don't even think about it anymore - second nature now. My petite 5' 2"" wife handles them with ease, too.We worked outside for about five hours pressure washing our concrete driveway.  We used three pairs of the connectors during that time and none leaked even one drop of water - very tight seal. Previously, I had purchased some brass quick connectors and I was very disappointed with the constant leaking.  That is what motivated me to try these quick connectors. They are made of solid nylon - no metal parts, which is good in my book.Once you attach them to your faucets or sprayers, you just twist the pair together and you don't have to bother threading them onto a hose. It makes really quick work of it and I don't even hesitate to swap heads if needed. Before, I probably would just keep using one head rather than unscrewing it and screwing another one on. I do put an inline brass valve on my hoses so I don't have to go back to the main faucet to turn off the water.  You can hot swap these, but you'll probably get wet if you do.  I tried it just to see and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I tried to keep out of the spray stream. I think if I practiced it enough, I could minimize the spray better.Although it is purely optional, I did use the yellow locking tabs. I wondered what the purpose was because the connectors I got certainly weren't going to twist loose on their own in my lifetime. The yellow tabs work fine.  I haven't had any difficulty with any of them.  They click in and pull out with little effort. I did notice that most of the yellow tabs were loose and not inserted in the twist lock quick connectors, but at the time I didn't realize they were optional.  There were a considerable number of spare O-rings included . It seems like the o-rings are extremely well embedded into their grooves on the mating connectors, so it is difficult to believe they would ever get damaged under normal use. It seems like they would last a lifetime. However, I do like having spare parts on hand.I tested three pairs of connections in-line at full pressure.  I think I remember the house inspector saying my water pressure was quite high - about 60 psi. I left the water on with a brass stop valve at the end for at least two hours - not a drop of water leaked on any of them.I was impressed that the white locator tabs all ended up facing directly outward on the outdoor faucets on my house. I was expecting the white locator tabs to end up facing the house where I couldn't see them.  Maybe I was just lucky. This seems like a rock solid design to me.  I really like them.  I bought several female connectors to balance the set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SE6PG6RJZS19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3V3KM8#wasThisHelpful","R1SE6PG6RJZS19","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have four computers and two DVD players on Actiontec power line adapters throughout my two-story house.  My main complaint is that they drop the download speed quite dramatically depending upon the branch wiring.  If I measure the download speed of a hard wired laptop computer directly to the cable modem, I get 50 mb/s download speed very consistently, never less.  Usually the best I get with these Actiontec adapters is 35 mb/sec, which is far below the specification. Oddly, sometimes I can get 50 mp/sec on an electrical outlet on the very same AC circuit about 10 feet away. But most of the time that same outlet only gets 35 mb/sec while the direct connection off the back of the modem is 50 mb/sec. I don't understand why it changes speed.Otherwise the nominal download speed elsewhere in the house is only about 25 mb/sec, which is half what I get at the modem.  So I have wasted a lot of money buying these 500 mb/sec power line adapters.  I should have purchased the cheapest ones, 200 mb/sec. I can get a better download speed using wireless to the modem - 35 to 50 mb/sec.I had one Actiontc 500 mb/s Power Line Adapter module hard fail last month after about a year of service, so I thought I needed to replace it.  A few days ago, I bought this on a one-day sale for more than one-third off the normal price. So it was worth it at that price. I had a price trigger at camelcamelcamel that alerted me via email. So my three star rating is for one hard failure but mostly the major drop in Ethernet speed from the modem.The main advantage of this unit is the quad output, which is useful for my home theater system.  I have multiple electronics that need Ethernet connectivity.  I now have a surplus of Actiontec power line adapters, so I will have spares if any fail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPW5DTMLJFJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLESP70#wasThisHelpful","RTPW5DTMLJFJZ","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good concept, but it needs to be longer and wider to be more universally practical.  Most especially it needs to be longer - double length for starters.  And it needs to be wide and tall enough to handle the wall wart power supplies.  This covers only the most basic and simple televisions, and definitely not complex home theater systems with a computer attached. It isn't big enough for a complex computer system.

"Since April 2015, our family has been pure Blu.  As soon as we got our first Blu Unlocked Smart Phone in late February, we were hooked.  We sold off  all our Samsung smart cell phones. Blu simply gives you far more bang for the buck than any other cell phone. It may not always be as fast or have hundreds of options or features you’ll probably rarely if ever use, but it still has an abundance of features – certainly more than most people need.  And this Blu Studio 7.0 II is no exception.  Here is a quick list of pros and cons.Pros:- Excellent Display and Size – 7 inches diagonal screen (3 X 6 inches viewable)- Approximate Overall Dimensions – 4 X 7 X ' inches- Good signal sensitivity – 3 bars versus zero to one bar for Samsung Note 8 cell phone- Surprisingly good photo quality. Excellent light sensitivity on rear camera.- Although big for a cell phone, still narrow enough to hold to your ear- Can work as a tablet without a SIM card inserted. Connects to WiFi.- Very good battery life, especially considering it has a large 7 inch display.- Almost goes without saying it is unlocked.  Standard on Blu phones to my knowledge.Cons:- Weight –  A bit heavy, but not too much:  8.7 ounces, barely over half a pound.- No 4G.  Only 3 G reception. Seems like an oversight.  Should have 4G.- Front camera image resolution not so great – VGA only.- Needs tiny screwdriver to access the SIM card. Not so quick to change SIM card- Already had three SIM cards get stuck. Scary. Not changing SIMs anymore.Blu Wish List:- Wish it had 4G, including LTE and keep under $200 for everything below.- Higher speed CPU such as Blu Vivo Air:  2 GHz and 8 Cores.- Better camera resolution like the newest Blu Selfie camera with Sony Camera.- Offer Selfie style monopods for all Blu Cell Phones.- Quick Change Replaceable batteries.- Robust Quick Change SIM cards that don't get jammed or stuck.My wife is an avid user of a BLU phones. Even though she uses her cell phone for hours each day, she still insists staying in budget for high tech gadgets – and that includes cell phones.  That’s why she is such a fan of Blu cell phones.  Otherwise she likes Blu phones because they come with the complete package: Headset, case and screen protector. She says this Blu Studio 7.0 II smart phone is easy to use, but I should point out that she has been using Blu cell phones for several months now.She owned a big heavy 8 inch Samsung Note 8 cell phone for about a year before giving it to her sister.  So she was familiar with the phablet size. However, this Blu Studio 7.0 II phone is much easier for her to hold to her ear (more narrow) compared to the Samsung Note 8.  The Blu Studio 7.0 II is unquestionably fits her hand much better. She is petite, 5 feet 2 inches tall. It fits in her purse nicely and compared to small phones, it is very easy to find it when she gets a phone call.One thing she especially likes is that she can use this Blu Studio 7.0 II phone as a tablet only.  It’s even a good price for a tablet only - very good size, image quality and affordable.  Photos when using the main camera are very good. The image on the screen is very near that of seeing it live in person, including the lighting. It is not overly saturated with color and the light intensity did not overly darken when taken indoors with natural lighting. What you see is very nearly what you get, but we haven’t tested it exhaustively. She also listens to music with the included earphone and has watched several full length videos. She is so pleased with the bright image and the clarity of the sound.This phone has numerous nice to have features.- It is unlocked phone and has a good 7 inch size with Android 5.0 Lollipop.- It has 8GB internal storage 1GB RAM. You can expand up to 64GB with a micro SD slot.- The main camera is 5MP and is more than adequate for most photography.- Consider the BLU Selfie cell phone for more demanding photos and videos.Photo left to right: Blu Studio 7.0 II, Energy X Plus, Life One, Selfie and Vivo Air","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH3CQWM6MLMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013X0V11K#wasThisHelpful","R2IH3CQWM6MLMS","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This size Large is made for a person much heavier than I am - trying to be tactful.The fabric is not quite as soft as I prefer, but as you'd expect for cotton material. There is a gray liner around the inside of the collar which, although it can't be seen, is a nice touch. The sewing is very high quality with no loose threads, missing stitches or the likes. It should last a long time. The red color is about the same as the image on my computer monitor, so no surprises there. The length of the sleeves are longer on me than the photo - almost reaching my elbow when I bend my arm. It's another indicator I got a size that's too big. So consider ordering a size smaller than you usually wear.I checked the sizing chart and I still couldn't have known what to order.  I often buy my clothes from Penney's just so I can try them on for fit. If the price is reasonable, that's where I buy it.  If it isn't a good price, then I'll try to find it here on Amazon, but only after verifying the fit and material in a brick and mortar store.Anyway, depending upon the manufacturer, I wear anything from small to a large.  For the same actual fit, the sizing label can vary from Small to Medium to Large - no way to know without trying it on for fit.  I have a 16 inch neck, 43 inch chest and the arm length doesn't matter too much since this is a short sleeved shirt. The chart says I need a size Large. What the chart is missing is the gut or stomach size. The shirt is 50 inches at the waist and I'm 38 inches. Obviously I can wear this shirt, but I really dislike a shirt billowing out around my waist – makes me look fatter than I already am. I think I may need a size Small, but then I run the risk of it being too tight in the shoulders and chest.So depending upon your body build, you may need to adjust the size you order accordingly and maybe order one for a trial sample.  That’s what I do. Then if it fits, I order one of every color and two of my favorite colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URQEKJ653BM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7IUBO#wasThisHelpful","R1URQEKJ653BM9","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thank goodness I had a preexisting solid AMD back plate!  The universal plate they include is universally impossible to ever mount because the screws keep getting pushed out before you can ever get them threaded - assuming you don't count cross threading them and ruining the threads.  If I had not purchased some other mounting kit which had the real AMD plate with permanently mounted screws, then I would have rated this cooler much lower.  In my particular case it is next to perfect.The main thing I like is the flexible hoses.  My previous piece of high priced junk failed and sprayed antifreeze inside my case.  I was so extremely fortunate that it sprayed the fluid against the side cover and drained into the bottom of the case and onto my tile floor where I saw it before burning up my CPU.  I wish they had shown the air flow direction on the separate fan they enclosed.  It took me a lot of time searching on the internet to find consistent opinions of the air flow direction. Most fans have the air flow direction and rotation molded into the plastic frame, but not Antec.I wanted to use a different quieter fan for the separate fan, but apparently Antec's controller wants its brand connected to it.  I tried to connect the separate fan directly to the motherboard pins, but the Antec controller noticed that and ran the fans at an extremely noisy speed continuously. Once I finally gave up and used the stock Antec fan, the fan speed dropped at least in half to a manageable noisy level. I don't know how anyone can stand the fan noise in the so called Performance Mode.  Maybe if you had a noise canceling headset with the volume turned up loud, it wouldn't be quite as objectionable.The CPU cooler comes with thermal compound, but good luck trying to keep it from getting messed up while you are trying to get the mounting screw nuts screwed onto the main mounting plate.  I know my compound is really messed up, but I wasn't about to redo it after finally getting those mounting nuts in place.  I am running a high performance AMD CPU at 4.6 GHz.  It's base speed is 4 GHz.  I'd run it at base speed except it doesn't seem stable there.  I used the Asus utility to find the optimum speed and that seems to be 4.6 GHz is the magic speed for some reason.The ambient temperature at my desk is 78 degrees and the CPU temperature is 40 C or 104 F.  The fan speed is 1022 RPM.  The fan speed was well under 1000 RPM back when the outside temperature was not so hot.  The fan noise is noticeable now, but when it was about 850 RPM in the spring, it wasn't bad at all.  I wish I could install a quieter secondary fan on this water cooled assembly.  I really do not like fan noise.  My wife's desktop computer is virtually silent, but it also is less than half the performance of my computer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHORXEEMOVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2WTLIS#wasThisHelpful","R2JHORXEEMOVP2","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite shirts ever in my entire 71 year life.  They are soft and fit perfectly.  They come out of the dryer without needing ironing - except maybe the collars need to be pressed to keep their original shape.  I bought one of every color and two of colors I wear more often.  I originally found these shirts in JC Penney and fortunately found they are exactly the same on Amazon.The size is way off in my opinion.  I am exactly six feet tall and weigh 185 pounds and I have to wear a size small. I don't like a loose fit. These fit me perfectly in the small size. Not tight with a little room to spare.  The arms are a little tight, however.  That's why I'm glad I discovered them in JC Penney so that I could try them on first to know with certainty that they would fit me.These shirts have about the most scratchy tags I've ever seen sewn into a shirt.  But a few quick snips with sharp scissors rectifies that rather quickly.  I will never understand the logic of why tags need to be sewn into clothing in this day and age.  And why manufacturers pick the worst possible material to use as tags is another thing I'll never understand.  This is not unique to these shirts.  They are all that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9DWYJVUIJUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ2X6M2#wasThisHelpful","R3F9DWYJVUIJUT","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cell phone would be almost ideal if it had a replaceable battery two or three times as high capacity.  I don't care how thin the phone is as long as it doesn't sacrifice a reasonable battery life between charges. I haven't owned a phone yet that didn't require a battery replacement within a couple of years and my most recent Samsung required a battery replacement in less than a year.  I hope this battery is different, but I very strongly doubt it will last long considering I have to recharge it a couple of times per day.  So now my wife carries a big thick battery pack with a long cable connected to the skimpy battery in this Vivo Air Smartphone. That is the realistic scenario.The other thing I'd like to see improved is inclusion of 4G LTE.  But truthfully, it's really fast just as it is.  Regrettably I very recently purchased two of the new BLU Life One 4G LTE Smartphones with LTE.  With the Blu Vivo Air phone, I get 4 bars signal strength throughout my home, but both of the BLU Life One 4G LTE Smartphones get zero bars signal strength.  I'd return it except I can't find anything actually broken. If I drive directly under the cell tower, I do get 4 bars.  The cell tower is direct line of sight only one mile away across the lake.  I can see it from my windows.  So now I've moved the SIM card back to this Vivo Air phone.I will sell the two Life One 4G cell phones. I have a BLU Studio 6.0 HD Smartphone as well.  I like it except it is so big.  I wish they'd keep the display and trim off the top and lower parts of the phone to make it smaller. It's too long.  I've been a Samsung lover until I got this phone.  Then I sold both of my Samsung phones immediately.  Blu is a great value overall and the reliability has been very good so far.  So I'll probably keep buying this company's products.

"I bought a Norelco razor analogous to this about 14 or 15 years ago. Back then, it just didn’t give a very close shave, so I changed to Remington, then to Braun 7000 Series razor and then to my much more recent Panasonic ES8103S Arc3.  This new Norelco razor is two to three times as expensive as any razor I’ve ever purchased.  Mentally, I had a lot of reservations about how well it would compare to my Panasonic razor, which provides a very close shave. After being used to listening to the high speed Panasonic shaver, the Norelco sounded very slow in comparison. So mentally I was equating sound to performance.  Well, to my complete surprise, this Norelco shaves very nearly as close as a blade razor and definitely better than my Panasonic electric razor.  But this Norelco is about twice as expensive as the Panasonic model I have – not that there is always a direct correlation between price and performance.The first time I tried this Norelco razor, it had been at least two days since I shaved – more likely three days.  I was curious how well it would perform under those conditions because the Panasonic doesn’t handle two or three day beard growth very well.  The Panasonic razor seems like it has to gnaw its way down to the skin level – just takes a longer than usual. The Norelco definitely outperforms the Panasonic razor in this situation, but it also tugs on a few hairs along the way.Wet vs. Dry:I shaved for about four days straight with a dry shave.  And again, the result seems very comparable to a wet shave with a razor and shaving cream.  I won’t go so far to say it is exactly equal to a regular razor, but it’s surprisingly close – except on my neck where there are significant contours and wrinkles from age.  A standard razor does better on my neck. This razor claims it has multiple degrees of freedom to contour to the shape of your face and neck.  And on my cheeks, it works great.  And it does a good job on my neck as well, but not quite as good as a razor shave with water and shaving cream.  In my opinion, this Norelco shaves closer overall than my Panasonic razor.I inserted the liquid container into the base of the Norelco shaver and plugged in the charger unit and watched and listened to it go through a series of strange sounding grinding and gnawing noises.  It takes a short while to finish its cycle.  So after I saw it puddle up the blue liquid under the razor’s head, I started shaving not knowing what to expect. It felt slightly oily on my skin, lacking a better word to describe it.  It didn’t seem to have much, if any odor.The base unit will take up a fair amount of space on your countertop.  You charge it with the shaver heads facing down and then you press the upper structure to start charging the shaver.  Press it again and it raises up to remove it.  At first, that wasn’t so obvious since I don’t tend to read instructions unless I get into difficulty. After I shave, I pop off the shaver head assembly and use a can of compressed air to blow out the beard dust before returning it to the charger unit.  If you need to trim your sideburns or mustache, you have to remove the triple rotating head and press on a separate edge trimmer that is included.  I still use my aging Braun shaver for that task, so it’s not an issue for me.  I have quite a collection of razors that all seem to have one specialty that is better than any other shaver.Anyway, if you have about $150 or so in your budget for an electric razor, this Norelco gives a very close shave that I haven’t personally experienced with any other razor. Admittedly, my closest competitive razor is the Panasonic razor at almost half the cost.  But you can’t always judge a product by what it costs.  But in this case, it seems to matter.  There is the potential inconvenience of popping off the razor’s head to use the head to use the edge trimmer.  It’s quick and easy, so it doesn’t take long to switch heads. It’s up to you whether that makes a difference. On a positive closing note, it does provide a surprisingly close shave.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TBDTOR44AI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R4TBDTOR44AI3","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Dyson and seeing is believing.  I've been reading about Dyson for years and I just couldn't get past the price to actually buy one.  Well, I finally got my wish and got one on the Amazon Vine program.  From the moment I first pulled the trigger on this vacuum cleaner, I became a instant believer. It puts all my Black & Decker battery powered vacuum cleaners to shame.  I almost didn't believe it and yet it was right here in my hands experiencing it first hand.  I looked in the dust collection chamber and there was so much stuff there - almost as good as my AC wall power vacuum cleaner.I really like the feel of the hand held unit. It fits my hand so well and the trigger feels so natural.  It doesn't feel heavy and it is not at all tiring to use it - very ergonomic design. After using it a while, I can feel the heat from the motor. I hope the battery holds up long term. For now, it holds a good charge for quite a while. I haven't used it long enough to run down the battery.  I ran it over 15 minutes and it showed no indication of the battery getting weaker. There's a power boost button for temporary tasks and it really works well. It's a little noisy, but different than the noise from a standard vacuum cleaner.  It's mostly noise from air being blown out of the head. It's not annoying to me.  When my wife uses the standard AC powered vacuum cleaner, I can't stand it and go to another part of the house until she finishes.The unit snaps together very easily and is disassembled just as easily. There is a dump lid to discharge the accumulated trash and it is fairly easy to use, but I think the release mechanism could have been designed better. Maybe with practice, it will become easier. There is an included wall mount with an attachment for the charger connector.  Be careful to route the wiring before you snap the connector in place. I was just experimenting with how well the connector would be retained and before I knew it, the power connector was permanently in place - and I had not routed the wire cable properly. I finally had to use a screwdriver to pry it out and was worried I might break the plastic retainer.  Now I know that power connector is never going to pulled out.I am going to sell off all my other vacuum cleaners and standardize on Dyson. I know the Dyson vacuum cleaners are quite expensive, but they have the performance to justify the price.  I read the brief history book that was included with this vacuum cleaner and I'm glad to see the engineer who designed this line of vacuum cleaners is still the owner.  Usually the inventors of any new technology end up being pushed out of the company once the financial people get their claws on the company. I have an even dozen patents myself and all I got was my photo hanging on the wall and a few patent plaques that I had to buy myself.  So I commend this rare man who reinvented the vacuum cleaner and is still thriving in his own company.  It means he is not purely driving by profits, but driven by his reputation and skill as a world class engineer.I did receive this vacuum cleaner on the Amazon Vine program. but I will use my own money to purchase some more Dyson vacuum cleaners now. I frequently end up buying additional products that I review on the Amazon Vine program. And this will be no exception.  So I clearly endorse this Dyson vacuum cleaner as being the best handheld vacuum I've ever used by far.  It's even better than some AC powered vacuums I have used. There is real modern engineering behind Dyson products - not just incremental improvements to units that have been around for over 50 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4RNPH7YR0UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJQ72#wasThisHelpful","R3V4RNPH7YR0UQ","A2AF0NOCM71J0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AF0NOCM71J0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always been drawn to Japan, it's culture and its people and it is in my top 5 list of places I want to visit one day. Naturally, I have read much over the years about Japan and its culture, but this has to be one of my most fun reads to date. The author touches and expounds on things from the very distant past to the modern present day seamlessly, with humor, insight and elegance that makes this a joy to read. The many photographs (with thoughtful yet to-the-point accompanying captions) dispersed throughout are such a pleasure to view and nearly transports the viewer into that moment. There is not a dry or boring passage in this book, it is thoroughly entertaining with many educational aspects as well. One of our teens, who is studying hiragana and katakana, as well as the spoken Japanese language, loves this book equally, so there is a lot of sharing going on both with this book and through discussion.

While the measurements of the wrap we received were slightly off (ours is about 37 1/2"" by 56""), she tried it on and it will still work for her purposes.

"I spent a lot of time researching various mandolins and reading reviews while needing to stay within a modest budget to get one of our daughters the best mandolin we could afford. I came across the Rogue mandolin and had decided that we'd get the best quality for the price point, but when I saw that for a small amount more, we could also get an extra full size guitar, which we very much need because all 3 of our daughters and I play guitar to varying degrees. This was one of the best musical instrument deals around in my opinion, because you just can't beat the price on these very nice quality instruments.The mandolin: this is simply a beautiful instrument both to my eyes and ears. The workmanship is very good, the action on the strings is better than I've seen on some much higher-priced mandolins. The strings that came with it were better quality than I had expected, and have not yet needed to replace them with the strings that I had purchased at the time I had placed this order. The first several times this is played, it will need to be somewhat re-tuned, but we expected that and now holds it's tune much longer in between. We are very, very pleased with this mandolin, it's just lovely all around.The guitar: this is a full-sized guitar, the sunburst finish was much prettier to me than in the photo, and is a well-constructed instrument. We have other guitars, and so are a little more picky and familiar with what we want/need and what to look for. We were not disappointed, this guitar is hard to beat at this price, even some I've tried in person at higher prices at my local music shop. The action is suprisingly good, and holds a tune very well. Again, I ended up not replacing the strings on the guitar that I assumed I would need to do, as the strings that were on it are just fine. The tone is fabulous, and does not sound, look or feel as inexpensive as it is. I am quite amazed that we were able to get both this guitar and mandolin together for under a hundred bucks. While the saying that ""You get what you pay for"" is true more times than not, in this case, we got way more than what we paid for and couldn't be happier with this purchase.

"The fragrance of this lotion smells more (to me) like the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Body Wash than anything close to cucumber-scented. I was surprised at how I didn't smell even a hint of cucumber, just a very strong (almost too heavy) fragrance of something not cucumber. I've used a variety of different cucumber lotions and washes, and this is the first one I've encountered that doesn't even come close to smelling cucumber-y. The scent of this lotion does not wear away easily, which will make those who do like it happy and then those like me, not so much.However, that being said, I do like the way it is immediately absorbed without leaving any greasy film whatsoever and does make my skin feel softer and lightly moisturized.Five stars for the lotion itself, but only two stars for the fragrance. To be fair, I gave it three stars because Olay really has made a good quality and affordable body lotion, but the scent is really strong and lacking anything resembling cucumber, to my nose (and my family members' noses, too).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27G4IY4JMVSXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006L1ZP6Q#wasThisHelpful","R27G4IY4JMVSXU","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This electronic dictionary and thesaurus is compact, making it nicely portable, but I feel it is rather dated, like something that would have been manufactured about a decade ago. The dictionary words are rather limited, and the user interface for other options can be rather confusing and not very intuitve. Having owned an electronic Franklin dictionary/thesaurus product some 20 years ago, it was superior in every way to this although not as compact. Sadly, that product is no longer made, and I feel pretty let down by this particular model. Family members enjoy using it occasionally, so at least it's getting some use.

"This is one of my favorite small kitchen tools, it's great for not only slicing pizza with ease of course, but I also use it for easily cutting sandwiches as well as quickly slicing through very large batches for dumplings. The palm rest makes it very easy to hold onto and apply as little or as much pressure as needed. Clean-up is ridiculously simple by pulling off the cutting wheel and washing it and the housing--both of which wash and rinse very well. Then, after drying, I snap the wheel back into place and it's ready to go again. The wheel, although it is some sort of plastic, is still quite sharp and tempered in some way so as to not bend or warp under pressure. It rolls smoothly within the housing while the palm rest is sturdy and secure in my hand allowing me to easily slice through thick or thin crust pizzas, sandwiches without tearing, and (dumpling) dough safely, cleanly and effectively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3X86CVY9FIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NYH7XI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3X86CVY9FIJ","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked up a few packs of these Knorr Roasters Roasting Bag and Seasoning Blend for Chicken, (Buffalo flavor) packs at my local grocery store to try something quick and different than my usual chicken recipes.PACKAGE: The compactly folded roasting bag comes packed in a little area sealed separately in the top of the package, while the seasoning blend is at the bottom.NUTRITION FACTS: (At 1 1/3 Tbsp serving size): 25 calories, 450mg of sodium, 5g carbohydrates, 0g fat, 0g protein. Package also states that this is made in a facility that processes milk, egg, soy, wheat and anchovies.PREPARATION: Put 1 1/4 lbs. of chicken breasts into roasting bag, add seasoning, seal with provided tie, turn bag over several times until pieces are evenly coated, place flat in baking dish, bake in 350 degree preheated oven for 35 minutes. Let bag sit for 5 minutes, open and serve. (Serves 5)APPEARANCE: The chicken didn't have the rich orange-red appearance as on the packaging, it was watery and paler orange in color.FLAVOR: I felt that the seasoning could have had more of a ""kick"" to it. There was a very, very mild buffalo flavor making it taste kind of plain, and we found that the chicken still needed additional seasonings and sauce after tasting the chicken to give it a more noticeable, well-balanced flavor.TEXTURE: The chicken breasts were very moist, but the texture was somewhat chewy-tough.CLEAN-UP: The roasting bag truly does make clean-up very easy.CONCLUSION: I would add additional seasonings of my own to the chicken prior to roasting when I use up my remaining packs of this. It's not a bad flavor, just not enough, making it taste kind of plain and boring. I'll use up what I have already purchased, but won't get anymore of this particular flavor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVNEWTY3X467/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CT9PVO#wasThisHelpful","RCVNEWTY3X467","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our daughter said she saw this, immediately thought of me and got me a copy, which I'm thoroughly enjoying. ""This Is Not a Book"" is an experiential exploration into random, sometimes thoughtful, other times downright silly (but always imaginative and fun) activities. Some of techniques involved in the ""missions"" include drawing, doodling, writing, cut and paste, or just daring you to do something quirky.The free-style writing, art/doodles and photography in this (not a book) say, ""No pressure"" and encourages you to just go with it, imagine/daydream, take creative or outside-the-box style chances, (thankfully none of which involve the endangerment of any animals or possible legal repercussions). Certain pages within this work, however, will be mutilated or otherwised damaged if all of the assignments are completed.There is a lot of fun to be had with this publication, if you are willing to ""lighten up"" for just a little while and be playful.

"I bought this for our oldest daughter, who has been using this nearly every day, and her thick, long, healthy hair really has held a very nice curl where it wouldn't before using regular clamp-style curling irons and hot rollers. A marcel-style iron does hold a curl in her often stubbornly straight hair pretty well, but she was not comfortable using those, so this has been a great alternative/addition to her hair styling collection.The learning curve takes some practice, but after a few tries, she achieved beautiful, consistent results, curling her hair section by section. The included heat glove is an essential component to using this wand, in my opinion, and the cool tip helps aid in maneuvering the wand through the hair safely. The glove itself (and hand) will get hot if it is in contact with the wand for more than a very few seconds, but with proper use of the wand and glove, prolonged contact between the two is not necessary.The tapered wand gets quite hot (heat adjustable from 270 degrees to 410 degrees) quickly and evenly with a wonderfully sleek surface that makes her curls look smooth and finished. The tapered end feature lends a ""naturally curly"" look to her normally straight hair, and what she and I love most about this is how very long her curls last--ALL DAY! Normally, within an hour or two, her curls from regular irons/hot rollers would droop and disappear, but not with this curling wand.Finally, the digital controls are easy to read/use and well-placed. The temperature lock feature is wonderful, which keeps one from accidentally turning it down or up during use. I have been extremely impressed with this curling wand/glove set, and will probably end up getting one of my own so I won't have to borrow my daughter's. I highly recommend this product, it's been the answer to helping our daughter put beautiful curls in her straight hair that LAST ALL DAY LONG!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Q6XX8EY4S8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V265QW#wasThisHelpful","R37Q6XX8EY4S8S","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for our children for general doodling and shading in minor projects, and for those purposes these are fine. However, these are not particularly suitable for serious art, such as fine art competitions or major projects. The variety of colors is good, but the depth of color is very light and not heavily pigmented or rich-looking. But, for general, everyday use with a wide spectrum of colors, these are okay. This would be a nice starter set for someone to practice their coloring in/shading techniques before moving on to a higher quality but more expensive set of colored pencils.

"This is a very basic set of 6 clay tools, which are actually like 12 tools due to each piece having 2 different modeling/sculpting ends. I like that each tool is numbered, (#10, #13, #19, #24, #36 and #37), as I couldn't tell in the product photo, although some of the numbers are difficult to read. Each of these hardwood tools were nicely smooth, with the exception of the #37, (with the rounded blunt end). This one was slightly unfinished and raw-feeling, but thankfully not splintery. Although I've seen the flat #10 combing tool in various sets with teeth even and uneven, and in this set, the teeth are not perfectly even.

"I purchased two of these ecoTOOLS Make-Up Kabuki Brush Sets (one for our daughter, one for myself) after comparing several different brands and reviews, and I'm so glad I did. To begin with, this entire set of a concealing, bronzing, contouring and buffing brushes cost less than what I normally pay at a brick and mortar store for one Kabuki buff brush alone, and the quality of these brushes is as good, if not better.The bristles are soft and each of the bristle's end tips are finely tapered, which results in a more natural, softer application with regular pressure, but probably not suitable for theatrical makeup application/stage makeup or where much heavier application is desired. The brushes hold their shape well, and feel so nice against the skin with no prickly bristles. To give a good test to the bristles, I have tugged and pulled from the middle and outside of the bristles (which is my way to predict if they are prone to shedding) and have not had one single bristle come out, so I am very pleased.As a former makeup artist, I have used several different brands and types of brushes, and these are surprisingly good quality for the price, (but only for personal use because of the short handles, which would make it very awkward when doing another person's makeup). I like that the handles of these are short, because they are perfect for travel, stow away nicely, and the shorter length doesn't adversely affect my personal makeup application at all. These brushes are so very butter-soft are a pleasure to use.I highly recommend these brushes for anyone looking for a nice quality brush set at a very budget-friendly price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A78ODQP1WXY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TKZS76#wasThisHelpful","R3A78ODQP1WXY8","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Using the entire bag, I was able to make 48 chocolate-coated/dipped (overstuffed) peanut butter-filled Ritz crackers, a family favorite in my home and among our friends. This melts very well in a microwaveable-safe bowl, and I always stir in just a bit of vegetable oil after melting the chocolate down to give our treats a nice gloss.

"I bought this at our local hardware store to use for quick, around-the-house jobs, and it has to be one of my favorite tools/gadgets. I like this very much for a few reasons. First, it's a two-in-one tool, so it saves space and time. Second, this is very well-made and function as well as the day I bought it (at least 4 years ago). Third, the rubbery grip makes it very easy to keep a good (and comfortable) grip on. But, the list goes on:The long-nosed plier side is long enough to get the job done when my household repairs have called for one. Additionally, the wire stripping portion has come in handy the couple of times or so that I've needed to use it, so that's always a plus and kind of makes this 3 tools in one.The flat nose jaws on this open about an inch or so wide, so has been useful for most all of the projects that I have had to work on. The teeth/ridges on both of the pliers have helped me to keep a good grip on whatever I'm working on and have never worn down.There is a small metal button on one side that you can slide up or down to unlock these and switch from one plier to the next, and stays put quite well. Transitioning from one plier side to the other couldn't be smoother or easier. I absolutely recommend this Allied 30578 SwtichGrip Dual Action Plier Tool to anyone who does occasional, small household repairs/projects to those who use tools daily in their line of work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWCOY8QIBN5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IWZWG#wasThisHelpful","RWWCOY8QIBN5O","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I began taking probiotics several years ago after my local herbal/natural medicine store owner and friend recommended I incorporate them into my diet. The ones I started buying and using were great, but didn't fit well into my budget.

The odor is awful and nearly caused me to not take them at all in the beginning. But, I'm glad I did because I have very little bloat since incorporating them into my diet, even after eating raw veggies. I used to get terrible pain from trapped gas, but I have found that the probiotics I took before as well as these (much less expensive but equally effective) Spring Valley Multi-Enzyme Probiotics has greatly reduced this very uncomfortable symptom.Although the suggested use/directions on the bottle says to take 3 tablets before or after each meal, I generally have had good success with 3 pills nightly after my evening meal.

"I typically try to keep ginger root capsules in my medicinal supplies at all times because it is a natural and pretty effective way to help with a few things. First, when someone in my family starts having that sick tummy/nauseous feeling, this is often easier to tolerate than sipping ginger tea (which I prefer) to help with the nausea.Second, if I feel at all like vertigo or a dizzy spell is trying to creep up on me, I like knowing I have these pills on hand to assist with the nausea that can come with it. Additionally, this can help improve certain digestive issues as well as assisting in keeping one's cholesterol in check (in conjunction with a heart-healthy diet and exercise). These capsules are sort of large, but we haven't had any problems with that and am pleased with this purchase.HYPERTHYROID SUFFERERS: It may be of interest for hyperthyroidism sufferers to note that ginger is ""hot"" so if one is dealing with an active ""hot"" condition such as hyperthyroidism (high/too fast thyroid issues), mint -(which is considered ""cold"")- may be a better option for aiding in treating nausea and other associated symptoms that can accompany those with hyperthyroid issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CFXYV7NSJ3GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014EECK#wasThisHelpful","R2CFXYV7NSJ3GQ","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to see if it would be able to remove the (small but noticeable to me) spots/stains on our older, white gas stovetop, but this product didn't do much of anything for it. My Mr. Clean Magic Erasers did a much better job at getting most of the staining, so I'm going to roll up my sleeves and show those few remaining spots no mercy...This Astonish cleaner is a finely gritted white paste and I can see how this would be suitable and effective for many things, but just wasn't (effective) for my primary purpose of the stove top. It does appear just a little of this will go a long way, which makes it a cost-effective product. I did test a small area on some (vintage) mustard-colored cookware, but quickly stopped as it appeared to be causing some surface damage (slightly removing the finish). I'm sure that I will find some other use for it at some point, such as stainless steel, oven interior, vehicle wheels/rims, etc. or something that can handle the grit texture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDQ59KG0Z2AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFRIZ#wasThisHelpful","R1MDQ59KG0Z2AX","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This plush version of Rainbow Dash is complete with her ""cutie mark"" and is really sweet, soft and a fun change from the little plastic figure collection of MLP figures that our daughters have acquired.

"I bought this Manuka Honey primarily for aiding in wound healing, and have found it to work quite well. In addition, I have found it to be useful as a preventative aid in helping to keep me (about 1 TBSP a day until I feel the threat has passed) from getting sick when I've spent time around others who are sick (cold/flu). The taste is not bad, it is slightly grainy with a different, but not unpleasant (to me) flavor.As an aid in wound healing, I use a Q-Tip to get out what I need, then immediately close the jar. When used in this way, the product lasts a very long time. However, when I take it by the tablespoonfuls, obviously it will not last very long. Although this is expensive, I feel the cost justifies the benefits for both external and internal use, and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9D1B1AA4EQRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O0BL9E#wasThisHelpful","R9D1B1AA4EQRJ","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY OF MY LONGER REVIEW BELOW:Pro's:*most tasted fresh**salt amount was just right**Planter's Customer Service is good*Con's:*mostly peanuts and almonds, with a few token variety nuts**had some gnarly-tasting nuts in one can, had to dispose of**generic-brand mix and brand-name prices*LONGER, EXPANDED VERSION IF YOU WISH TO READ:Having not bought these for a long while, we picked up a couple of cans of these at our local warehouse club thinking they would be as good of a mix as they used to be, but they weren't. There is hardly more in this mix than peanuts and almonds, both of which I like from time to time, but I was hankering for more of a variety mix. There were a few of the cashews, brazil nuts, hazelnuts and even less pecans, which are currently my favorite. There were a few nuts in one of the cans that tasted gnarly and had to be disposed of. I have never knowingly had a rotten nut, so I don't know if some were, but it was unpleasant at best.The amount of sea salt on the nuts was just right in both cans, so that was good. Several years ago, I did buy a can of Planters Mixed Nuts that was so salty no one could eat them, even after trying to shake the salt out. I knew we must have gotten a bad batch, called the Planters telephone number on the can and spoke with a rep about it. She was very nice, apologized and sent out a coupon/certificate for another can, which was fine (both in salt and mix). However, I believe that the amount/variety of nuts included in both cans we recently bought was very limited, except for peanuts and almonds. Frankly, I feel like I paid brand-named pricing for store brand/generic mix/quality -(and generic is what I'll be buying next time so I wil actually get what I paid for).In closing, the reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is because like many food items, product size/quality/variety is shrinking while the prices are not, so it doesn't come as a huge suprise that Planters is among them (with the amount/variety) and probably (and sadly) to be expected in this economy. Second, the one time I did call (about the excess salt issue), Planters customer service was prompt to make it right, and I believe they would have done the same again if I had chose to call, I just didn't. I just don't plan on buying this anymore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R248HYTNVS5GLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EPQVIU#wasThisHelpful","R248HYTNVS5GLV","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think the Olay Professsional Pro-X Cleansing System and a pack of these replacement heads make a great gift (for male or female) at any age who a wants cleaner, clearer face!Another great thing about these is that one can take a permanent marker and color-code (or initial) the top of the replacement heads if multiple members of the family want to use the handheld cleanser without needing to buy multiple units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTM0HTEZ6RYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043OWJG2#wasThisHelpful","R2LTM0HTEZ6RYI","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for one of our daughters (middle school aged) who is quite petite, and I thought this delicate-looking necklace would look very pretty on her.While it is quite dainty and feminine, there are a couple of things I think could be better. First, the wings could be a bit more defined. Given the very small pendant size, they just need a tad bit more definition. Second, the small necklace chain itself is so very lightweight -(it's the kind that tangles easily)- that I feel the need to replace it at some point soon.Other than those two things, I like it.

"I bought 3 sets of these necklace sets for our 3 daughters (middle to high school aged) for Christmas gifts, I thought they looked really pretty online, and have always been quite pleased with every Amazon Curated Collection item I've purchased. However, these are just way too chunky and blingy for adding a subtle/simple touch to their wardrobes.*The finish on these necklaces is shiny with no tarnishing or discolorations.*The simulated (large-ish) pearl necklace has a nice tone and weight, but is suitable (in my opinion) for wearing with thicker sweater tops, not lightweight clothing.*The wheat chain looks way too thick/chunky and not delicate or feminine at all, just awkward-looking.*The (textured) links in the link chain are also much bigger than what I think consitutes ""pretty""--but upon looking at it further, I realized that with a few charms added to the links here and there, it could make a cute charm necklace. With a bit of work, I could probably make them into charm bracelets...In all fairness, I did get these sets at a great price, and although these chains aren't as versatile as I had hoped they'd be, the pearl necklace is wearable with heavier knits and the link chain has possibilities. But, I'm stil trying to decide what to do about the wheat chains.

"The only brand of marcel curling iron I've ever used has been Gold 'N Hot, but when I needed to replace my old iron of many years, Gold 'N Hot was out of stock. Since I wanted an iron that day, I took a chance on this Helen of Troy model. I use this moderately (not every day) and have had it for at least 2 years with no problems. The barrel spins pretty well (I've noticed a very slight barrel drag at times, thus taking one star off of my rating) with the option to lock the barrel, but I prefer using it unlocked. The cord swivels freely with no troubles. The temperature control is great when I'm working with our daughters' different hair types, allowing me to adjust with higher or lower temps. However, I find that I still prefer the style of the Gold 'N Hot barrel, it fits in my hand better and spins very well with no drag ever.I love the fast, ridge-less, smooth curls that are easily achieved with marcel irons in general, and this is has been a viable alternative to my regular brand. I recommend this for home use since I have not used this brand in a salon setting, I can't say one way or another if this would hold up to that constant kind of use and hot storage in between clients. However, this has been a good (and quick-heating) iron with consistent, steady, even heat distribution. The finish has stayed true and I've never had any problems with residue on the curling rod.As an aside, if this is your first time using a marcel-syle iron, I recommend you do some practice runs with the heat off and the barrel unlocked until you get the feel of it, as well as getting used to having no cool tip on the end of the rod. Additionally, experiment with the lower temperature settings before going into the higher settings, finding the right temp for your hair type, as the higher temperatures have the ability to literally fry/burn your hair off. It is important to learn to work quickly and smoothly with this type of curling iron for less damage and smoother, truer curls. After you get the hang of it, you will no longer want to use a standard clip iron!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRQP1E9RF0QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIWGO0#wasThisHelpful","RTRQP1E9RF0QX","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these to keep various sketchbooks, cardstocks, and packages of photo papers stored neatly on a bookshelf. These have been very handy in helping keep these items at hand and organized. Anything that helps me stay organized is a winner in my book! These are made of flimsy plastic, but I knew that when purchasing them, and for my use, these are exactly what I needed.I wouldn't even try to store them (with magazines and other flimsy items) on my desk on their own, because they would most certainly bend and fall down. But, when these are fairly snug beside each other on my bookshelf, along with other books to the end of the shelf, they work fine.I like the happy colors and the little metal ID plate in front of each one to label the contents. The metal studs help to prevent the organizers from falling apart. I found these very easy to assemble in very little time. I would liken the thickness of the plastic material to that of a cereal box's cardboard thickness.These plastic magazine organizers are just right for my uses, fit well on my (almost 10"" deep shelf), and would like to purchase an additional set later on for placement on another shelf. Be aware, however, that these are not going to stand up well as in the item's product description photo; I tested these on my desk for this review to be sure, and they bend and do not want to stay up on their own, and when I was able to balance them, the slightest bump made it fall over.

"I have never given very much thought to our surge protector strips until one (different brand) had a dead outlet, which had me in a panic because I thought the device (whose cord) occupied that outlet was dead, until I decided to plug my device in another outlet, and the device was fine. It was at that time that I gave much more thought into my next surge protector strip purchase.After narrowing down the search results on Amazon by rating and price, I found this to be fairly inexpensive, had plenty of outlets (6) on the strip, a green indicator light to let me know it's protected, a 4 foot cord, and that this strip helps filter out ""line noise""--something that didn't cross my mind before. Also, knowing they offer a lifetime guarantee was icing on the cake, so I bought it, have had it several weeks, and have been very pleased with no problems.This has 2 keyhole slots in the back of it for mounting, although we sit our's flat. I may end up replacing all of our older surge protectors with the Tripp Lite brand, as these seem to have more features/benefits than our older (different-branded) ones, lifetime-guaranteed, and are budget-friendly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZVK3ZNNDTJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006L4F1#wasThisHelpful","R26ZVK3ZNNDTJ3","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for one of our daughters who primarily is interested in becoming a graphic artist, but I thought this sketching set would help her to expand her talent beyond the graphics tablet she uses. I knew this Royal & Langnickel Deluxe Sketching Artist Box Set was suitable mainly for budding artists, but I really thought that the quality of the materials inside the case would be better.It's true that the case the supplies are stored in is nothing special, and I expected as much. It's also true that the design of how the inset plastic tray (that the sketch supplies are in) will fall out when you try to close it. Again, not a big deal. However, the minature mannequin is so poorly made, the arms are quite stiff and not fully poseable, the connecting wire in it is so tight rendering it pretty much useless.  Additionally, unless it is posed in a very specific, awkward manner, it will fall.The 12 graphite pencils themselves are really bad quality, and I would not suggest this set for a new artist, because using these pathetic pencils will only be discouraging to use. The several other materials provided are just okay, but not horrible, and I do plan on getting our daughter a nice set of (higher quality) sketching pencils to replace the 12 graphite pencils provided in the set, as well as a better (functional) mannequinn.I struggled between giving this product 2 or 3 stars, but gave it 3 stars, because despite the mannequin and 12 graphite pencils, the rest of the items are (just) okay and useable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCKHCC10LIFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KY888Q#wasThisHelpful","R1TCKHCC10LIFB","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The tabs for each section make for easy and quick referencing, which is very nice for our needs. There are several of the basic recipes that make this a great cookbook for beginners, as well as some more advanced recipes.I have some other cookbooks that were not damaged, but this book is the one cookbook that I find our daughters referring to the most, from which they have found recipes to make our family some lovely meals and desserts. As a mother, there is something special about seeing our daughters sitting at the kitchen counter planning a meal or dessert from that familiar red and white plaid BHG brand that I used to plan many meals and treats from when I was younger as well.I have found this book to be of sturdy construction and very easy to use.

"One of my friends recently rescued an injured kitty and has been treating his wounded paw and ear, while giving him lots of tender, loving care. However, whenever she would have to clean and apply medicine to his hurt places, he would get stressed out for hours and not want to eat (and he was already skinny to begin with). She was certain that the stress the cat was experiencing was also impeding his healing.I wanted to help in some way, and I searched Amazon to find something, anything, that would help this little guy feel better and calmer. I found Pet Naturals Calming for Cats and had it sent to her. A few days later, she told me that these herbal softchews are amazingly effective, and that it has made such a huge difference in him during his wound-cleaning times and just in general. His healing process is progressing well now, and not only the kitty, but also my friend, are doing so much better now.If you, or someone you know, has a kitty experiencing abnormal stress or irritability, I highly recommend giving this product a try--I'm glad (we) did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMNESXNTGHKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011DHJ2W#wasThisHelpful","R1XMNESXNTGHKC","A29N66WIWNN8JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29N66WIWNN8JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Setting that aside, this is a beautiful watch that would suit most women's wrists very well.It comes in the typical yellow Invicta watch box, which is fine.

It is HEAVY - definitely a two person job to carry it inside and place it where you want it to be.It's heavy because it's made from MDF (particleboard). Not my favorite stuff in the world, but it's cheap and used in lots of cheaper furniture.All the parts come labeled, and there's a pictogram for assembly directions. The directions aren't extremely detailed, and it definitely took me some time to figure out how this went together. You assemble it from top down, which was odd. I had to lay it on its side to get some of the pieces together, but it all came together nicely.My two cats seem to like it enough, though neither one has spent a significant amount of time in it. There's plenty of room for cats to use their claws, which is a nice feature.  Finally, this is less than 1/2 the price you'd pay in a pet store for a cat tree.

These cables, however, fell way short of expectations.Overall, I've ordered 6 Mediabridge micro-USB cables of various sizes. The quality seems good at first, and the cables work for a while. But after a couple months, all the connectors have become loose and fall out of our phones. Both my wife and I have used a total of 4 different phones, and it's most certainly the cables that fall out. It's super frustrating to wake up in the morning and realize your phone didn't charge overnight.I recommend you avoid these cables, unless they change the way they make them.

"I've always wanted a food dehydrator, but could never really justify the cost. I was eager to try this one, mainly due to the higher quality parts (stainless steel) and almost no plastic.It comes in a large box, and is about the size of two countertop microwaves. It's pretty quiet to operate and doesn't take up enormous amounts of counter space. That being said, this isn't something I leave out all the time because of its size.Thus far I've dried a lot of fruit, and it's just as good as the stuff you buy in stores for a lot more money. We are very organic and our daughter loves dried fruit, so this has been a blessing. It takes a while to dry the fruit but you can do so much at once that it hasn't been a problem for us.The filter behind the machine is washable in case it gets gunked up. We had to figure out how to work the machine on our own, because as others have said, the manual is just terrible. Few details, but lots of specs on the unit in case you want to know how many watts it puts out.Overall, my family loves this dehydrator. I feel that it's overpriced, but then again, I haven't owned other dehydrators. We love the results and this is quickly becoming an indispensable appliance for our family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHQ076MFZSNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZG07SU#wasThisHelpful","R1KHQ076MFZSNE","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a number of paper shredders, and use this one in my veterinary clinic. This is the first Sentinel shredder I've tried, as I typically use Fellowes. Overall, I'm pretty impressed.It came packaged well in a very large box (it shipped in the original box, FYI). Instructions are minimal - just plug it in, turn it on, and off you go. The first time I tried it, it paused for a second before advancing the paper. The paper shreds at a pretty slow pace - slower than the Fellowes I use. The shreds are longer than I'm used to with Fellowes, as those shred into confetti. This is supposed to be security level 4, so I suppose it's safe enough for office use.It's moderately loud - something you definitely don't want running when you are answering phones. It's on wheels, which makes it easy to hide under a desk and pull out when needed. It does shred quite a lot of documents at once, and thus far, it hasn't jammed.The paper bin pulls out the front, while the unit stays stationary. The shredding head is attached, so you cannot use this over a larger bin. I find that the bin fills up about once a week with moderate use, which isn't too bad.Overall, this is a good shredder, not great. I'm spoiled with some higher end Fellowes shredders, but for the price, this is a pretty good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23A0RG6JYECW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNP06Y2#wasThisHelpful","R23A0RG6JYECW3","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like another reviewer here, I too compared this Epson 1040 to my BenQ W1070 DLP projector. I was quite surprised by the results, given the BenQ is 3 years older than this Epson.The Epson is small with a nice footprint. The remote is larger than expected, with buttons for advancing PowerPoint slides. This is a nice feature to have when using this as a business projector, but an odd inclusion for a projector billed as ""home cinema"".The fan, in a word, is LOUD. I thought my BenQ fan was loud until I turned this one on. It simply is far too loud to have it mounted over your head - you will definitely want this mounted far back in the room. That's actually what I had to do anyway, because this has such a longer throw distance than my BenQ. Mounted 12' away, I can get a 120"" screen with the BenQ, and only a 100"" screen with this 1040.The picture was just ""OK"". I'm spoiled by the BenQ, even though it's a ""budget"" PJ. This Epson uses different technology (LCD), which suffers from washed out colors and very poor black levels. No matter how I played with the settings, I could not get blacks to look black. They consistently looked dark gray, which is annoying to say the least. The colors also didn't ""pop"" as much as the BenQ, which was disappointing.I will say this is the brightest PJ I've ever owned. It's definitely brighter than the BenQ, but in a dedicated home theater where light can be controlled, it just isn't necessary. In fact, I ended up moving this PJ into my living room that has a lot of windows due to its brightness. I talked my wife into letting me get a screen that rolls down, so that when we aren't watching TV, you'd never know anything was there. The only issue I had is that the 1040 doesn't have vertical lens shift, so you have to have it as far down so that it's in the center of your image.The 1040 works very well in bright rooms, which is very different than your typical projector. Don't expect a movie theater quality picture, but it works good enough given the right situation. As a dedicated home theater projector, the BenQ is far superior in image quality and placement flexibility.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQWSNLD1NSON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D7XGNS#wasThisHelpful","R1BQWSNLD1NSON","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love boxing for exercise, and am always on the lookout for new equipment. I have a cheap Everlast vinyl 100# bag that I've had for years, and it's hasn't held up super well. Like most heavy bags, the weight has shifted all to the bottom and it's now like punching granite.This Ringside bag is completely different. The weight is spread out over the entire bag, so that it doesn't settle in the bottom. You get an even feel no matter where you hit the bag, as long as it's below the Ringside label.The bag is leather and has great stitching holding it together. You can just feel that this is a higher quality bag, especially when compared to the cheap Everlast bags.It comes with very heavy duty chains, but you still need something to hang it from the ceiling. I use the Everlast wood beam heavy bag hanger, and it works perfectly.The bag is only 70#, per the label. It does move more than I'd like, as I'm 205 pounds and hit the bag hard. If this bag was at least 100#, it would've been absolutely perfect. However, it does move less than I thought it would, but keep in mind you can't really wallop it.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with the quality of craftsmanship of this bag. My Everlast bag cost about $100, but is way cheaper quality than this bag. I wholeheartedly recommend this Ringside over the Everlast, for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRY0U16OB57WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K410MW#wasThisHelpful","RRY0U16OB57WC","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a lot of animals and have owned countless vacuums over the years. This is the first canister vacuum I've tried, and I am pleased with the results.It comes in a moderately sized box, but was not as heavy as I would've thought. It maneuvers very easily, and I haven't been able to tip it over yet. The head is smaller than I would've liked, but I'm sure they did that so that it maneuvers easily. It literally turns on a dime and really hugs the corners where debris sits. It slides easily into crevices, like the area between the fridge and the counter. That part really was impressive, as it picked up a whole bunch of stuff that been trapped there for years!The brush roller is very soft and picks up dust on hardwood floors very well. The hose is long and so is the cord, so I never have to move the plug halfway through a room. The wand extends for reaching higher places, such as the dusty areas on top of curtains.This vacuum works very well on hardwood floors and rugs, but clearly struggles on carpet. I have very thick, newer carpet, and this just couldn't produce nearly the results as upright vacuums I own. The head is small and the brush speed is too slow to keep up with a thick pile. It's clearly designed for rugs and hard floors.Overall, I love this vacuum and will certainly keep it in my rotation. There are better, upright vacuums (even cordless ones) that produce better results on carpets. However, this works very well on hard floors and low pile rugs. It's very light, maneuverable, and it easy to use. Oh, and it's super quiet!  Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPJFMTD2QREM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFUVNKS#wasThisHelpful","R3GPJFMTD2QREM","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a lot of animals, as both my wife and myself are in the veterinary field. I have used countless vacuums over the years, and have fallen in love with cordless vacuums. I've been happily using the Hoover Air Cordless over the past year, and wanted to try out this Bissell to see if it produced better results.It's very small, lightweight and highly maneuverable. The head turns on a dime, making it able to hug corners easily. It did jackknife itself a few times because the head was turned so tightly I couldn't push it forward, but that wasn't too big an issue. It's so light that you really can pick it up and put it wherever you want.The Li-Ion battery took about 4 hours to charge, and lasts just about 45 minutes. There are two speeds, normal and high. To my ears, they sound more like super low speed and medium-low speeds, but it performed better than it sounded. I was actually impressed with how quiet it was, and was surprised at the results.We have a mixture of thick carpet, hardwood and tile floors. I have been faithfully using the Hoover Air Cordless 3.0 over the past year, which produces fantastic results. This Bissell did superbly on hardwood and tile floors, but did not perform as well on carpet as the Hoover. The Hoover is a bit bigger and clearly has more suction power, so it wasn't surprising it performed better on carpet.However, the Hoover didn't produce as good results on hard floors. This Bissell is so light and maneuverable, and with the brush roller, got up all the dust and debris on our hardwood floors. It struggled with my thick carpet, at times getting stuck and making it tough to push.It's a cinch to empty - just remove the canister and push a button. The attachment is mediocre, with a bit too much wobble for my liking. It's a small crevice tool with a brush head that slides out, but the suction just wasn't great for use on a microfiber couch covered in dog hair. The hair got caught up in the brush but never quite got suctioned in through the hose.In summary, this is a very good vacuum for hard floors, and is nice for light duty carpet work. It's not super heavy duty and does not have the best suction when compared to other cordless vacuums. The Hoover Air Cordless is much better on carpet, but this Bissell is better on hard floors and rugs.  It just depends on what your needs are. That being said, it's very quiet, light, and extremely convenient. Once you go cordless, you'll never go back to regular vacuums!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNSGJBTHPV6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S2118C#wasThisHelpful","R1CNSGJBTHPV6T","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a veterinarian, I've always had pets and have used countless carpet shampooers over the years. Two of our dogs currently have health conditions, so we've had tons of urinary accidents over the past year in our basement. I have tried 3 different carpet shampooers over this last year, including a Rug Doctor Pet commercial carpet shampooer ($400), and this Bissell cleans better than all of them.It's super easy to put together. Simply slide the handle in, use the one provided screw to attach it (taped to the orange handle), and you're good to go. It comes with small samples of anti-bacterial deep cleaning solution, and a professional deep cleaning solution. Just fill the tank to the line with hot water, screw in the anti-bacterial solution, and fill to the next line. There's a switch where you can do a deep clean or a quick clean, so make sure you choose deep. Quick cleans are meant for very mild debris and dry in one hour.After turning it on, I immediately appreciated that this is about half as loud as every other carpet shampooer I've ever used. Hold down the switch while going forwards and backwards, then release and allow it to suction the water going forwards and backwards. The brush definitely digs up the hair, despite me vacuuming prior to using. It leaves wet clumps of hair in a variety of places, but I've actually found this to be consistent with higher end machines I've used. Once the carpets dry (a few hours), just vacuum them up and you're done.I'm not sure how much is the shampooer vs. the anti-bacterial solution, but I definitely got better results with this machine than my commercial Rug Doctor. The urine stains are gone, and so is the smell! It's also half the size, half as loud, and is much more convenient. The tank is smaller, but I got through about a 20'x15' room on one tank. It's super easy to fill, so it wasn't an inconvenience for me.It has an attachment for upholstery that easily attaches to the front of the machine. I used it on my couch (vomit stains), and it took them right out. It dried quicker than the carpet, which is always a nice thing.I'm really impressed with this machine. I can't tell you how many machines I've used over the past 10 years, but this is definitely my favorite. It's light, maneuverable, quiet, and produced fantastic results. I love how you can easily put the cleaner in the tank, and the waste tank is emptied by just opening a rubber seal.  I am not at all affiliated with Bissell and have no agenda, and I highly recommend this shampooer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33809OY4FP4LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R33809OY4FP4LF","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used numerous Otterbox cases over the years and have always been pleased. This was one of the first cases available for the S6 Edge+, and was recommended by a Verizon employee.  I thought I'd give this a shot along with the Spigen ultra thin case. After two days of using this case, I returned it.It certainly provides adequate protection, as all Otterbox cases are known for. It adds a lot of bulk, however, and turns this one-handed phone into a definite two-handed affair. The way it wraps around the edges really detracts from the beauty of the ""edge"" screen, almost making me question why I bothered putting it on.Once it's on, it makes the buttons nearly impossible to press (on/off, volume). I literally have to dig my finger in to wake my phone up, which made me use my phone less. It was a huge pain, and I'm surprised more people aren't bothered by this.It's very slick, and actually made me drop my phone more than without a case at all. Due to the bulk, you definitely need to be focused with two free hands to use it comfortably.My last issue is that this is about $25 too expensive. $50 for this case, when others are half that price, is just ridiculous.Overall, this is the first time I've been disappointed with Otterbox. I now use the Spigen ultra-thin case, and it's perfect.

"I have used about 12 different wireless printers over the past 5 years, all with mixed results. I find using wifi on printers to be one of the most infuriating things on this planet. I cannot fathom why it is so difficult to get a wifi printer to work EVERY time, rather than have to disconnect/reconnect, turn it off, hard reset, chant with prayer beads, etc. It's totally ridiculous.I jumped at the chance to review this Epson, even though I haven't liked any of the Epsons I've tried in the past.  I am extremely pleased with this printer.It was fairly easy to set up. I tried using the software, but of course connecting to wifi gave me an error (why?). So I manually used the touch screen on the printer, which went fine. It uses 0-9 numbers to enter passwords, which is really annoying and takes way longer than necessary.So far, I haven't had any <gasp> wireless connection issues. It prints every time, though it takes longer than other wifi printers I've used to send the document.It's got a small footprint, but it's deceiving. It opens a tray on the front when it prints a document, and you need room for that (about 6""). So while it fit in my cabinet, I can't keep the doors closed when I print or else it gives me an error. It's rather annoying, and kind of a ""gee wiz"", but not necessary, feature. You can then press a button on the touchscreen, and the tray disappears again. While neat, I fear this is just waiting for a mechanical failure.This comes with a feature that will print labels on CD/DVDs. There is a separate tray where you can put the CD/DVD, and it prints directly to it. While this would've been great to have 10 years ago, I feel it's an outdated feature in this day of digital music and video. I suppose photographers would like it, but can't really imagine using it myself.The paper tray is very tiny, and only holds maybe 30 sheets of paper. It's really not a ""small office"" printer, and more along the lines meant for home/personal use. However, the touchscreen is amazing. I've never really paid much attention to the small, cheap touchscreens on printers, but this is definitely the best I've used. It's big, responsive, and bright.The print quality is just superb for an all-in-one printer. Keep in mind that when printing through Google Cloud Print, the quality is not nearly as good. This is a known issue with Google Cloud Print, and may get fixed in the future. That being said, the quality is simply fantastic for pictures and documents.At the time of this writing (9/14/15), the only place that has ink refills is directly through Epson. They are expensive, as they all tend to be. Epson is one of the worst printer manufacturers for allowing generic refills, so I wouldn't be surprised if no generics become available. For my light printer use, this isn't too much of an issue. But for a heavy user or small office, it's definitely something to consider.Overall, this printer has been reliable and has provided superb quality. There are some quirks, as all printers have, but overall I've been happy. I will keep this review updated if any issues pop up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MUI20K3VMJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R30MUI20K3VMJ5","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our daughter loves Paw Patrol - it's one of the few shows she actually sits through. She also happens to love slides, so this was a no-brainer.One really nice thing about it is that it all gets packaged up in the center tower circle. We have endless amounts of toys strewn about her play room, so having a place to store these is great. The blocks are big and fit nicely together. Her small hands don't have any issue putting these together.The one design flaw is that the slide has to attach to the truck. So, she can't actually detach the truck and play with it without the slide collapsing, which is kind of a silly idea. It would've been nice if the slide was supported separately but dumped Marshall into the fire truck, then allowing the fire truck to pull away on its own.Besides that, she really does love playing with this.

"My wife and I have always been curious about these swings. They are pricey, but after using it, totally worth it if you have the money to spare.Spend a few moments watching the video that Amazon provides - it shows the movement perfectly. It sways back and forth, up and down like a natural mother moves. It doesn't swing like everything else, which is not natural. Our baby personally hated every swing we put her in, but she loves this one.The important thing is that this swing adjusts position easily, from practically laying down to sitting up. So if your baby is gassy, fussy, etc. you can easily change positions.It works off AC power, thankfully. It's heavy and big, so not really that portable. We just plugged it in our family room and leave it there, and have had no complaints.It has an app (for iPhone and Android) that allows you to control it via bluetooth. To be honest I thought this was a gimick, but my wife and I are surprised at how much we use it. We can slow/speed the swinging, change sounds, or stop it just from our phones. It's actually much more useful than either of us would've thought.The sounds are a little unrealistic/off. We find the waves most soothing, but you can provide your own music/white noise from your phone which is what we do most often. You can choose different motions, but they're all very similar. Our daughter cares little about the settings or the music, as most often we use this to help her nap.At first she was a bit fussy in the swing, but after a few times she really did take to it. She now falls asleep in it consistently, and the smooth motion keeps her sleeping for a good hour (thankfully!). It's a much smoother motion than a swing - no jerking issues have been encountered.Overall, we are very happy with this. It's a bit pricey and has some frivolous things, but the motion it provides is fantastic. It's the most realistic ""swing"" I've seen or used, and our baby really loves it. She's fussy, so that's really saying something!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSS86Z6MYBV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3ERYW#wasThisHelpful","R3PSS86Z6MYBV8","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife loves these earrings. I've always wanted to get her diamond earring studs, but have never been able to afford a decent enough sized pair. Enter these square studs, and now I have a very happy wife.These have a great contrast between the darker edges and the diamond centers. I'm not sure exactly how many carats there are, but the way they are cut they seem bigger and brighter than what you pay for. $50 would typically get you minuscule diamond studs, but here you get much bigger studs for the price.They're not the most sparkly studs in the world, but for the price they are quite nice. I don't know what the darker stones are around the edge - it's not listed anywhere. But it's a nice contrast.It comes in a very plain black box. There is no nice earring box - it's just a plain box with studs in it. The presentation was quite lacking, which made it feel like a ""cheap"" gift.They have secure clasps on the back, though they do loosen over time so make sure you check them. They're sterling silver, which allows for a cheaper price.

"I've owned a number of steam mops, including a Shark (leaked everywhere, drove me crazy!). This Bissell is by far my favorite steam mop.It's ergonomic and comfortable to use. It heats up in 30 seconds, which is fantastic when you need to use it quickly. I found with my other steam mops, I wouldn't use them as much because it took so much to get them going. With this Bissell, you just fill the detachable canister, let it heat up and you're good to go.The best part about this mop is that the floors are DRY when you're done! No more walking around on towels to clean up puddles, like I had to do with the Shark. It's also not as loud as the Shark, which is always a welcome benefit. The cord is super long, so you can get great coverage.I was nervous about using this on my hardwood floors, but it did just fine. Because it leaves no residual water, you don't have to worry about water ruining your wood (as long as the floor is sealed, which they all should be). You definitely can't use this on porous surfaces, such as cork or unfinished wood, but for 95% of people out there, that's not a concern.I love that it is so versatile. I've used it to steam clean my shower grout, my kitchen faucet, and door dams. It has a windows attachment which I've found produces great results. You can steam your wrinkled clothes, crevices, etc. It has so many functions, that this is worth way more than the price listed. I have an individual steam cleaner for faucets, etc. that cost $100. So for $50 more, you get a much more versatile tool.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZ3P2J121YSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LS47SA#wasThisHelpful","R1PZ3P2J121YSW","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She loves giving them their blankies and singing them songs. It's really cute watching her take care of these twins (what we call them, anyway).Word of note - like most children's toys, the packaging is like breaking into Fort Knox. It's absolutely ridiculous how hard it is to open these things. She was so excited to play with them, and then threw an absolute fit when it took me 10 minutes to unpackage them. There are twist ties, plastic attachments, tape, and more tape securing these dolls. I am at a loss for words as to why they are secured so tightly.Beyond the ridiculous packaging, the dolls are cute and my daughter enjoys playing with them. And that's all that matters!

"I used these sleeves to hide some cables to a monitor that was hung up on a wall, and they worked very well. You can hide a lot of cables in these sleeves, as they are made of neoprene which is stretchy and forgiving. The zipper is easy to engage and zips up easily.The only downside is the enormous, bright white ""Captive Cables"" written on the side.

"I have a number of Bosch laser levels, and this one so far is my favorite.It is typical Bosch quality - well made, light and durable. It comes with a nice case and a positioning device. It has a 1/4"" female screw on the bottom for attaching to a tripod (I use Bosch's tripod, but it also fits on my camera's tripod).What I love about this level is that it projects a 360 degree horizontal line. This is perfect for:hanging a dropped tile ceiling (what I used it for)hanging cabinetsaligning window rough insmake sure picture frames are all hung at the same heightcrown moldingwainscottingpainting half walls a different colorhanging chair railYou get the idea. It has a vertical line that also acts as a cross beam, or to make sure you are plumb.It easily locks the lines in place once level, and lets you know when you are no longer level.I highly recommend this laser level.

"I own a number of laser levels, and this is my favorite one. Bosch makes high quality products in my experience, and this feels like a premium device.It comes in a rather large box (with an L-BOXX container). The L-BOXX container is part of Bosch's cases that all stack/fit together snugly. This is great for people/contractors that own a number of Bosch tools so they can travel together well.The level itself is relatively small and light. It can attach to a tripod by itself, or to the 3 legged mounting base. The mounting base is very versatile, allowing you to pan/tilt this in any direction you want. I used it to attach to a door frame and it was perfectly snug.This is a 3 line laser - two vertical, one horizontal, and one down point to make sure you are plumb. It's the most useful, all-in-one laser level I've ever used.The level works like all others - keep pressing the button to get more lines, and press it again until everything turns off. It's extremely accurate in my testing, spanning a 30 foot room without any error that I could detect.I absolutely love this laser level. It comes at a premium price, but for contractors or the serious DIYer, it's a no-brainer - just get it and never have the need to get another one.One word of caution - I could not see the laser lines outdoors at all. This is best used indoors only - keep that in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF40G3KCDURWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7DRPHW#wasThisHelpful","RF40G3KCDURWV","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a handy device for those that don't have enough HDMI ports on their TVs or receivers. I use this with my soundbar, so everything connects to this device, outputs through the soundbar and into the TV.  It provides audio out for both HDMI and optical, so it will work with either/or.It has a remote, which is about the size of a long book of matches. It comes with a power cord, and will not work without it.It has ""automatic switching"", where it'll switch to the input that's currently active. However, in my testing I have found that it is not always reliable. At times I've had to manually switch to the input I'm watching.It's made of metal and has a nice heft to it.

"I own a number of laser levels, and all of them have a variety of uses. This two point laser level has only one use - to point a laser below and above it while level. This kind of tool can be used, for instance, when roughing in plumbing from floor to ceiling. It has a number of other uses in construction, but isn't quite the tool a weekend warrior would find most useful.I used this to hang a ceiling fan in our master bedroom. I wanted it centered, so I found the center of the floor and marked it. I took my Bosch tripod (BT150 for $35) and connected this laser level. I pointed the line below to match up with the center of the room, which then projected the center of the ceiling. I marked it and installed the fan so it was perfectly centered in our room. It turned out beautifully.This is magnetized, so it can hang on any kind of metal. You can use any kind of tripod, I just happened to like the Bosch tripod.The nice thing about this level is that it comes with a hardshell case. You don't realize how important this is until you crush one of your tools in your toolbag when a plumber's wrench falls on it.Overall, this is an excellent 2 point laser. However, make sure this is the kind of tool you need before purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19T3ZNGUMHKQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9DEAGI#wasThisHelpful","R19T3ZNGUMHKQZ","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second laser level, and I am more in love with this one compared to it's smaller sibling, the GLL 2-30! It comes very well packaged, all tucked nicely in a hardshell CASE! My one complaint about most of my tools is that the cheaper ones never include a case or a bag, but thankfully this has a case. You literally have no idea how essential it is until you destroy a tool that's just sitting in your tool bag (got crushed by my plumber's wrench).This is super easy to use. Turn it on and it beams a cross hair beam up to 50 feet. Hit the power button again, and it just shows a horizontal beam. Hit again, and only vertical. Hit again and it turns off.This laser is definitely not strong enough to use outdoors, so keep that in mind.Once it finds the level point, you can lock it by sliding the red switch. You can use it horizontally, vertically, or at any weird angle you want.  It connects to any tripod, but I use a Bosch tripod (the BT150 for $35).  It also comes with a BM3 positioning device ($27), which allows this thing to literally connect to anything.  You can stick it on a pole, a ladder, a wall, or anything that has an edge. It makes it extremely handy to use.You really don't know how much you need a laser level until you have one, then realize how much less hassle you would've had in past projects. I highly, highly recommend this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RC5ZWOPUPH5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6DTGP8#wasThisHelpful","R2RC5ZWOPUPH5C","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used a number of shredders over the years, and this is one of the better ones I've used. It has a small footprint, so it fits under a counter/desk very easily (about 18"" high). It can handle up to 8 sheets at a time, but definitely can jam with more than that. Lately I've been having issues with it jamming with only 4-5 sheets of paper, which is frustrating. There is a reverse switch, but it's manual so you have to be watching your shredding to make sure it's done correctly.It cross cut shreds for added security, and can shred credit cards which is a nice feature. It's louder than others I've tried, but most people expect that from a shredder. For the money, there definitely are quieter options.Make sure to keep the coils oiled occasionally, to decrease the amount of jams. Fellowes recommends applying a small amount of oil after each use.

This is a cute little speaker with a footprint about the size of a coffee cup.It collapses so that it's about 2"" thick, which is very convenient for travel. It opens up to add ""more bass"", but that really doesn't help all that much.It's easy to pair with your phone, and really does have a 12 hour battery life. My wife used it for the majority of a day working outside, and it didn't need to be charged.She's certainly no audiophile, but even she commented that the sound wasn't that good. It's thin, lacking in bass/mids, and tinny. It sounds similar to listening to music through your laptop speakers.

"I have a lot of experience with networking and absolutely hate it. It's enormously time consuming, frustrating, and unrewarding.

You plug it in, use the included stylus (or your finger) to navigate setup, and your'e done. I use this as a range extender, as our master bedroom is a dead zone for wifi.

It gets frequent updates, and the customer service has been outstanding.They called me after a week of using it, and I had a great conversation with a rep about their company and their goals. I was on the phone for over a half hour, just chatting about this product. It was clear to me how seriously they take this, and how much they depend on input from their customers.Another bonus is that this comes with a $25 Amazon gift card.

"I own about 12 vacuums, and 5 stick vacuums (I LOVE vacuums). This is the lightest, most maneuverable vacuum I've ever used.I have an older Electrolux stick vacuum, with a 12 volt battery and no handheld vacuum. This one picks up more dirt and dust (essential for hardwood floors), and doesn't kick around debris as much as my other Electrolux. I absolutely love the button you press to get rid of hair on the brush roller - genius idea.This has two speeds, and defaults to high speed when turning on. It's actually much quieter than my older Electrolux, but picks up better. It is insanely maneuverable - it literally turns on a dime. It weighs next to nothing, so this would be perfect for elderly relatives that are looking for something light and simple.The handheld vacuum is a very great feature (think DustBuster, except better). It's a bit oddly shaped, with a blunted front end and the vacuum portion on the lower part of that blunted end. It has a strange attachment with a brush head at the end. I found the attachment only frustrating to use, and really didn't help at all. It connects on the vacuum itself, in case you ever do want to use it.The battery lasts longer than any other battery in any stick vacuum I've used thus far. It easily lasts to do my entire first floor and then some. My only concern is that it has to plug directly into the wall - there is no stand to set it in. My older Electrolux has a stand to place it in, which looks better and is sturdier. This is just a plug you have to push into a random hole in the back of the vacuum, which seems a little cheap for a $130 vacuum.Overall, this is one of my favorite stick vacuums. Most highly recommended.PROS:LightTurns on a dimeBattery lasts foreverGreat suction for a stick vacuumHandheld is very convenientCONS:No stand to set the vacuum inOnly 2 speedsUseless attachment for handheld","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX96T6PCC043K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQHJV8C#wasThisHelpful","RX96T6PCC043K","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a ton of Contigo stuff, and this is the cheapest feeling bottle I own.What I LOVE about Contigo is that I never have any of their bottles leak. I use coffee mugs, insulated water mugs, sport bottles, and none of them leak. All my other Contigo bottles are stainless steel. This is the first plastic bottle I own.My daughter is 3, so I figured this would be perfect for her. Sure enough, it's leak proof and easy for kids to use. They have to squeeze/suck on the opening in order to get water, but she quickly figured it out.  It has a small flip-top straw from which they drink the liquids.I am really surprised at how flimsy the plastic bottle feels. It almost could be confused with a disposable water bottle, that's how thin it is. It's loud when squeezing, and reeks strongly of a chemical smell when you open it. Even though it's ""BPA free"", the chemical smell alone is enough to make me question my child drinking out of it.Overall it's OK, but I question the durability and materials from which it's made.

"We own a number if strollers and this is the nicest one we own. It's made of premium materials, which is clear to see the moment you open it.It's straightforward to put together as long as you follow the directions. At first I tried to wing it, but didn't get too far. The directions have detailed pictures though and were easy to follow. Mine also came with a USB stick with how-to videos, which was very helpful. It's clear a lot of thought was put into making this easy to assemble.The stroller is big, but folds up nicely. It's more compact when folded than I would have thought. It fits in the trunk of my Sonata, which surprised me.It holds up to 100 pounds, so our 3 year old fits with our 2 year old nephew perfectly. The wheels glide easily and turn very smoothly.

You pay a premium, but definitely get what you pay for in this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTJRDGLYSKP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4HDLGO#wasThisHelpful","R2GTJRDGLYSKP7","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with a Seagate drive. It was very easy to hook up. Just plug it in, connect ethernet cable directly to your router, create a username/password and you're good to go.There are ZERO instructions with this drive. So, I figured I'd just wing it. I have to say, it's been a very frustrating experience thus far.I tried backing up my laptop, as I have 1 TB of pictures on it. It said it was backing up, took FOREVER (overnight), then said ""failed"". I tried again, and ""failed"" again.I tried backing up my phone's pictures. It said ""can't connect to drive"", even though my drive is on the exact wifi network my phone is on, and I can access it from my laptop.It seems as though a lot of people are having the same complaints. Almost as if the software is half-baked, but you do get a 5 TB hard drive for storage.It can connect to Google Drive, Dropbox, and Windows online storage solutions. I tried backing my phone up through one of those services using the Seagate backup app, but it kept freezing and closing.I really can't explain why my phone, laptop, and work computer are having issues with the drive. I truly believe it's a software issue and not a hardware problem.  I hope Seagate can figure this stuff out, because this has a TON of good potential. But thus far, it's been very frustrating to try to get anything to work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6KI7A8T7SFTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZZZN84#wasThisHelpful","R6KI7A8T7SFTN","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Contigo products and own a number of their water bottles and coffee mugs. This mug is great for keeping water cool (not just cool) for 8+ hours. Personally, I never let water sit around that long because I drink a lot, but it's nice to know it's a feature.It's a nice looking bottle. The brushed blue is a nice color. It's 20 oz, so it holds quite a bit. It keeps water cold, which is really nice - I absolutely hate drinking room temperature water.The lid is plastic, and has a flip up ring to carry it. It's a bit of a clunky, uncomfortable way to carry the bottle, so I never use it. You push a button to flip open the lid, and snap it back closed. I'm not sure if my bottle is defective or if the lid is extraordinarily difficult to close, but the lid pops up easily unless you really slam it shut. It can lock, but it's very difficult (you have to use your fingernail).Overall it's a great way to keep water cold, but the lid needs some work. This is a common issue with every single Contigo bottle I own - they always have issues with their lids. They're making progress, but still need some work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BRAXF0DKXLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","R11BRAXF0DKXLE","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Porter Cable version of this kit, and this is basically identical. It's a 6 gallon pancake compressor with a brad nailer, finish nailer, and crown stapler.  It includes a 25' hose, though you'll likely want to get something longer and one that doesn't kink.It has two brass fittings to attach up to two nailers, which is nice. There's a valve to release pressure that works just like any other pancake compressor.I used this to build a chicken coop, and it worked beautifully. I have a large framing nailer, and this would let me shoot about 10 nails before turning on. It's just as loud as any other compressor I've used before.I'm always perplexed why these kits include crown staplers, as no one I know uses them. They have a niche use, mainly to attach thin pieces of wood trim on furniture and the like. It'd be nice if they included a framing nailer, though that would significantly increase the cost.Overall this is a nice kit that has brass fittings, instead of zinc, which is what you want.

"I own a number of air purifiers, so I feel that I have a discerning eye (and nose) when it comes to these units.  This Frigidaire is the most bare-bones unit of them all, priced higher than some other models that have more bells and whistles.It comes shipped in a massive box. It's not heavy but it is cumbersome, so keep that in mind if you're by yourself picking it up.It unboxes easily and is a breeze (no pun intended) to set up. Just take the plastic bag off, open the filter door, unwrap the filter, pop it back in, plug it in and you're good to go.It is a manual dial unit - no remote is available, unlike my other purifiers. It has 3 speeds - low, medium, and high. It does NOT oscillate, which is also different than some other units I own.This air purifier is as loud as a fan. No joke - I turned it on next to my Vornado fan, and sure enough, they are equally as loud. You definitely can feel the air being blasted out the front on the highest setting, but you will not want to turn it on while watching TV, for instance.This is NOT a HEPA filter, so keep that in mind if allergens are a serious problem in your household.Overall, this unit is just too loud to use in a room where people want to talk, watch TV, or entertain. The only rooms that would be acceptable would be a bedroom, assuming you like white noise. It's far louder than any other air purifier I own, and offers less bells and whistles for more money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAC4XXS489RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBJ8P5E#wasThisHelpful","RUAC4XXS489RX","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very large shop vac, and got this one for smaller projects. It's not built like a tank by any stretch - almost all plastic.  It comes with all the attachments you'd need, which is nice.What I don't like is that the cord, like most shop vacs, is super short. The exhaust blows dust everywhere, so you have to really be careful when you're vacuuming. It comes with a dust bag that apparently can be replaced for about $14 a bag, which is excessive.The small diameter hose plugs up, and it definitely can't pick up nails or any kind of metal. It's really only useful for sawdust and shavings, but nothing heavier than that.Overall, it's a decent little shop vac with average suction. It's good for smaller areas, but I would certainly get something much more powerful for a garage or large workshop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJUP6DZQ6C0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKJGIN0#wasThisHelpful","R1NJUP6DZQ6C0W","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a comforter that is light that wouldn't spew down feathers all over my bedroom. I wanted to like this one, but unfortunately it ended up being a cheap piece of junk.It smells when you open it - must let it air out for a few days. It has a shiny, crunchy texture to it. This is certainly not 1000 thread count material here (maybe 100 thread count is more accurate). It's not soft, nor does it provide a great amount of heat.My wife and I use separate comforters because she tosses and turns all night. I typically buy twin comforters and have no issue, but this one barely fit. I literally feel like I can't move at all or else I become uncovered. It's not wide or long enough, which is odd considering every other twin comforter I own fits me just fine.I suppose this would be fine for a child.

"I have multiples of these switches all throughout my house. I seriously don't know how I lived without them.  They are insanely convenient.They install easily, but you have to pay attention. SHUT OFF the breaker - don't be a hero. I zapped myself really bad the first time I tried putting one of these in. They come with easy to follow instructions with pictures. Just connect the appropriate wires, pop in a faceplate (not included) and you're done.This is a motion sensor with dimmer. What that means is that it will automatically turn on the light when it's dark. When it's light, it doesn't turn the lights on. When it's dark, it does. And you can set the dimmer so that the lights turn on at a brightness you want. You can manually dim the lights on the switch, and manually turn off the lights as well. You can set it so it turns them up to the brightness you want, which is nice.This works with LED light bulbs. It will work with CFLs, but it won't dim them and you can burn out the switch (it hums badly). So you should only use this with LED bulbs.You can set the timer so the light stays on for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. Super easy to program.

"Trying to get a 3 year old to pay attention long enough to learn a game is impossible. Luckily, this required no set-up - just open and play.Rules are simple. Pick 5 animals (your ""cards""), and take turns playing each one. Skunks are ""skips"" and farmers are ""wilds"". There are no reverses or draw 4 wilds like the regular Uno game.The animals are easy to stand up and manipulate by little hands. My daughter loves playing with them and carrying around the barn.

"We've owned a number of swings over the years, but this is far and away our favorite. Fisher Price makes solid baby equipment, and we have been very pleased using this swing.It's very, very easy to assemble. It comes with well written, easy to follow instructions. And once it's put together, it's a cinch to use. Just hit a button, make adjustments with other buttons, and you're set to go.We love that it rocks side to side or front to back. We found our daughter actually preferred front to back, and it's very easy to switch between the two. The motion is smooth and adjusts for your child's weight, which is pretty ingenious. The rocking motion is very smooth and not at all jerky, which is very important with a newborn!It comes with music and toys, but we use our own white noise and didn't hang up the toys. We use this strictly when our baby can't sleep but we know is overtired, so we don't want distractions.It's one of the nicest swings available and blends in nicely with any decor. It doesn't have a bunch of ""kiddie"" stuff all over it, screaming to visitors ""WE HAVE CHILDREN"" as soon as they walk in the door.The swing takes up quite a bit of real estate, so I suggest keeping it near an outlet. It runs on batteries, but it's such a pain to move so we just keep it stationary next to our couch.We could not be happier with a baby swing.

"This is the 5th stick vacuum I've used, and it ranks somewhere in the middle. It is super easy to put together - just a screw and you're done. It's very lightweight and easily maneuverable, so it gets under sofas and tables quite well.It has the option to turn on/off a roller bar, for rugs and carpets. I find if using the roller bar on hardwood floors, it just kicks up debris all over the place. However, the suction without the bar just isn't quite strong enough to get much beyond hairballs and other light stuff. It definitely isn't strong enough to pick up dust, so I still have to use my Swiffer.It comes with only 1 lithium ion battery, which is a pain. When it runs out of juice, the vacuum just shuts off. So you have to charge the battery before using the vacuum again. It would be nice to have some kind of warning.The canister detaches so you can use it like the old ""dust busters"" from the 80s. The suction is not that great, so it's only good for light stuff. I found it wouldn't suck up shredded cheese that was on my countertop, for instance. It comes with a really great roller ball attachment for the dust buster part, which is great for vacuuming a couch or the stairs.Pros:LightweightEasily maneuverableVersatileDetaches to a dust buster for handheld dutiesCons:only one battery, doesn't last that long on a chargeSuction is not the best","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Y0LN0EO8P40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1N4#wasThisHelpful","R17Y0LN0EO8P40","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love vacuuming. Seriously. Love. I jumped at the chance to try out this vacuum.I own a number of Hoover vacuums, along with a Dyson (all corded). So this review will be in comparison to those vacuums.This is very easy to put together. One screw, attach the attachments, and you're done. It comes with TWO lithium ion batteries and a separate wall charger, which is nice. When the battery dies, the vacuum just turns off. It doesn't lose suction, slow down, etc - just shuts off. I actually like this, because if it lost suction and then died, I'd have to change the battery and go back over all the areas I just vacuumed.It's got a small, easily maneuverable head. It can reach under sofas and tables easier than any corded vacuum I've owned. The main cylinder detaches so you can easily vacuum stairs - a wonderful feature. It's got basic attachments (nozzle, brush), and they fit easily on the vacuum.The suction is good for a cordless. It has a ""boost"" button, which I have on at all times. You can turn on/off the brush roller. It gets along baseboards far better than any other vacuum I've ever used because it has side brushes. I LOVE that feature.If the vacuum roller gets stuck in a rug, the vacuum shuts off and won't turn back on. I had to remove the battery and wait a minute, then it would work again. I'm not sure if it's a safety feature, but it was rather annoying.The cylinder is easy to empty, and the filter is washable which is a nice touch. Everything is very easy to operate.Due to the fact that this is cordless, this makes me vacuum much more than I used to. It's easy just to do a room here and there and not have to worry about a cord. Due to this fact alone, this is well worth the price.  I highly recommend it!Pros:Very lightweightEasily maneuverableConvenient - makes me vacuum more2 batteries, last a long timeVersatile - great on stairsCons:Suction not quite as good as corded vacuumShuts off if roller bar gets stuck on rug and doesn't turn back on for several minutesCanister is small for size of vacuum","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1727CY552REJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","R1727CY552REJX","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an older Windows desktop and needed to upgrade the wifi capabilities. I have a number of TP-Link products, and while they are the ""bargain"" line of wifi products, they usually provide a pretty good value. This card performed very well for me.This needs a PCI-express adapter, which is on nearly every desktop motherboard produced within the last decade. It's super easy to install - remove the door to access the inside of the computer, slip this card in the slot (it only fits one way), put case back on. Easy, breezy.It comes with all the necessary drivers on a disc, but if you don't have an optical drive, everything can be downloaded from TP-Link's website.This worked beautifully with my Windows 7 desktop. It instantly found my wireless connection, and connected as soon as I entered our password. It matches speeds of all my other AC wireless devices, and I have not yet lost a connection.  Thus far, it's been quite reliable.I'm a bit surprised at the price of this card, as wireless USB AC dongles are less than half the price. But this is a more permanent fixture, doesn't have the lag time that USB dongles have at establishing a connection, and doesn't take up a precious USB port.

It's easy to grip, spill-proof, and should allow an easier transition to a regular cup. We found that our daughter really struggled to suck on the lip to get her milk, which is the only way this cup releases liquids.

"This is my first experience with any of the Far Cry games. Though I'm a bit lost on the characters, the story is still compelling.This is played from first person perspective. You are Ajay Ghale, returning to the country in which you were raised to spread your mother's ashes. It is in civil disarray, ruled by tyrannical Pagan Min (he's pictured on the cover). You join rebel forces Golden Path, with the help of Sabal (voiced by Naveen Andrews, who played Sayid in TV's Lost).The game is absolutely beautiful. This is the most gorgeous video game I have ever seen (I'm playing on my 120"" projection screen with 5.1 surround sound). The sound is amazing as well, as gunshots whiz by my ears based on the location in which they're coming from.It's an open world game play, meaning that you have <some> direction with your missions, but are free to explore as you like. There are unending side missions which were fun at first, but get a little tiresome after the 10th time doing the same thing.You can ride cars, elephants, boats, snowmobiles - basically whatever you want. A lot of the gameplay involves stealth, which can be fun but also tedious. Replaying the same mission over and over because you keep getting busted gets a little repetitive. But overall, it's still very fun.It's a very long game (about 15 hours for just the main missions, but 40 hours if you wanted to complete everything). There is a ton of replay value here, as you can make different choices each time around which can alter the game a bit. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.

"This is an intriguing concept for those that find monitoring HR during a workout useful. I hate using chest straps, even though they're most accurate, mainly due to the discomfort and pain-in-the-you know what to take on and off. These monitor your heart rate through the ear buds, which is a really cool concept.I've used these with a Moto X, and they work well. You have to download and install Runkeeper Elite in order to take advantage of the HR monitoring feature. You get ONE free month with these buds, but to keep using the HR features, it'll cost $10/mo or $30/year for the app. That's something that should be included for life with these ear buds, or at least highlighted on the box. I think people buying these may be a bit mislead about this issue.The HR function worked well for me, though I had a few workouts where it would either cut out and not work, or say my HR was 134 bpm the entire workout without changing. I usually had to quit the app and restart it, though at times even that didn't remedy the issue. They seem to be buggy, and I'm guessing it's a software issue.The sound quality is decent, but because these are not in-ear-monitors (IEMs), they do not provide a good seal to your ear canal. Therefore, bass is weak, sound is thin, and outside noise affects sound quality. They are nowhere near as good sounding as my $30 IEMs that I usually use to workout. That's disappointing, considering these cost $150.There are no volume/skip controls on the wire, which is also disappointing. There is a mic, however, so you can use these to talk. I can't say I've never felt compelled to make phone calls while working out, however.Overall, this is a niche product that is buggy with mediocre sound quality. It's innovative, however, and I'm hoping more products like this are made in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U76ZIMT2ZCJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDHXL8I#wasThisHelpful","R3U76ZIMT2ZCJN","A2FWZ58M6IQMD7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FWZ58M6IQMD7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Certain composers seem to be known for only a handful of works (sometimes only one or two), even though their actual output may be far larger; and it seems that way with Charles Gounod.  For many, he is known for one of the great French operas of the 19th century in “Faust”, and for his surprisingly jolly but nevertheless macabre “Funeral March Of A Marionette” (which gained extreme fame by being appropriated for TV in the late 1950s by a portly British filmmaker named Hitchcock).  And for others, there is his “Ave Maria”, actually based upon the Prelude No. 1 of J.S. Bach, and henceforth known as the Bach/Gounod “Ave Maria.”But what many people didn’t realize until just the last few decades was that Gounod also wrote a pair of very well-constructed symphonies which are really French extensions of the Viennese style of the late 18th/early 19th century, primarily Haydn and Mozart, but also Beethoven and Schubert.  The First Symphony, in the oft-used key of D Major, is an efficient and largely unheard work of the winter of 1854-55, with a very clever use of the woodwind section; it is said to have inspired a student of his, Georges Bizet, to compose his own symphony (which, after being subverted for 80 years, finally emerged in 1935 to much acclaim and a place in the repertoire that the work it was modeled off of hasn’t yet received).  One could argue that both Gounod’s First, and Bizet’s C Major, along with their Viennese forebears, helped to influence Sergei Prokofiev in the composition of his own Classical Symphony in 1917.Ironically, Gounod’s First Symphony was so well received in its 1855 premiere that he quickly composed his Second Symphony, this time somewhat lengthier than its immediate predecessor with slightly enhanced orchestral forces and in the key of E Flat Major, possibly influenced by both Mozart’s 39th and Beethoven’s Eroica which are in that key (Schubert’s early symphonies also seem to figure into the mix as well).  Again, the symphony, fairly well proportioned and full of wit, was very well received by audiences of its time; but it too has since languished in relative obscurity.The other piece on this 1997 recording by Sir Neville Marriner and his Academy of St. Martin In The Fields is, of course, the Walpurgis Night Ballet Music that is heard in Act 5 of “Faust”, where Mephisto presents the all-too-ambitious Faust with illusions of seductive and mythic beauties.  The ballet suite here climaxes with the rather grisly “Danse de Phryne”, which helped enhance the opera’s reputation, and also for enhancing the reputation of French composers of exploring the macabre in music (e.g. Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique”; Saint-Saens’ “Danse Macabre”).Marriner and the orchestra he had founded in 1959 give exceptionally superb performances of the two still relatively unknown symphonies of Gounod’s; and the performance of the Faust Ballet music is as good as one can get in a modern context (though Paul Paray’s brilliant 1962 recording of it with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, on a Mercury Living Presence CD of French opera excerpts, also includes the famous waltz of the opera’s second act).  Gounod should be much better known in recordings and in concert halls than he is; and hopefully Marriner and the ASMF have helped make his resurrection in the public music sphere just a little more possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q6DXEZ2R90V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JLFE#wasThisHelpful","R12Q6DXEZ2R90V","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given how much early on in his life he labored under the shadow of Beethoven, it is a wonder that Johannes Brahms was even able to get to finish his First Symphony, let alone compose three more.  But this is what he managed to do, combining the structural form of Beethoven, and the lyricism inherent in Mozart and Schubert, to produce four masterpieces in the form.  The last of them, along with his two concert overtures, is featured on this CD that is taken from recordings made by Leonard Bernstein and his New York Philharmonic in the early 1960s.The Fourth Symphony, in E Minor, is a very solemn-sounding affair from the get-go, its opening measures suggesting the autumn of Brahms’ years, while the work’s Andante movement (in E Major) suggests an inner strength through peace.  The third movement has some of Brahms’ largest orchestration, with tubas, trombones, and a triangle in evidence, and is the only official full-blown symphonic scherzo he ever wrote (he had avoided writing at this tempo in part because the symphonic scherzos of Beethoven so overpowered him), while the final movement is in the form of a Passacaglia, but also returning at times to the waltz-like tempo that occurs at the opening.  Part of this tempo may have had a fair amount to do with the friendship he shared with the Vienna waltz king Johann Strauss II.The two concert overtures, both from 1881, don’t necessarily sound like they could have been written by the same composer.  “One laughs, the other weeps”, Brahms was noted to have said.  The Academic Festival Overture, which begins in C Minor but ends in C Major, was a work that the composer dedicated to Breslau University, which had recently bequeathed him the title of Doctor of Philosophy; it has the largest orchestra of any of his major orchestral works, including not only a triangle but crashing cymbals as well.  The Tragic Overture is an entirely different work—a turbulent work in D Minor, the same key as his First Piano Concerto and the Beethoven Ninth, rife with tensions, and climaxing with an overwhelming sense of darkness that tended to inform Brahms even before this, if only in small parts.All three works were given very solid performances by Bernstein and the New York Phil, and there seems not to have been any age put on them, despite the fact that they were recorded over half a century ago (the Fourth on October 9, 1962; the Academic Festival Overture on October 7, 1963; and the Tragic Overture on May 1, 1964).  As such, this CD (the 21st of the 100 in CBS/Sony’s Leonard Bernstein Royal Edition) is highly recommended, and should be sought out for the solid renderings of these late 19th century warhorses contained within.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCONKCOJAIASX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000027M6#wasThisHelpful","RCONKCOJAIASX","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In today’s corporate-run radio world, especially when it comes to country music, it isn’t too surprising that a Canadian singer with a Hispanic surname like Lindi Ortega isn’t a bigger star.But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a travesty, because it is—a HUGE one.  With the exceptions of Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert, country music has thrown a lot of potentially great women under their Silver Eagle bus in favor of the grotesque junk called “Bro Country”; and Lindi, no matter how “indie” she is or how “retro” she looks, is one of them.  Although she has been around since 2002, I have only heard about her recently.  But now, with her new album FADED GLORYVILLE, I wish her all the best.  This is shaping up to be among the best albums of 2015.Lindi’s quirky style, though rooted in authentic country and R&B styles, also runs the gamut, from classic Elvis and Johnny Cash to the Bakersfield sound of the 1960s, the 1980s “cow punk” of Maria McKee and her band Lone Justice, and even the classic country-rock of Linda Ronstadt.  Wisely, though, she incorporates those styles very fluidly without ever sounding deliberately imitative of her predecessors.  There’s a lot of genuine spunk in her voice on songs like the classically rockabilly track “Run Amuck”, as well as “Run Down Neighborhood”, and more traditional 1960s honky-tonk twang on the almost autobiographical title track, and the quirky “I Ain’t The Girl” (in our current context, it can be easily interpreted as a riposte to those faux-country “Bro Country” boys like Florida-Georgia Line, Jason Aldean, or Luke Bryan).  Lindi also does an R&B-flavored version, inspired by Nina Simone’s rendition, of the Bee Gees’ classic 1967 hit “To Love Somebody” (which they supposedly wrote for Otis Redding [sadly, he didn’t live long enough to record it]), and does justice to it.  And a little bit of Linda’s influence rubs off on Lindi (subliminally) on songs like “Half Moon” and “When You Ain’t Home” (which has some of the influence of Linda’s 1976 version of “That’ll Be The Day”).Much like some of my recent favorite female artists (Tift Merritt; Caitlin Rose), Lindi is someone who deserves to be taken seriously because of her very studious ability to channel her many influences into something truly authentically her.  If that kind of authenticity is passed over by a country radio format soaked in frat-party anthems and booze, then it’s country radio’s fault AND its loss, and not Lindi’s.  Fans of country and roots-rock that’s both traditional and progressive should get this album post-haste!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDGP00U6U6W6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3BXVRK#wasThisHelpful","RDGP00U6U6W6J","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Her millions of fans, and the generations of female peers in the music business who have been influenced by her, were heartbroken in August 2013 when Linda Ronstadt announced that her voice had been forever silenced by Parkinson’s Disease.  The loss of Linda’s great voice, in an era where people take great singers for granted now and where Autotune and other studio gimmicks are accepted as givens, was enormous.  And yet, the Arizona-born songstress left a body of work, t he diversity of which is unlikely to ever be heard of again.  It is a body of work that encompasses a staggering amount of genres: pop; rock; R&B; blues; country; jazz; opera; Mexican rancheras (which she grew up extensively on as a youngster); gospel; folk; and bluegrass.Absent any hidden material in the vaults, compilations are likely the only way anyone is going to be able to hear Linda now.  But the latest one, JUST ONE LOOK: CLASSIC LINDA RONSTADT, is a big 2-CD collection consisting of thirty of Linda’s greatest vocal performances, many of them hits, and others very classic album cuts, spanning from her start in the Stone Poneys with the folk-rock classic “Different Drum” in 1967 through to the album tracks on her tragically underappreciated 1993 album WINTER LIGHT.  All of these have been re-mastered in a way that still keeps the focus on her incredibly wide-ranging voice, whose range went from alto to soprano, even to coloratura soprano for her journeys into classical opera in the 1980s.  Inevitably, people will comment (rightly, I think) on the absence of such unquestioned classics as “Long Long Time” (her second hit, from 1970), or tracks from her albums of American standards and Spanish-language projects; and one hopes those will be re-mastered at some point in the future as well.Still, whether one is a die-hard fan or a first-timer, this is a great way to get started into hearing what people growing up between the late 1960s and the early 1990s knew about Linda.  Obvious hits like “You’re No Good”, “Blue Bayou”, “Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me”, and her huge 1989 Grammy-winning duet with Aaron Neville, “Don’t Know Much”, are included in there, but so are some forgotten (at least by the current generation of radio listeners) gems as “Love Has No Pride”, “Crazy” (her torchy take on the immortal 1961 Patsy Cline classic); “Just One Look” (Linda’s 1978 revival of Doris Troy’s 1963 hit that serves as this collection’s title); “Someone To Lay Down Beside Me” (written by her good friend Karla Bonoff); “I Can’t Help It If I’m Still In Love With You” (her big 1974 revival of the Hank Williams classic, featuring her pal Emmylou Harris on harmony vocals); “I Never Will Marry” (the traditional Appalachian folk ballad that has Linda on acoustic guitar, and her other TRIO pal Dolly Parton on harmonies); and her impassioned version of her former backing band the Eagles’ classic “Desperado.”  And there are also her 1980s hits “How Do I Make You?”, “Hurt So Bad” and “Get Closer” that are going criminally neglected on so-called “oldies” radio stations that have gone all-Eighties on us.  And all that is just for starters.It is a shame that up until her Parkinson’s diagnosis, Linda was all but forgotten in the mainstream press; on the same weekend that she announced her diagnosis, it was overshadowed in the media by the overblown focus on Miley Cyrus’ idiotic “twerking” at the VMAs.  And even in the industry, it took the powers-that-be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame an unconscionably long time to induct her into their “club.”  But this huge 2-CD collection hopefully will remind people of how big a deal she was, from Emmylou, Nicolette Larson, Rosanne Cash and Jennifer Warnes, through to Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride, Lucinda Williams, and Sheryl Crow, and up to present-day singers like Tift Merritt, Caitlin Rose, and Lindi Ortega.  It will also hopefully remind people of just how much further Taylor Swift still has to go in order to be in Linda’s class as well.Linda Ronstadt is someone deserving of all the accolades she receives, even though she is arguably modest to a fault when talking about it all.  This collection just helps to solidify her stature, which is right up there with Elvis and the Beatles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LMHN02KOER1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013L23ADM#wasThisHelpful","R37LMHN02KOER1","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Besides a very long stint as the general artistic director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, as well as a frequent conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (plus recordings of Schubert’s and Schumann’s symphonies in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the Dresden State Orchestra), the German conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch served a solid ten-year term from 1993 to 2003 (and from 2003 to his passing in 2013 as Conductor Laureate) of the Philadelphia Orchestra, continuing a great tradition handed down from Leopold Stokowski to Eugene Ormandy and Riccardo Muti (and being continued today under the young French-Canadian conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin).  His impressive recordings of the many tone poems of Richard Strauss with the orchestra for EMI are among the greatest that they’ve ever received.Among these other things, however, he conducted some relatively less-known works of the Austro-German repertoire for the orchestra’s own record label as Conductor Laureate.  This particular live recording, made in 2007 and released in 2010, is just such an example.The disc opens up with a surprisingly lesser known work of Felix Mendelssohn, his “Calm Sea And Prosperous Voyage” concert overture in D Major, which begins serenely on the open sea at sunrise, and then depicts the progress of the wind and sea currents as it guides a ship safely to its port-of-call before it ends as serenely as it started.  The work is inspired by the same two poems by Goethe that inspired a similarly titled cantata of the same name by Beethoven; and Sawallisch and the orchestra handle it with the right pacing and drama.Sawallisch and the orchestra also feature two very prominent overtures for a pair of operas by Carl Maria von Weber that more or less began the genre of the German Romantic opera, those to “Oberon” and the work that is generally regarded as the composer’s masterpiece in the form, “Der Freischutz.”  While I don’t know how many times the Philadelphians had performed these overtures before, if at all (perhaps under Ormandy’s tenure), they do handle them very well under Sawallisch’s concise and dramatic direction, with their fabulous string section very much in evidence.The disc also includes two works by Robert Schumann.  The first of these is the highly dramatic overture for his only opera, “Genoveva”, composed in 1850.  The second of these would be considered an actual symphony save for the fact that it lacks a slow movement, the 1841 Overture, Scherzo, and Finale, in E Minor and E Major.  Sawallisch had recorded this three-movement “mini-symphony” as part of his Schumann symphonic cycle in 1972 for EMI with the Dresden State Orchestra; and he gets impressive results from the Philadelphians as well.Philadelphia and its world-class orchestra were fortunate to have Sawallisch at the helm, extending the tradition of great music-making, from the famous strings to the burnished brass section; and the live performances of works that one doesn’t often hear from American orchestras was proof of how much he valued that tradition.  One should not hesitate to pick this recording up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRG8L1VCAGSNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00321014Y#wasThisHelpful","RRG8L1VCAGSNS","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like one of the most quixotic pairings of works on a CD—the thoroughly American historical piece that is Aaron Copland’s “Lincoln Portrait” being combined with the toweringly self-autobiographical symphonic tone poem “Ein Heldenleben” (A Hero’s Life) of Richard Strauss.  And yet that’s what London/Decca’s Japanese imports division has done on this particular CD, both featuring the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Zubin Mehta, the conductor that, during his 16-year tenure from 1962 to 1978, elevated this orchestra to the world-class prominence it has held ever since.Lincoln Portrait is fairly self-explanatory, a work for narrator and orchestra whose text takes from the various important speeches in the life of our nation’s 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, including his views on freedom and slavery, and those important words that he said on the battlefield at Gettysburg (“that Government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”).  Such a great work, though only fifteen minutes in length, requires an orator of considerable stature; and that’s what this recording has in the form of the legendary actor Gregory Peck, who would actually portray Lincoln in the 1982 CBS-TV miniseries “The Blue And The Gray”, and had won an Oscar in 1962 for his role of Atticus Finch in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  This particular recording dates from 1969.The performance here of “Ein Heldenleben” dates from 1966, and illustrates the way Mehta had of integrating the large-scale Romantic Viennese sound of Strauss and his contemporaries into what everyone used to think of as a provincial West Coast orchestra (people tend to forget that the influence was already in many of the orchestra’s musicians, who enjoyed careers in the various film studio orchestras around town).  Mehta and the L.A. Phil managed with this recording to supercede what Fritz Reiner had done with this work with his Chicago Symphony (they’d pull that trick again two years later in 1968 with the composer’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra”, in the immediate aftermath of that work’s opening measures being used in so cagily a cinematic way by director Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY); the stentorian Strauss brass sound, especially the horn section, is rendered with maximum impact, even after close to half a century.We here in Los Angeles have reason to be proud of the L.A. Phil, but we should also congratulate Mehta’s fine stewardship with the orchestra for having made it into one of the world’s great orchestras.  This pairing of two “heroic” works from two extremely different composers is ironclad proof of this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7A4SPSHNKMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8XYTOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1O7A4SPSHNKMG","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s hard to think of anything that Meryl Streep hasn’t done in a career that goes all the way back to the 1970s.  But with RICKI AND THE FLASH, we find out something brand new.  She rocks!  Literally!Re-teaming up with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS director Jonathan Demme (the two had worked together on Demme’s 2004 updating of the 1962 Cold War classic THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, where she played Angela Lansbury’s part), Streep stars as Ricki Randazzo, a wanted-to-be rock and roll star who had one brief moment of success in the 80s, but is now consigned to play out her strings (all six of them) out at the dingy Salt Well club in Tarzana with her band The Flash and her boyfriend (played by Rick Springfield, he of “Jessie’s Girl” fame).  But soon, she has a calling from Indianapolis; the family she left behind to follow her rock and roll dreams is rapidly falling apart, most noticeably in the suicidal tendencies of her daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer, who is Streep’s real-life daughter), and her ex-husband (Kevin Kline, teaming with Streep for only the second time, the first being 1982’s SOPHIE’S CHOICE) trying to hold things together with a new wife (Audra MacDonald).  With real life intruding in, the collision of her love for performing and wanting to set things right with her family, Streep’s character sometimes looks like she’s closer to having a nervous breakdown than even her own daughter.  But with Springfield’s help, she comes to her daughter’s wedding (with the band in tow, unbeknownst to the uptight, upper-crust crowd there who know very little of her past), and manages to redeem herself in a lot of great ways.Streep, who had done music-themed movies before (having done her own singing in 1990’s POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, and portrayed a music teacher in 1999’s MUSIC OF THE HEART), just doesn’t seem capable of doing any wrong in films, and so it is sometimes quite easy to take her and her generation for granted (though contemporary Hollywood often seems to take that generation for granted way too many times).  Playing Ricki, however, was quite a stretch for her all the same; and she manages to pull it off quite well, doing quite the job of playing acoustic and electric guitars and singing for this role in a way that, dare one say it, could have her in line for yet another Oscar nomination, if not another outright win.  This shouldn’t take away from the other great supporting performances, including Springfield, Kline (whose wryness and off-the-cuff humor are exceptionally refreshing), and MacDonald, let alone Gummer, who has some extremely interesting scenes with her mother (though reportedly they spent very little time together off the set during the making of the film per Demme’s instructions).  Demme’s direction is also quite good (he refrains from doing the straight face-on shots of previous films); and the film features longtime Eagles/Joe Walsh backing musician Joe Vitale as the Flash’s drummer, and a soundtrack that includes a lot of rock classics that Streep sings on her own (quite well, I would add).This is not a typical summer-movie flick with high-octane action (unless one considers Streep’s stage presence an example of an “action” scene); and yet RICKI AND THE FLASH will likely end up being considered one of the best films of 2015.  It’s already one of mine, for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFRFJWKYI1HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FAN5RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OFRFJWKYI1HK","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although he was known for having made a lot of grand statements in the musical language of his native Bohemia, notably in his last four symphonies, and various symphonic tone poems, Antonin Dvorak was also able to think small, as was the case on this 1981 Delos recording by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra under their then-Music Director Gerard Schwarz.The most popular of these works, and indeed the work that bought Dvorak his first real attention, whether in Bohemia or beyond, is his 1875 “Serenade For Strings”, cast in the most unusual key of E Major and scored strictly for the string section in the manner of Mozart’s celebrated “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik”, but with two middle movements, one of which is a Waltz and the other a Scherzo, that show the effects of the Romantic movement in music that was occurring at the time.The second work on this (surprisingly short, at 40 minutes) CD is “Waldesruhe”, also known as “Silent Woods”, a work that Dvorak originally composed for the piano duet “From The Bohemian Forest”, and then extended out as work for cello and small orchestra.  It differs quite substantially from its gigantic cousin the B Minor Cello Concerto, because of its very pastoral nature, and as such it is not as widely well known.  But after hearing this performance, with the LACO’s principal cellist Douglas Davis in the solo role, you will likely have to wonder why that is.The third and final work here is the “Notturno” in B Major for string orchestra that had originally appeared in his 1870 E Minor String Quartet, but expanded it into string orchestra form.  Although it does bear the effects of some of Wagner’s modernism, it really has more in common with Beethoven’s “Grosse Fugue” and Mozart’s “Adagio And Fugue” than Wagner; and it remains one of Dvorak’s most spiritual pieces.Despite the shortness of this CD, the performances by Davis and his fellow musicians under Schwarz’s direction make this a superlative recording to have, especially for those who want to know if Dvorak could think in smaller but no less compelling musical terms.  He clearly did here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN739AUTR8ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000006V8#wasThisHelpful","R1UN739AUTR8ZN","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first two decades of the 20th century were very active ones for Russia’s leading composers, especially in the area of instrumental concertos.  This was particularly true in the field of the violin concerto, where the true supreme Russian contribution, namely the D Major one of Tchaikovsky, had become an established part of the repertoire by the beginning of the 20th century.Alexander Glazunov’s A Minor violin concerto leads off this particular collection.  Cast in three uninterrupted movements and lasting twenty minutes, it was the first post-Tchaikovsky concerto for that instrument to attain success around the world, and is most likely this composer’s greatest and best-known work.  The lush romanticism of the piece is very evident, giving us a glimpse into what was to come in terms of other Russian violin concertos, including the other one on here.Sergei Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 1, in a traditional D Major key, though it ventures into other keys as well, was one of the many ways back in 1917 that he responded to the criticism that his music was too dissonant and that it had no form.  Save for the orchestration that requires a snare drum and a single tuba, however, this concerto is proportioned more along the lines of the classic lines of concertos from Beethoven and Mendelssohn through Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Glazunov.  In that same year of 1917, Prokofiev would also go even further back, symphonically speaking, with his ever-popular Classical Symphony (#1), which was an homage to the late 18th century Viennese style of Haydn and Mozart.The other work on this recording is “Stihira”, a large-scale work by the modern-day Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin that the composer described as a “Hymn for the Millennium Of The Christianization Of Russia” (slightly premature as, when this work was premiered in Washington in 1987, Russia was still under the, albeit loosening, yoke of atheistic Communism).  It is scored for a fairly huge orchestra, with four extra groups of percussion players, in a way that would make this piece even rival Tchaikovsky’s famous “1812 Overture.”The great German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter is on hand to deliver sterling performances of both of the early 20th century Russian violin concertos in a way that brings out their lush Romanticism and irony; and both of those works, plus “Stihira”, are excellently performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington D.C. and their music director (and legendary cellist) Mstislav Rostropovich, who led the orchestra from 1977 to 1995.  This is a great combination of 20th century Russian works to have in one’s collection, and is thus highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVY27T07GG37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E8SP#wasThisHelpful","R3QVY27T07GG37","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout his conducting sojourn, from his early years in Boston, to Buffalo, to being associate conductor of his own hometown Los Angeles Philharmonic, Michael Tilson Thomas has shown an enormous passion for the music of George Gershwin, music that showed the composer to be more than a tunesmith of some of the greatest songs ever written on our shores.  This has held true since having become music director of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1995, succeeding Herbert Blomstedt.  And in 1998, he, the orchestra, and a trio of all stars got together to celebrate what would have been the composer's 100th birthday, a birthday celebration that was wisely captured on this 2-CD collection.For this event, recorded at the orchestra's home Davies Symphony Hall, Thomas assembled a very solid pair of vocal soloists, Audra MacDonald and Brian Stokes Mitchell, to take on the songs featured in the Catfish Row Suite of the composer's landmark opera ""Porgy And Bess"" (arguably the American equivalent of ""The Marriage Of Figaro"" and ""Carmen"" in terms of operas). including ""Bess You Is My Woman Now"" and ""Summertime"" (the latter a song that has become an incredibly durable standard, also being a big pop hit in 1966 for Billy Stewart, and even recorded by Janis Joplin).  Thomas then does double duty conducting the S.F.S.O. from the piano in the composer's (surprisingly seldom recorded) 1931 Second Rhapsody, which is frequently known as ""Rhapsody In Rivets.""  After hearing the performance of this piece, one can only surmise that the overwhelming popularity of the earlier ""Rhapsody In Blue"" is the one thing that keeps this work from being better known than it is.The second CD on this collection begins with Thomas and the orchestra giving us a spirited version of the composer's ""tone poem"" ""An American In Paris"", with its vivid jazz-like phrasings.  Then Thomas retakes the podium to conduct the composer's Piano Concerto In F, leaving the piano solo duties to the marvelous Garrick Ohlsson, who clearly knows his way around the piece, a work that, with so many twists, turns, and piano crescendos, makes it every bit a challenge as the concertos of Rachmaninoff and Ravel.This 2-CD collection is a tremendous way of celebrating a composer who, as much as anyone else, helped define the sound of American music in the 20th century.  Thomas, his orchestra, and his soloists should be congratulated for making this a great birthday present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y44PB5T8KZ3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00386JWKM#wasThisHelpful","R1Y44PB5T8KZ3S","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a concert pianist worth his or her salt, the twenty-seven piano concertos of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are essential to your repertoire.  And if you are also a conductor, then Mozart should always be in your repertoire.Such is the case with Andre Previn.  While most remembered for his recordings of 20th century English composers like Walton and Vaughan Williams, plus works by such Russian titans as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Rachmaninoff, and Tchaikovsky, even Previn, whose career has featured tenures in London, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, as well as a very solid composer of film music (BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, in 1955), knows that one must tackle the core Viennese repertoire.  This he does on this recording from the mid-1980s, in which he does two of W.A. Mozart’s piano concertos, conducting, from his place at the piano, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.Though these two concertos are by the same composer, they are also totally different as well.  The 17th concerto, in G Major, which Mozart composed in 1784, is a lightly orchestrated affair; but No. 24, composed less than two years later, is, because of its C Minor key, the darkest and most turbulent work Mozart had composed in the genre (also the only concerto, besides the D Minor 20th, in a minor key), and with the largest orchestration of any of them (sans trombones).  Yet both these concertos would have a profound influence even beyond Mozart’s tragically truncated lifetime, with Beethoven taking inspiration for his C Minor Third Piano Concerto from Mozart's 24th.Previn, known more for his conducting than his piano work (except when going into jazz), nevertheless is able to manage the exceptionally tricky feat of performing these concertos from the keyboard while conducting the frequently-hard-to-please Vienna Philharmonic.  This is a pairing of concertos that is duplicated by Irish pianist John O’Conor and conductor Sir Charles Mackerras (with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra) on Telarc; and the Previn/Vienna version here (originally released on the Philips label) is on a par with the O’Conor/Mackerras/SCO version.  It is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGN5T0H14FLP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBAT74E#wasThisHelpful","RGN5T0H14FLP1","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Leonard Bernstein had an inkling of his own morality as the 1980s came to a close, either he wasn’t yet aware of it or, in concert and on recordings, he was going to give the most of it, no matter how much slower his conducting tempos had become since his golden years of the 1960s.  This seems to have been borne out in his recordings of Tchaikovsky’s final three symphonies that he made with his New York Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon.This particular recording pairs the composer’s Fate-orientated Fifth Symphony (in E Minor) with perhaps the most popular of his symphonic tone poems, the Romeo And Juliet Fantasy Overture.  The two overriding Fate themes in the symphony’s opening movement (unsurprisingly extended in length by Bernstein’s arguably hyperemotional approach) are overriding concerns that the composer wrestles with; while the D Major slow movement (though rent with some violent outbursts) is more tranquil and a touch heartbreaking at times.  The third movement, basically a kind of off-kilter waltz in A Major, is one that has led a lot of people to argue that Tchaikovsky’s symphonies are too balletic in nature (and vice-versa for his three ballets, thought by some to bee “too symphonic”).  All the tensions are resolved in a very triumphant finale, in which the two Fate motifs of the first movement are intermingled with vigorous outbursts for a resolution in E Major.  This is also the only major work of Tchaikovsky’s, symphonic or otherwise, following the Third Symphony, to eschew any extra percussion (cymbals; tam-tams), so that it can be argued that it is closer to a more traditional Brahms-type work.  But Lenny and his forces spare nothing else otherwise.Of course, the piece-de-resistance is “Romeo And Juliet”; and as seems to be typical of Tchaikovsky, he deals with tragedy in its purest form in his depiction of Shakespeare’s timeless story of star-crossed lovers belonging to warring families who are only able to bring those sides together by doing themselves in.  From the work’s portentous opening to the fight scenes, the heart-wrenching love theme, and the cataclysmic finale (with rumbling timpani), the work is done exceptionally well by the N.Y.P.O. and its conductor.  It helps that Bernstein knows a thing or two about this work and its origins; after all, he himself, along with Stephen Sondheim, created a Romeo And Juliet-inspired work entitled “West Side Story.”The Fifth Symphony was recorded in November 1988, and Romeo And Juliet recorded in October 1989 (around the same time as Bernstein’s recordings of the composer’s Fourth Symphony and Francesca Da Rimini), both times before live audiences at the orchestra’s home of Avery Fisher Hall (but with the almost undoubtedly vociferous applause left off).  The intensity in Bernstein, even with his advancing age and his slower tempos, never flagged in his final years; and that is borne out in this Tchaikovsky recording, one that should not be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7CN22SW9K20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GCB#wasThisHelpful","R3R7CN22SW9K20","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The old saw about Leonard Bernstein is that, from the energetic dynamo that he was during his official term from 1958 to 1971 as music director of the New York Philharmonic, as he got older, his conducting style and tempo got to be more and more eccentric, arguably more over the top, and also arguably far slower, especially towards the end of his life, when the vast majority of his recordings were being done for Deutsche Grammophon.All of those arguments have validity, but they don’t tell the whole story.  In particular, they don’t tell all that much about how Bernstein, the man known for championing composers like his fellow countryman Aaron Copland, and Gustav Mahler, handled the final three symphonies of Russia’s greatest composer Tchaikovsky during the last five years of his life.This particular recording, of the composer’s Fourth Symphony and the nightmarish symphonic fantasy “Francesca Da Rimini” is a case in point.  The opening movement of the F Minor symphony is very elongated (out to just over twenty-one minutes), not to mention emotionally overwhelming, with the typically huge orchestration (floor-rattling timpani and cymbal crashes) the composer is known for; while the slow movement that follows, though far less intense in volume, is about as tragic as any single symphonic movement ever composed by anybody.  The third movement, of course, is primarily a pizzicato string affair (though with some brass underpinnings); while the fourth movement opens with a huge cymbal crash and ends with what seems to be a triumphant finish (though “seems” is the operative word here when we’re dealing with Tchaikovsky).In the meantime, “Francesca Da Rimini”, drawn from the fifth canto of Dante’s Inferno, is probably as close to an approximation of Hell as I think most people want to get; and with orchestration so large it even puts Wagner and Mahler to shame, Tchaikovsky paints a fiery portrait of Francesca and her lover Paolo being stabbed to death by the jealous hunchback Rimini and forced to spin forever in infernal whirlwinds.  For all that people say about Bernstein’s conducting slowing down as he approached his final years, he gets every last ounce of this work in a way almost no other conductor ever could.  This particular performance of “Francesca Da Rimini” is about as extreme a performance as there has ever been of any single work in the history of recorded classical music, bar none.  But an extreme work like “Francesca Da Rimini” requires an extreme performance, and Bernstein delivered it big time.Both these works, recorded live at Avery Fisher Hall (though the applause, which was undoubtedly quite vociferous, was left out) in October 1989, are given enormously powerful interpretations by Bernstein and his former orchestra (in what may have been the very last pairing between them before Bernstein’s death the following year).  This recording is not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TH9BYGSTT2RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GD7#wasThisHelpful","R2TH9BYGSTT2RD","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disney, with only a handful of notable exceptions, (THE BLACK HOLE; 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and WALL-E chief among them), has not really gone whole hog into the science fiction genre all that much in its history.  But with the 60th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim (an event that took place in July 1955) in mind, they went ahead and made TOMORROWLAND, a cinematic, special effects-laden expansion of what is perhaps the most popular section of that park.In doing this kind of film, which asks us to imagine and subsequently make a better world out of one that seems rapidly heading towards apocalypse, the film’s director Brad Bird (RATATOUILLE; MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL) has taken what must seem like a radical approach for what we normally think of as “Disney fare.”  In it, George Clooney portrays a cynical grumpy inventor whose idea of a jet pack, which he built when he was a kid, bombed at the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York, who encounters an extremely inquisitive and adamantly optimistic teen (Britt Robertson), and subsequently takes her and a robot child named Athena (newcomer Raffey Cassidy) on a journey to change a future that is rapidly going downhill in all the many ways people in the late 20th century had warned about.  The subsequent journey is filled with a lot of peril, some of it fairly hair-raising (even for a ‘PG’-rated Disney film), and a lot of twists, turns, and ponderings of space-time continuum that we saw in the 2014 sci-fi epic INTERSTELLAR, and which would make visionaries like Arthur C. Clarke, Rod Serling, and Ray Bradbury beam with pride in the Great Beyond they occupy.  Hugh Laurie, known for his extremely caustic role on the Fox hit show “House M.D.”, portrays the sinister Nix, who nevertheless gives the admonishment that a bleak future is always preventable…if there were only more young people like Robertson (and her NASA engineer father, played by country music star Tim McGraw) to make it happen.The lengths that this movie goes are so outside of what we think of as traditional Disney convention.  Occasionally, it is a touch preachy, but nevertheless very fantastic, and willing to bend the Disney narrative for the sake of futuristic cinematic storytelling that might otherwise have been left to a Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg.  Bird, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Damon Lindelof (the two also co-authored the story with Jeff Jensen), really does a great deal of mixing science fiction and fantasy with typical Disney charm.  In short, even if TOMORROWLAND is in some ways a plug for its flagship theme park on its 60th anniversary, it doesn’t flag too much during its 130 minute running time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z0NCD3TC5VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2DPYQ6#wasThisHelpful","R10Z0NCD3TC5VZ","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without question, Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the pre-eminent composers of the 20th century, often forced to compose works that reflected the dictates of a bunch of tin ears in the Kremlin and the Politburo in his native Soviet Union.  But the man knew his way around musical irony, which is clearly reflected in the fifteen symphonies that he wrote over a period of just slightly under half a century, beginning with his first in 1925.  And while those works were so blatantly misunderstood and misread by the elitists in his own land, they found favor on our side of the Iron Curtain because Shostakovich had conducting friends in high places, especially here in America.This is true of the composer's fifteenth and final symphony, composed in a shockingly short span of time in the summer of 1971.  Typically large in terms of orchestral size, and moderate in terms of length (45-50 minutes), it is a work full of the composer's trademark originality and irony, though it also pays witty homages to some of his own past works, and alludes to such things as Rossini's famous William Tell Overture, and the ""Fate"" motif of Richard Wagner's famous (or infamous, depending on how one feels about him) Ring cycle.  His own son Maxim gave the work its world premiere recording in early 1972 with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra.But on our shores, the composer entrusted this symphony (and the two that came before it) to one conductor, Eugene Ormandy, and to one orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, to give it its Western premiere.  Ormandy was always an active proponent of Shostakovich's works; and this recording of the 15th Symphony, made in October 1972, is proof of that.  It captures the composer's black wit in a way we'd expect all the great recordings of Shostakovich to do.  The work's greatness shines through, as do Ormandy and the fabulous Philadelphians.While we have had many fine recordings of this very modernistic work since this one (notably Bernard Haitink's 1978 recording with the London Philharmonic), the Ormandy/Philadelphia one is still really the one that sets the standard, and it should be sought after without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL4X36K7N446/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057LSUWC#wasThisHelpful","R2CL4X36K7N446","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Crichton, who passed away in the fall of 2008, may not have realized the kind of goldmine he struck when he published his dinosaur novel ""Jurassic Park"" in 1990; but with director Steven Spielberg's help, that goldmine was open for business with the original 1993 film version, and then with its 1997 sequel THE LOST WORLD.  Due to Spielberg being heavily involved in making A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE in 2001, the third ""Jurassic Park"" film was left in the hands of director Joe Johnston, with Spielberg staying on as executive producer.  Incredibly enough, another fourteen years would pass until the move-going public got the fourth in the series, JURASSIC WORLD.Twenty-two years after John Hammond's experiment at producing an innovative theme part with genetically-created dinosaurs on an island some 200 miles off of Costa Rica came crashing down with the dinosaurs consuming several people, now that same island, Isla Nublar, is now home to Jurassic World, a highly innovative theme park with bigger and better dinosaurs, and, hopefully, with greater controls.  One of the workers, an ex-Navy seaman (Chris Pratt), has become especially attuned to a number of the raptors in the park, and has managed to earn their trust.  At the same time, the park's principal supervisor (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been overseeing the creation of a super-dinosaur, made up of the DNA of the previous species of dinosaurs, including velociraptors, and tyrannosaurus rexes, that has guaranteed an up tick in revenue and park attendance.  But as with anything involving the technology used in creating creatures that have been extinct from the Earth's surface for sixty-five million years, soon everything turns upside down.  This doesn't stop the park's main security chief (Vincent D'Onofrio) from seeing a way to use these dinosaurs as a weapon of war, over the vehement objections of both Pratt and Howard, as well as one of the original scientists (B.D. Wong) from the original Jurassic Park.  Upping the ante still further are the fact that Howard's two nephews (Nick Robinson; Ty Simpkins) have come to the island to be with their aunt; instead, they find themselves having to behave like responsible adults in the most horrible way possible when the mayhem created by the ""super-dinosaur"" allows all the other species out of their enclosures.  When D'Onofrio's megalomaniacal ambitions result in his death, it is up to Pratt and Howard to destroy the super dinosaur with all the weapons at their disposal.As with JURASSIC PARK III, Spielberg's involvement in directing another film (in this case the Cold War II spy thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES) led him to taking the role of executive producer, allowing Colin Treverrow, whose only feature film credit before this was the romantic comedy drama SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED in 2012, to direct it.  With help from co-writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connally, however, Treverrow managed to cobble together elements of the first three films into a coherent, if not necessarily letter-perfect, science fiction/suspense thriller that, in some interesting twists, pays homage not only two its three predecessors, but also to Spielberg's 1975 classic JAWS (as the super-dinosaur eats a Great White shark to the amazement of the 20,000+ people in attendance), and to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS (as the avian dinosaurs attack the park visitors from the air with sometimes bloody results).It is not a mark against either the film or Treverrow to say that the film misses the verve and panache of the first two movies that were directed by Spielberg in masterful fashion, though one sometimes wishes he had concentrated as much on characters as he did on the mayhem.  Nevertheless, Pratt (ZERO DARK THIRTY; GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and Howard (LADY IN THE WATER) do really good turns as a pair, despite the rather clichéd bickering they do at the start; and Robinson and Simpkins make for as appealing a pair of kids as Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards did in Spielberg's original.  Michael Giacchino's score is impressive as well, and he wisely interpolates John Williams' themes from Spielberg's first two films while also incorporating some of his own ideas.The final verdict when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD is that, despite its tendency to fall into predictability in terms of the dinosaur attacks and some cardboard characters, it is far better than most summer CGI film fare, with enough Spielberg influence to keep it from being just another blockbuster.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7ZPXIGC9FI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC5II0#wasThisHelpful","RP7ZPXIGC9FI0","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been known for decades that, of all the major cities in the United States that are vulnerable to massive earthquakes, both Los Angeles and San Francisco rank at the very top. Not only are there many fault lines running underneath each city and its outlying metropolitan areas, but there's also what is arguably the most notorious fault line on the planet, the dreaded San Andreas Fault. Scientists have said that a major quake usually occurs along this fault line every one hundred fifty years; and in the year 2015, that time is severely overdue; and while there have been significant quakes in that period, they've occurred on rift zones other than the 800 mile-long San Andreas, which runs all the way from Eureka southeast to the Mexican border. But in the 2015 sci-fi/disaster opus SAN ANDREAS, California's time has run out.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson portrays an L.A. Fire Department chopper pilot who is expert at saving people's lives, but who wasn't able to save one of his daughters during a whitewater rafting trip that turned tragic; and soon his life is turned upside down when his wife (Carla Gugino) serves him with divorce papers. In the meantime, over at the seismological lab at Caltech in Pasadena, the school's chief seismologist (Paul Giamatti) has detected ground pulses in southern Nevada, which unfortunately start a chain of horrific ground events, beginning with a massive quake destroying Hoover Dam. Yet this is only the beginning; to him, it indicates a possible chain reaction on the San Andreas Fault Zone on the 400-mile stretch between L.A. and San Francisco. Sure enough, his predictions come true with extreme consequences, as all of California is hit with a swarm of quakes in the 7.5 to 9.5 magnitude range along the infamous fault line, with Los Angeles and its surrounding environs being hit first. Johnson is thus forced into action to rescue Gugino from a crumbling high rise in Downtown Los Angeles; and with the knowledge that his only surviving daughter (Alexandra Daddrio) is up in San Francisco, he and Gugino must outrace the continuous destruction to get her.Without question, like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters that rely so heavily on CGI, SAN ANDREAS suffers at times from plausibility issues, as real-life Caltech seismologists Lucy Jones and Kate Hutton pointed out. There is only minimal scientific evidence that ground pulses of the type mentioned here could trigger seismic events on any other fault lines, let alone a monstrous catastrophe along the San Andreas Rift Zone. Still, in terms of certain important rescue and destruction scenarios, like many older buildings collapsing with nightmarish results, SAN ANDREAS does things right, especially with the presence of Johnson playing an Everyman type of hero.Though it shares its scenario with two other important films of this type (1974's EARTHQUAKE, and the 1990 made-for-TV film THE BIG ONE: THE GREAT LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE), SAN ANDREAS also borrows liberally from more recent high-octane sci-fi/disaster films like 1998's DEEP IMPACT, 2004's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and, perhaps most especially, the 2009 end-of-the world spectacle ""2012."" But while director Brad Peyton is not in the human-interest category of a Steven Spielberg, he is still able to get the best out of his six main cast members, who are not stereotypical cardboard clichés, even with a script and storyline with plausibility problems. Several moments in the film, like the rescue of Daddrio from a San Francisco high rise swamped by the tsunami, are quite frightening. In the end, SAN ANDREAS, whatever gaps there are between illusion and reality, does serve up the goods in true Hollywood fashion. But it also warns that the people in both Los Angeles and San Francisco are at risk from The Big One now more than ever before. For those reasons, I am willing to forgive its occasional ""faults"" (pardon the pun).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFW71CCMGG8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGO1FQE#wasThisHelpful","R3JFW71CCMGG8I","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most heavy-duty symphonies in the active concert repertoire, requiring between seventy-five and eighty minutes on the average to perform, the Seventh Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich, known as the ""Leningrad"", is also one of the darkest and grimmest works in the repertoire, outside of Mahler or Tchaikovsky.  Composed around 1939 and 1940, as the composer's native country was becoming embroiled in World War II, it was a work he had originally dedicated to the first leader of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin; instead, however, he dedicated it to the city of Leningrad (known today, and before the 1917 Communist uprising, as St. Petersburg), which endured a 900 day-long siege in which half a million of its own citizens were killed, some of them in orgies of cannibalism because of extreme starvation.  That horror is reflected in this work, but in the end it was a triumphant work for the composer, even though his conflicts with the tin-eared Stalin and the Soviet state apparatus were even then becoming legendary.From the very start, despite the sentiment it held on either side of the Iron Curtain as a bulwark against Hitler's tyranny (as well as Stalin's, to the ears of the more artistically inclined in the West), its extreme length, irony, and emotionalism have made it a challenging work to program among many orchestras in the West, although impressive recordings abound (Leonard Bernstein's 1962 recording with his New York Philharmonic being one; and Bernard Haitink's 1980 version with the London Philharmonic being another)  And, in one of the final recordings that he made before dying tragically in a plane crash in 1993, the Mexican-born Eduardo Mata made this recording of this gigantic Russian masterwork with the orchestra he had elevated to national prominence beginning in 1977, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.While many would argue that Mata and his Dallas orchestra bit off far more than they could possibly chew when it came to the Leningrad symphony, in light of the classic recordings that came before, I would argue that this recording, despite some minor flaws, can stand up to close scrutiny.  The performance is naturally quite huge, and proved to be a fitting, albeit a tragic, memoriam to Mata's sixteen years at the helm of the orchestra (he would be succeeded by Andrew Litton, who would carry on the tradition).Sure, it's not quite on par with Lenny's, but the Mata/Dallas Shostakovich 7 still deserves to be considered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRUXMWO7JRZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001Q99#wasThisHelpful","R1RRUXMWO7JRZV","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many composers' works often reflect the music of their own native soil, as with Dvorak's and Smetana's Czech/Bohemian roots, and Vaughan Williams' works influenced by the folk music of his native England.  And that holds true for Jean Sibelius, the greatest composer that the nation of Finland has ever produced.  Besides such hugely popular single-movement orchestral works like ""Finlandia"" (his nation's anthem in all but actuality), ""Valse Triste"", and ""Tapiola"", Sibelius managed to also compose seven austere symphonies that reflect both the wonder and, sometimes, even the icy terror of his native homeland.  It is the first and last of these symphonies that are placed on this recording by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and their Conductor Laureate, Herbert Blomstedt.Although the second (in D Major) and fifth (in E Flat Major) are generally considered the most popular and recognized of the seven, that doesn't mean the others are merely chopped liver.  The First Symphony, composed and first heard in 1899, gives one the idea of where Sibelius' creative genius lies, in sizeable orchestral ideas painting his nation's icy beauty, with elements of both Dvorak's New World Symphony and Brahms' 4th (both of which are also in this symphony's home key of E Minor); while the Seventh, composed in 1925 and in C Major, is noted for being a single-movement work encapsulating the normal four-movement symphonic form into an uninterrupted form.  Much of this can be tricky to maneuver through.But much in the way that the late Sir Colin Davis did with the Boston Symphony in the 1970s, and Lorin Maazel with the Pittsburgh Symphony in the late 1980s, Blomstedt and the San Francisco Symphony commit themselves most spectacularly in these works, bringing out their inherent drama and icy beauty without making them sound too cold and grim.  Part of a great Sibelius cycle that Blomstedt and the SFSO did for London/Decca during Blomstedt's decade-long tenure in the Bay Area, this is without question one of the great Sibelius symphony recordings of all times, and is well worth owning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMA9K0V1NIIH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000250K6#wasThisHelpful","RMA9K0V1NIIH7","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They are two works that are linked by more than just who composed them: the Choral Fantasy for piano, orchestra, and chorus, composed and first performed in 1808; and the Ninth Symphony, composed between 1817 and 1823, and premiered in May 1824.  The Choral Fantasy begins as a fantastic display of piano virtuosity in the portentous key of C Minor, develops into an elaborate mini piano concerto whose principal melody is vaguely familiar, and then utilizes that orchestral melody for the choral setting of a poem by Christoph Kuffner in the triumphant key of C Major.And of course, not much more need be said of the Ninth Symphony, which for all intents and purposes is probably the most forward-looking of any symphony in the concert repertoire, from its portentous opening measures to its thunderously triumphant finale and the Ode To Joy.Two interconnected works by Beethoven.  But when, and how often, have audiences been able to hear both works side-by-side in the same concert?Fortunately, that managed not only to happen, but the end result was actually recorded, at Avery Fisher Hall on the night of February 2, 1983, when the New York Philharmonic, under their then music director Zubin Mehta, programmed both works, and got some heavy hitters to support.  This 2-record set of the concert (given that the Choral Fantasy usually takes twenty minutes; while the Ninth Symphony is close to 70 minutes in length) features Emanuel Ax, then ascending to becoming one of the great American pianists of modern times, handling Beethoven's challenging keyboard passages in the Fantasy, while Dame Margaret Price, the legendary Marilyn Horne, Jon Vickers and Matti Salminen are the vocal soloists in the Ninth's famous ""Ode To Joy"".  In both works, the New York Choral Artists are featured, under the direction of Joseph Flumemrfelt (who also was known for leading the Westminster Choir).  And one can't forget Mehta's and the New York Philharmonic's considerable contributions.RCA, which originally released the set back in 1983 (it is now run by Sony), would be well advised to re-release this pairing on a 2-CD set.  All the same, however, the combination is well recorded in this classic vinyl set, and it can be considered a desired recording because of the relative infrequency of hearing both works in the same concert.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9TMTRBRM3GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PO92LW#wasThisHelpful","R2J9TMTRBRM3GJ","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mozart excelled at every form of classical music that he laid his hands on, whether that was operas, symphonies, or serenades.  But one form where he truly set the standard for all of those who would follow in his footsteps (including Beethoven and Chopin) is in the form of the piano concerto.  With seemingly inexhaustible ease, the young tyro from Salzburg elevated the piano concerto in Zen-like fashion, composing twenty-seven such examples during his incredibly short time.  Many of them, particularly the final eight (nos. 20-27) set the gold standard in the form.  Two excellent examples of W.A. Mozart's genius un the piano concerto are in form on this CD.Dame Mitsuko Uchida made an absolutely superlative cycle of Mozart's concertos for Philips in the 1980s with Jeffrey Tate and the English Chamber Orchestra that demonstrated why she is one of the great pianists of the world in the last forty years.  On this CD, Uchida and Tate take on two concertos, nos. 18 and 19, that were written in the same year (1784) that Mozart collaborated with Lorenzo DaPonte on their hugely successful opera ""The Marriage Of Figaro.""  The 18th concerto, in B Flat Major, is a wonderful example of Mozart's virtuosity with a touch of lightness, the two outer movements in the home key bracketing a typical Mozartean Andante in the key of G Minor.  The 19th, in F Major, is also a fairly light (but no less profound) work that has foreshadowing of the pianism demonstrated in the eight that would follow, and the composer's way with slow concerto movements (in this case, an Adagio in the key of C Major).  Neither of these concertos is martial in nature, hence the absence of trumpets and timpani.As with the other concertos, these two works are well served by Uchida and Tate; and the English Chamber Orchestra, an orchestra with an extensive history as regards to Mozart, are clearly on their ""A"" game here.  Whether a part of the entire box set made by these forces, or in this individual CD, these are performances well worth having.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSUMWQJFS8ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E3UW#wasThisHelpful","R3KSUMWQJFS8ZC","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some of our nation's smaller orchestras have been able to do well by exposing audiences and listeners alike to many works that aren't as well ensconced in the public imagination as others are.  This is very true in this particular recording by conductor Donald Barra and the San Diego Chamber Orchestra.It is lesser know works by two great Spanish composers of the 20th century that are on this recording, made at Torrey Pines Christian Church in La Jolla in the spring of 1992.  First up is Joaquin Turina, who is well represented here by two small but enlightening works that highlight the orchestra's string section: the ""Rapsodia Sinfonica"" for piano and strings, featuring Gustavo Romero at the piano; and one of Turina's best known and most loved works, ""La Oracion Del Torero"" (The Bullfighter's Prayer), also for string orchestra.The other composer is Joaquin Rodrigo, best known for his works for classical guitar such as the ultra-popular ""Concierto De Aranjuez"" (despite the fact that not only did he not know how to play guitar, but was also blind), but here are featured three pieces that reflect other aspects of his native Spain.  ""Cuatro Madrigales Amatorios"" (Four Love Songs) is a beautiful four-song cycle based in the traditions of Rodrigo's native Andalusian region, and is scored for soprano and chamber orchestra.  Ruth Golden is the soprano soloist in this case, and she acquits herself quite well.  The other two works by Rodrigo, ""Tres Viejos Aires De Danza"" and ""Zarabanda Lejana Y Villancico"" invoke a modernistic approach to older musical forms, both from Spain and Europe, though on a somewhat smaller scale than, say, Ottorino Respighi's more colorful Ancient Airs And Dances.As the classical CD market is not flooded with recordings of these works, this particular recording is a good way to get acquainted with them.  But more than that, the San Diego Chamber Orchestra and Mr. Barra do a wonderful job of unearthing these lesser-known 20th century Spanish treasures.  It is a CD well worth owning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJ4923M8ZTJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001SFN#wasThisHelpful","R2VJ4923M8ZTJ7","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although he was born in India, Zubin Mehta was very well trained in the Vienna school of music in his rise to becoming a conductor, whether it was during the short stint he had as the Montreal Symphony Orchestra's music director in the 1960s, or his tenure at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra that put that orchestra and that city on the classical music map forever, or his lifetime appointment and music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.  One conductor he certainly specialized in as much as any was Richard Strauss.And one work that had become a house specialty of his was the composer's Nietzschean-inspired symphonic tone poem ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"", a work that was always a sonic spectacular on record, but which really took off in the concert hall after its opening ""Dawn"" passage was used to exceptionally cagey effect by director Stanley Kubrick in his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Indeed, in that same year that ""2001"" made the work so insanely popular, Mehta gave it one of its all-time greatest performances in a recording that he made with the L.A. Philharmonic.  Eleven years later, in late 1979, into his second season as the New York Philharmonic's music director, he revisited the gigantic orchestral palette and existential world of that work.The difficult challenge that any conductor, no matter how good, has in doing this work is in sustaining interest in this work beyond its exceptionally portentous opening with its three-note C-G-C motif (the so-called ""World Riddle Theme""), because it does become a deceptive and enigmatic work from that point on.  That famous ""World Riddle"", however, is a motif used at various points throughout; and Mehta has the New York Philharmonic on its toes throughout the work's 34 minute running time.  Although I think his earlier 1968 recording for London/Decca (made at UCLA's Royce Hall) is sonically the better recording to this CBS recording from Avery Fisher Hall, it isn't exactly a slouch either.  And Mehta is truly one of the great conductors of all time because of exploring such a challenging work.  This is a fine recording to have, even if you have many ""Zarathustra"" performances (including the aforementioned 1968 one) in your record/CD collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZT8W1CMV7IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COB8GE0#wasThisHelpful","R1JZT8W1CMV7IS","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One would have thought that everything that needed to be said about director Sam Peckinpah's dark and troubled 1973 Western masterpiece PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID had been said in the many books about this most maverick and ornery of Hollywood directors, plus the 2005 Special Edition DVD release.  But there is quite a bit more; and in fact, Paul Seydor, whose book ""Peckinpah: The Western Films--A Reconsideration"" is one of the touchstone books on Peckinpah's cantankerous but never-a-dull-moment career, has focused in on that film specifically for his book ""The Authentic Death And Contentious Afterlife Of `Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid'""This book not only details the film itself, but its antecedents--the very legend of Garrett and Billy (with its myriad interpretations and contradictions); and the screenplay adaptation that Peckinpah wrote early on in his career (in 1957) of Charles Neider's book ""The Authentic Death Of Hendry Jones"" that was loosely based on that legend (but which, once it reached the screen in 1961 as ONE-EYED JACKS, did not feature his name in the credits).  Seydor then proceeds on to how Peckinpah eventually got the original screenplay by Rudolph Wurlitzer that would form the basis for his film; and then things get even more interesting.Much has been made about the fact that PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, owing to problems involving the camera equipment (a bent lens flange on one camera that caused any shots using that camera to be out of focus), an epidemic of influenza that overtook everyone on the set in Durango, Mexico, and Peckinpah's conflicts with MGM (the studio financing the film) that were worse than any he had ever experienced in his enormously stormy career.  All of this is enhanced by new information that Seydor uncovered through the kind of meticulous research that one needs for this director.  But it's what happened in the post-production process, accelerated by the film going significantly over budget and schedule, that we see just how much of a torture it was for all involved, including the principal film editors Garth Craven, Roger Spottiswoode, and Robert Wolfe.  Owing to a three-prong combination of booze, paranoia, and the after-effects of the flu he had suffered while on location in Durango, Peckinpah was falling dangerously asleep at the switch just when this film, easily the darkest and most tragic of all Westerns (and arguably the best the genre offered in the 1970s), really needed him the most.  Its prestige has risen considerably since its truncated release (poor reviews, mediocre box office, and all) in 1973.  But the 2005 Special Edition release also caused its own problems, with many Internet reviewers severely taking Seydor to task for allegedly ""altering"" the film.  As Seydor points out in the book, he didn't do all that much to it, as everything in it was shot by Peckinpah and edited by his regular crew; and as he also points out, Peckinpah never actually even finished the film because of all the problems he had, many of them, let's be truthful about this, caused directly by his own hand.  He left the film in an unfortunately unfinished shape.All of this points out what an enormous tragedy Hollywood filmmaking can frequently be, especially if the director is as much of a ""troublemaker"" (at least in the eyes of the moneymen) as Peckinpah was.  But Seydor, in this excellent book of his, nevertheless makes a clear and convincing case for PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, even with the problematic elements in its execution and all the troubles involved in its actual making, being one of Peckinpah's best, approaching the stature of THE WILD BUNCH.  For anyone fiercely interested in filmmaking in general, and this director in particular, Seydor's singular, hard-hitting, but still hugely sympathetic look at PAT GARRETT is absolutely essential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J5AA3L0QCG5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810130564#wasThisHelpful","R2J5AA3L0QCG5K","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the very moment it saw its first light of day in 1919, British composer Gustav Holst's monumental seven-movement, astrologically-inspired suite for large orchestra, ""The Planets"", has been a worldwide mainstay, and not just in straight-ahead classical music circles.  Holst's concept of the seven known planets in out Solar System (Pluto not being discovered until 1934) has clearly informed many a science fiction and space opera film score, whether it's the opening ""Mars"" sequence influencing John Williams' thinking of the STAR WARS films, or the isolated, distant combinations of celesta, woodwinds, and wordless female chorus on the work's final movement ""Neptune"" that influenced Jerry Goldsmith's score for STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, or David Shire's on ""2010"".There's no question that it is an orchestral showpiece to end all orchestral showpieces, with an orchestral component that would have made both Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler green with envy.  Orchestras the world over have performed this work ever since its premiere; but the number of recordings of it just exploded with the advent of the space race, and, of course, with the outer space film scores that were clearly influenced by it.  This particular recording, made in 1973, is a prime example of just how influential ""The Planets"" was.  Andre Previn, having first come from a jazz and Hollywood film music background, had developed a solid taste for the English classical music of the late 19th and 20th centuries (Elgar; Vaughan-Williams; Walton) during his tenure as the music director of the London Symphony in the 1970s; and as such, there was no way he could have avoided putting his own stamp on it.  He brings an extremely violent energy to ""Mars"", a joyous approach to ""Jupiter, The Bringer Of Jollity"" (naturally), and a serene isolationism to ""Neptune, The Mystic.""  It also doesn't hurt that the orchestra itself pretty much had had this work in its blood from the beginning, but they are never for one moment on autopilot, since Previn had proven himself to be one of the foremost conductors of his time.  The final movement features the wordless women's voices of the Ambrosian Singers.This sonic free-for-all has had an infinite number of recordings over the years, and my favorites have been: Zubin Mehta's 1971 recording with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Eugene Ormandy's 1975 recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra; and Mehta's later 1989 New York Philharmonic one.  This recording by Previn and the London Symphony is, in my opinion, very much worth standing comparison with those, and it's one you can't go wrong if you want a true interstellar orchestral experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ANIQXWG9VEYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002RNA#wasThisHelpful","R2ANIQXWG9VEYO","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless one counts his First Symphony (the ""Titan""), then it is the Fourth Symphony that is the most popular of the nine symphonies of Gustav Mahler.  Mahler's symphonic visions were often very large in orchestration, and, in the case of nos. 2, 3, 8, & 9, enormously long (each takes 85-100 minutes to perform).  But the Fourth, although close to an hour in length itself, is the one closest to the traditional classical structures of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, dispensing with trombones and tuba, but including sleigh bells.This work, which Mahler composed during 1899 and 1900, but which had to wait until the fall of 1901 for its first performance in Munich, owes a fair amount of its existence, like its three predecessors, to the song collection ""Des Knaben Wunderhorn.""  As such, it is a light work of sorts as well, with its fourth movement, a setting of the Wunderhorn song ""We Enjoy Heaven's Delights"" (intended initially as the seventh movement of the already-gargantuan Third Symphony, before Mahler thought better), for soprano and orchestra.  In the case of this early 1980s Philips recording, it is the great English soprano Dame Margaret Price; and the orchestra in question is the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Edo De Waart.Price, De Waart, and the S.F.S.O. bring out the best in this work, in the manner of many other recordings of this work (Judith Raskin/George Szell; 1965) (Barbara Hendricks/Esa-Pekka Salonen; 1992) (Dawn Upshaw/Christoph von Dohnanyi; 1992).  As with a lot of Mahler's works, even one as light as this, the Fourth is not by any stretch of the imagination an easy work to pull off; it can sometimes slip into schmaltz, or be done in a ham-handed fashion.  Fortunately, the best recordings of it avoid falling into either trap.  And this recording is clearly among the best of the bunch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S165ZSHII3A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LZFP82#wasThisHelpful","R1S165ZSHII3A5","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The novels of Donald Westlake (writing as Richard Stark) have really provided a lot of grist for the Hollywood mill since the 1960s.  The first example was the 1967 John Boorman-directed film POINT BLANK, with Lee Marvin, based on Westlake's book ""The Hunter"", and now considered a cult classic.  After that came 1972's THE HOT ROCK (with George Segal and Robert Redford), 1974's THE OUTFIT (with Robert Duvall and Robert Ryan); and 1974's BANK SHOT (with George C. Scott).And in 1968, there was THE SPLIT.Based on Westlake's book ""The Seventh"", the film is a classically themed Hollywood heist film, involving a group of thieves robbing the cash office at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during a playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Atlanta Falcons. Former NFL legend Jim Brown, who turned to acting after retiring from the Cleveland Browns in 1965 and became a star in Robert Aldrich's 1967 classic THE DIRTY DOZEN, is the leader of this group that includes his fellow DIRTY DOZEN cast members Donald Sutherland and Ernest Borgnine; Jack Klugman (one of the jurors in the 1957 classic TWELVE ANGRY MEN); and veteran character actor Warren Oates. The heist goes off with almost laser-like perfection, but it's what happens thereafter--the complications; the screw-ups; and the betrayals--that are the real payoff. Gene Hackman, who had at the time recently leaped to acting prominence as a result of his role in BONNIE AND CLYDE, portrays a seedy Los Angeles cop (perhaps presaging his Oscar-winning turn in THE FRENCH CONNECTION); and Diahann Carroll and Julie Harris are the women involved. James Whitmore plays a superbly seedy landlord at Carroll's apartment.By 21st century standards, this must seem terribly old-fashioned: there are no hyper-violent, over-the-top stunts, no CGI bloodshed, or any of that extraneous junk. And this is clearly a film of the late 1960s, in terms of costumes, hairstyles, and all of that--this and, of course, the fact that the Rams were L.A.'s pro-football team too. And yet, even though it doesn't necessarily stand out among the many great crime heist films, from Stanley Kubrick's THE KILLING to Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY, the original 1974 subway thriller THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, or even the 1988 blockbuster DIE HARD, there's still something hugely fascinating about THE SPLIT, in terms of the way suspense is built up. Perhaps part of the reason it isn't as well-known as it should be is that the director, British-born Gordon Flemyng, was not a known entity, save for a couple of episodes of the classic TV series ""The Avengers"", and the campy 1965 film DR. WHO AND THE DALEKS. All the same, though, the cast still does well under Flemyng's direction, with very good cinematography by Burnett Guffey (who won an Oscar for BONNIE AND CLYDE), and a taut, early action film music score by Quincy Jones, who had done major work on THE PAWNBROKER, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, and IN COLD BLOOD. This was also the first film to be released following the establishment of the movie ratings system by the MPAA where the for-adults 'R' rating was placed, even though it is closer to a 'PG-13' rating by today's ultra-violent standards.Yes, the film is extremely dated; and despite its length of only 90 minutes, it's not an especially super-fast movie.  But given its limitations, it still has much more to it than most action films even today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBOFRLW5BW8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007I1Q4BI#wasThisHelpful","R3BBOFRLW5BW8Y","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without question, Igor Stravinsky, a student of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and an admirer of Tchaikovsky, was one of the most important composers of the 20th century.  Whether it was in neo-classical works like his orchestral suite ""L'Histoire Du Soldat"" or ""Pulcinella"", or innovative works like ""Symphony In C"" and the ""Symphony Of Psalms"", there is no dispute that this great Russian-born composer, who lived from 1883 to 1971, influenced much of 20th century music, even as far as Hollywood film scores, such as those of John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, and Jerry Goldsmith.  And where his genius was most fully exposed was in the field of ballet.This two-CD collection of recordings made by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in the early 1980s for London/Decca under their legendary music director of the time, Antal Dorati, showcases four of Stravinsky's ballet scores in their complete form: the 1911 opus ""Petrushka""; the lighter 1928 ""Apollon Musagete""; and the two ""Big Bangs"" of 20th century music, to wit ""The Firebird"" and ""The Rite Of Spring"".  All four ballet scores require orchestras who perform and/or record them to be on their toes, because Stravinsky's orchestration, besides being very complex and occasionally even dissonant, is also explosive at times, perhaps nowhere more so than in ""The Rite Of Spring"".  Fortunately, both Dorati and the Detroit Symphony were well up to the task in these recordings.  The string section of the orchestra dominates in their recording of the ""Apollon Musagete"" score in a way that combines modernism with the neo-classical style.  ""Petrushka"" also receives a stellar rendition; and no matter how many other orchestras have recorded ""The Firebird"" or ""The Rite Of Spring"" in their complete forms (normally, only the suites that Stravinsky extracted are recorded with extreme frequency), they got performances from Motown that are equal to any other such recordings.The years when Dorati was the Detroit Symphony's music director, from 1977 to 1983 (and Conductor Laureate from 1983 until his passing in 1988), were one of four important ""Golden"" eras for the orchestra, the others being Paul Paray's 1952-1963 tenure (which really put Detroit on the classical map); Neeme Jarvi's from 1990 to 2005 (he is now Conductor Emeritus); and the current one with Leonard Slatkin as the Music Director.  This Stravinsky 2-CD pack should keep people aware of the great classical tradition that flourished in Detroit over the decades, and continues to thrive to this day, even in the midst of all the fiscal horrors that the Motor City has faced these last few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMP91U8DN2EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AFG6RM#wasThisHelpful","R2JMP91U8DN2EM","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it is safe to say that the city of Los Angeles owes a huge debt of gratitude to Zubin Mehta for having put the City of Angels on the classical music map for keeps during his sixteen-year tenure, from 1962 to 1978, as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.  What had largely been a provincial orchestra in 1962, at a rundown Philharmonic Hall, when Mehta took over at the age of 26 became, before the 1960s were even over with, one of the great orchestras in America, and, eventually, the entire world.  A great deal of that was owed to his training in Vienna, but also the realization on his part that the orchestra had some of the best musicians in the world, many of whom worked in Hollywood (which would remain true into our present day).  Thus, he was able to cover not only the hard-core part of the repertoire, but also those works not nearly as well known to the public.  This release, an import from the Japanese division of London/Decca, is just such an example.The best known of the two is Camille Saint-Saens' monumental Symphony No. 3 In C Minor, which, for obvious reasons, in the second and fourth movements, is the Organ Symphony.  This is a work that never fails to test the sound systems of anyone's sound systems, both with respect to the organ and the extremely large orchestral forces required in the finale; but even beyond that, this work, composed by Saint-Saens in 1886, was probably the single most popular symphony to have emerged from France since Berlioz's graphically violent ""Symphonie Fantastique"".  This particular Mehta/L.A. Philharmonic recording, made in March 1970, features Anita Priest at the organ.A little over two years earlier, in the fall of 1967, Mehta and the orchestra made a very impressive recording of another work that calls for an organ (or a harmonium) and a fairly huge orchestral component: the Fourth Symphony of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin, which he called ""Poem Of Ecstasy.""  A work of more recent vintage, composed by Scriabin between 1905 and 1908, it is a fairly modernistic work, full of suspense and tension for its twenty-minute length, and fairly perfect for Mehta and the orchestra.  It probably isn't too much of a stretch to say that Los Angeles audiences, if not indeed the world at large, got to know this work through this performance.Both works are paired quite cagily onto this import record, but the Organ Symphony in particular is given one of its great renderings, right up there with the 1957 Mercury recording made by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray (with Marcel Dupre at the organ) and the later 1983 Philips recording by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under Edo De Waart (with Jean Guillou handling the organ duties).  Either work, though, showcases both the L.A. Philharmonic and the conductor that put it on the map in the first place at their finest, one of the truly great orchestra/music director combines in history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGIZWAISOI2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8XYTWI#wasThisHelpful","R2WGIZWAISOI2J","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot think of another director that ever worked behind a film camera who ever caused the kind of uproar in their lifetime that Sam Peckinpah did during his.  Coming from a pioneer family in central California that had already been active in politics and the law for decades, Peckinpah's true love, however, was the theater; and in the decades to come, that eventually morphed into a great deal of work in TV, including his own short-lived 1960 television western ""The Westerner"", and then finally a film career that, to put it mildly, was a radically turbulent one right up until his untimely death on December 28, 1984, less than two months short of his 60th birthday.One of the best books chronicling this ultimate Hollywood ""outlaw"" is this one, ""Peckinpah: A Portrait In Montage"" by Garner Simmons, who, as a student at Northwestern University in 1973, met the director of such classic but disturbingly violent films as THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS, and was shanghaied into portraying one of the guards of Emilio Fernandez in the director's truly bleak and despairing 1974 film BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA.  Simmons, in very exacting detail, gives a look at all of the aspects of this often controversial director and what went on behind the making of his movies, and the rapid montage style of editing that radically changed the way Hollywood action films are shot and put together.  Of particular interest in reading this chronicle was in reading the battle between the director and producer Jerry Bresler on the 1965 Civil War-era western epic MAJOR DUNDEE, which included the fact that Peckinpah had selected locations in Mexico for that film that were at times hundreds of miles apart, which hurt efforts to get the script, which wasn't even finished at the time shooting had begun in February 1964, into final shape.  Simmons also details Peckinpah's travails after being fired from THE CINCINNATI KID, shortly after DUNDEE, an event which left him all but unhirable in Hollywood for a couple of years.  At the same time, though, we get a solid overview of the making of THE WILD BUNCH, THE BALLAD OF CABLE OF HOGUE, STRAW DOGS, JUNIOR BONNER, THE GETAWAY, and the troubled PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, six incredible pieces of work released within a period of four and a half years, from mid-1969 to the fall of 1973.Inevitably, though, Simmons details Peckinpah's downfall, due not only to his abuse of booze but, worst of all, also to his abuse of cocaine, which often left him in no real shape to do anything the way he had done in the past (as could be witnessed on THE KILLER ELITE, CROSS OF IRON, and CONVOY, despite several moments of brilliance in all).  This revised version of the book then details the brief and minor comeback he had in 1983 with THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND, and then with the heart attack he had in Mexico that sent him back to L.A. and his premature death.Simmons' book is one of three, the others being ""If They Move, Kill `Em: The Life And Times Of Sam Peckinpah"" by David Weddle, and ""Peckinpah: The Western Films--A Reconsideration"" by Paul Seydor, that are the most detailed about Peckinpah's groundbreaking work as a director and the unfortunate demons and dark parts of his being that he often had to wrestle with and which he ultimately lost to.  Nothing is glossed over, but the extensive interviews that Simmons conducted with the director, the actors who starred in his films, and such associates as film editors Roger Spottiwoode, Bob Wolfe, and Lou Lombardo, and legendary composer Jerry Fielding, give a great and even-handed portrait of this extremely complex director who, in spite of all the odds he was up against an old Hollywood system that disintegrated in the 1960s and his own reputation as a wild, out-of-control macho man, somehow managed to, in paraphrasing Joel McCrea's famous line in the director's 1962 classic RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, enter his house justified.Anyone who is interested in great biographies in general, and those in particular that involve Hollywood, should not wait to get this book to get a look at a director whose impact is still being felt some three decades after his death.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7B42ZWIGZXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=087910273X#wasThisHelpful","R1V7B42ZWIGZXS","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What is it about Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"" that has made it so unbelievably popular for almost an entire century?  Given that Holst himself was actually bothered by its initial popularity when it was premiered in 1919, one can't help but wonder.  But once one looks at a number of classic science fiction film scores, notably those of John Williams (STAR WARS; CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) and Jerry Goldsmith (STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE), the influence of this seven-movement work is indisputable.From the violent opening measures of ""Mars The Bringer Of War"", through the peace of ""Venus"", the sprightly ""Mercury"", and finally to the disembodied desolation of ""Neptune The Mystic"" (with its wordless female chorus, a la the ""Sirenes"" movement of Debussy's ""Nocturnes""), ""The Planets"" is one of the ultimate examples of orchestration, requiring orchestral forces so large that it often seems to put even the big-scale works of Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, or Igor Stravinsky in the shade.  But this also often poses a difficulty for conductors who get their hands on this work: How do make a recording of this warhorse truly stand out?This is something that conductor Zubin Mehta grapples with on this Teldec recording of Holst's masterpiece--and doubly so, because this version with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra from 1989 is actually his second go-round with it.  The first one was in 1971 for London/Decca; and on that recording, he had the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the orchestra he really made world famous in his sixteen-year tenure there, at his command.  That particular recording is still considered one of the greatest the work has ever received.Given this, does this New York recording match or exceed it?  Not necessarily, but it does come fairly close.  There's no question that the New York Philharmonic retained the world-class status it had achieved in all of the years that Leonard Bernstein was on the podium under Mehta's 1978-1991 tenure; and the explosive outbursts in ""Mars"" and ""Jupiter"" are well conceived, with some of the same intensity that the L.A. Philharmonic bought to the work in the early 1970s.  The disembodied female voices of the New York Choral Artists in ""Neptune"" provide the brilliant interstellar gravitas to conclude the piece.The market may be saturated with recordings of this warhorse, but that's why it is a warhorse to begin with.  This recording may fall a touch short of what Mehta did in L.A., but it is still a standout one to listen to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQRCU6ZNRYIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009IM6#wasThisHelpful","RNQRCU6ZNRYIB","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unquestionably one of the greatest composers of all times, Johannes Brahms was, however, a man caught in between two musical polarities in the time he composed, the middle-to-later 19th century.  On the one hand, he was, especially in terms of orchestral music, generally deemed a follower of the traditions of the classic Viennese era (Haydn; Mozart; Beethoven; Schubert); on the other hand, he was surrounded by musical ""radicals"" like Liszt, Bruckner, Wagner, and Mahler, who greatly expanded the scope of Western music by enlarging their orchestral works to unbelievable dimensions, thus setting the stage for what would come in the 20th century via Schoenberg and Stravinsky.  Brahms is still thought of as something of a musical conservative, but this hardly means he was ever a merely popular composer.  Such can be gauged here in this recording that combines the inner two of his four symphonies.Composed in the summer of 1877, after his first foray into the symphony took some two decades to finish because of the composer's lingering fears of Beethoven's shadow, the D Major Second Symphony is a work that still carries the influences of Beethoven, mixing the idealism of the Pastoral Symphony and the obvious heroic elements of the Eroica Symphony into what is nevertheless a cohesive and completely original symphonic whole.  Brahms' only concessions to the Romantic era in which he lived were the inclusion of a tuba and three trombones, most prominently at the triumphant climax of the fourth movement.  In an ironic turn, part of the melody of the work's opening movement bears a close similarity to the composer's beloved ""Wiegenlied"", more commonly known as the Cradle Song, or Lullaby.The Third Symphony, composed in 1883, is really more in line with Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, being as it is in the same key, F Major; and it excludes the tuba from the orchestration.  Oddly, it is perhaps the least played of the four symphonic efforts of Brahms, not because of any defect in the way he composed it, but because, in contrast to so many symphonies, all four movements of this work end in relatively quiescence and tranquility.  The finale is particularly notable for starting in the stormy key of F Minor before making its quiet exit in the home key of F Major.Both of these symphonies are given first-rate performances by the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam under their esteemed conductor from 1964-1987, Bernard Haitink; the Third being recorded in May 1970, and the Second in June 1973, as part of a major 1969-1980 Philips survey of the major orchestral works of Brahms that Haitink did with the Concertgebouw.  Neither of these symphonies is taken at too slow a pace, nor are they taken at what I call the ""fire sale speed"" approach of period instrument performers.  Haitink's experience with Brahms is evident in both works, with the Concertgebouw performing like the world-class orchestra it has been for close to a hundred and twenty-five years.If any recording of these two symphonies back-to-back is being considered seriously, this one by the world-class conductor/orchestra of Haitink and the Concertgebouw should be among the first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOCTE0UYCKBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EER59G#wasThisHelpful","RCOCTE0UYCKBJ","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the composers that the late, great British conductor Sir Colin Davis specialized in throughout his career was one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  And during the 1980s, he essayed nearly the entire final third of the composer's symphonic output for Philips in recordings made with the Dresden State Orchestra (Staatskapelle Dresden).  This particular recording of that entire set, incredibly enough, pulls together four of those symphonies, principally since none of them are much longer than twenty minutes.The 30th Symphony is a work that Mozart premiered in Salzburg in May 1774, and it shows the composer rapidly maturing his approach to the symphony.  Some of the elements of it echo the symphonies in the same key (D Major) that his good friend and much older contemporary Franz Joseph Haydn was composing, and the orchestration is starting to get progressively larger.  That would happen to a greater degree with the so-called ""Paris"" Symphony, No. 31, also in D Major, composed four years later after a terribly unsuccessful job-hunting sojourn to the French capitol.  That work had the largest required number of orchestral forces of any Mozart symphony up to that time (it was the first one to utilize clarinets), with trumpets and timpani very much in evidence.The 32nd Symphony (in G Major) s a short eight-minute work consisting of three movements played without a break, but with noticeable changes in tempo (fast-slow-fast), laid out as if it were an Italian overture (indeed, some would say that it was intended as the overture for Mozart's opera ""Zaide"", though this isn't likely); this was composed in 1779, shortly after the composer returned to Salzburg from Paris.  Also from that same year came the 33rd Symphony, in B Flat Major, employing only oboe, bassoon, and horn, along with the string orchestra compliment, making it the lightest scored of the ten symphonies that Mozart had composed, back to No. 24.With the possible exception of the ""Paris"", these symphonies don't necessarily enjoy the kind of recognition of the symphonies yet to be, or even the ""Little G Minor"" (#25), would.  After listening to the way an expert Mozart conductor like Davis, and an orchestra that is historically steeped in the composer's music like the Dresden State Orchestra, you will wonder why that is.  These performances are well worth getting this recording for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNCKAU0CL2OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4V3#wasThisHelpful","R3JNCKAU0CL2OS","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The symphonies of Beethoven are all compelling works to listen to, even those that are not necessarily thought of as ""profound"" statements in the way that word has often been used.  This is the case made by this particular recording, part of the late German conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch's early 1990s Beethoven symphony cycle made for EMI with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.The Fourth Symphony in B Flat Major, composed in 1806 at a time when the increasingly deaf composer was also working on the grandiose statements of the Fifth Symphony and the Violin Concerto, is considered a ""lesser"" work in Beethoven's symphonic canon because it has none of the explosiveness of the two works that it is sandwiched in between; Robert Schumann would later refer to it as ""a slender Greek maiden standing between two Norse giants"" (the Eroica Symphony being its immediate predecessor).  And in truth, it doesn't seem as if it breaks any new ground per se, needing the smallest amount of orchestral forces of any of the symphonies (including just a single flute).  In truth, though, what it might lack in profundity, it does gain in Beethoven showing a lighter side, still partly stuck in the Haydn/Mozart frame, but also anticipating what would be coming in the ensuing ten years from his much younger contemporary Franz Schubert, in its bumptious third movement, a cross between a Minuet and a Scherzo, and a scurrying finale that somewhat anticipates the opening movement of Schubert's Second Symphony.The Seventh, of course, is one of Beethoven's supreme achievements, an experiment in rhythmic vitality.  Wagner himself called it ""the apotheosis of the dance"", with the fierce vitality of the Scherzo and finale.  But there is also the elongated first movement in the work's home key of A Major, its slow intro leading into the dotted, almost Scherzo-like rhythms of the main body; and the darker Allegretto, in A Minor, which found its way into cinematic usage twice in 2009 via THE KING'S SPEECH and KNOWING.Having made a solid Schumann symphony cycle for EMI in 1972 with the Dresden State Orchestra, and having also held down the top artistic positions at the Bavarian State Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra in his time, Sawallisch clearly knew his way around a significant amount of the standard Austro-German repertoire, and it shows on this recording.  The pacing of both the Fourth and Seventh symphonies is right where it has to be, and the Concertgebouw Orchestra is at its world-class peak here for Sawallisch, as it had been for Bernard Haitink, and would continue to be for Riccardo Chailly.  This is a great Beethoven recording to own, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNA9CQKMZ7VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DNR5#wasThisHelpful","R1JNA9CQKMZ7VJ","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without question, when one hears the name Giuseppe Verdi, one thinks of the greatest composers of opera in history--""Aida""; ""Macbeth""; ""Falstaff""; ""La Forza Del Destino""; ""Othello"", and many others.  Beyond opera, of course, there is his Manzoni Requiem, perhaps the best-known setting of the Mass For The Dead after Mozart's, and one of the most apocalyptic works of any kind composed in Western music, period.  But there is another choral work of Verdi's worth exploring...or rather, a collection of four sacred settings that he composed in the final twelve years of his life, and which are grouped under ""Quattro Pezzi Sacri"", or ""Four Sacred Pieces.""  They are: ""Ave Maria"" (which he set in 1889, though he considered it only an exercise piece); ""Stabat Mater"" (from 1886-87); ""Laude Alla Vergine Maria""(1886-88, a setting of the prayer in Canto XXXIII of Dante's ""Paradiso""); and a setting of the ""Te Deum"" composed in 1895-96.In comparison to the Manzoni Requiem, of course, ""Four Sacred Pieces"" is not nearly as frequently recorded; and the fact that, despite the significant size of the orchestra required, it is not anywhere as apocalyptic seems to make it extremely obscure.  But on this singular recording, made in April 1970, Zubin Mehta makes the most of this combination, working in collaboration with legendary mezzo-soprano Yvonne Minton, the Los Angeles Master Chorale (under the direction of their founder, Roger Wagner), and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, which, by that time, under Mehta's direction, was really becoming a serious world powerhouse in classical music.This recording has been combined on CD in recent times with Fritz Reiner's 1959 Vienna Philharmonic recording of the Manzoni Requiem, but it one that deserves to stand another release, this next time with one of the separate recordings Mehta made during his sixteen-year tenure (1962-1978) as the L.A. Philharmonic's music director.  This vinyl recording, in the meantime, can, I believe, be considered the absolutely definitive recording of this rarely recorded and performed choral work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FF00NZHIU9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JK4DX8#wasThisHelpful","R11FF00NZHIU9Z","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where to begin?Given the huge success of director John Carpenter's 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN, it was almost inevitable that its story of teens being stalked (and frequently killed) by a maniac would be exploited by other films.  What nobody anticipated, of course, was to the extremes to which this would happen--not just with a handful of films, but with tens, hundreds, and, by now, perhaps even thousands of them.  And the 1980 film FRIDAY THE 13TH was perhaps the biggest of the HALLOWEEN-inspired imitations.One doesn't have to go into the particulars of the story, because, after three and a half decades, we know what the drill is: the summer camp at Crystal Lake re-opens some twenty years after a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned there due, in no small part, to the neglect of the camp counselors there.  Some things, though, apparently don't change, because, as before, the camp counselors and their teenage underlings engage in all matters of sexual activity; and soon, one by one, they get basically chopped up, skewered, eviscerated, and dismembered in every gory way imaginable for that time, in the manner of what may be this movie's true progenitor, the 1971 Mario Bava film TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE.  As happened in HALLOWEEN with Jamie Lee Curtis, the only one still left standing is the one of them (Adrienne King) who didn't engage in illicit sex.  The irony, though, is that when she encounters what seems to be a kindly old woman (Betsy Palmer), she meets up with the actual assailant, as Palmer is the stark-raving bonkers, vengeance-seeking mother of Jason, resulting in some actual suspense, but also with a climax and coda that would be repeated with variations for almost every other film in the series (only then, it is Jason himself doing the stalk/hack/slash thing).It has to be said that director Sean S. Cunningham, who produced director Wes Craven's controversial 1972 horror cult classic LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, does some inventive things early on, given that he had a budget of just over half a million dollars (which probably wouldn't even cover the catering on most typical Hollywood big-budget films).  A number of the daytime scenes at Camp Crystal Lake have some of the disturbing aura of director John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE (itself something of a horror film).  And there is an early appearance here by Kevin Bacon, basically the only person in the cast who went on to bigger and (needless to say) better things, as one of the teens who, of course, ends up getting butchered.But in general, the whole reason for the existence of FRIDAY THE 13TH, besides to cash in on the success of the relatively blood-free HALLOWEEN, was to show the inventive and extremely graphic ways people can be hacked up, which can be credited to make-up effects wizard Tom Savini, who worked on the 1978 George Romero classic DAWN OF THE DEAD.  This really points out the fact that the very reason for the film's success is that it is also its own Achilles heel, not to mention that the fact that so many of the victims killed here are women, ushering the kind of misogyny that would become a big part of these films from here on in.  In no realistic and unbiased way can FRIDAY THE 13TH be considered a truly classic horror film in the manner of either HALLOWEEN or PSYCHO.  There are things about it that work well enough, but it still falls far short of what came before it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PX4C6LA0IGS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001MXXM#wasThisHelpful","R3PX4C6LA0IGS0","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The difficulty with assessing any Beethoven symphony recording comes with the fact that this composer's nine symphonies, whether as part of a cycle or individually, have been recorded thousands of times already, and are likely to be recorded thousands of times more.  Whether it's with traditional symphony orchestras, smaller chamber orchestras, or those of the period-instrument/authentic performance bent, Beethoven's symphonies are timeless and universal.  Thus, the problem becomes of how to put a new, or even distinctive, ""spin"" on works that most everyone knows so well.This is something that the late German conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch, whose many conducting stints included the Bavarian State Opera in Munich and the Philadelphia Orchestra, contended with in the Beethoven cycle he did for EMI in the early 1990s with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.  This particular recording focuses in on two works that don't necessarily seem like they come from the same creative mind, but do.The First Symphony, which was composed in 1797, was the only one of the nine Beethoven composed that was written while he still had his hearing intact.  It is a work that, understandably, still shows the influences of Mozart's and Haydn's later symphonies, but with a few twists: a slow introduction to the first movement that showcases the wind section of the orchestra in a way that alienated reviewers of Beethoven's time; and a third movement that is marked as a Minuet, but is in fact an embryonic example of the Scherzo, which would come to be an important part of his symphonic language, as well as that of his later contemporary Franz Schubert.The Third Symphony, the all-encompassing Eroica, originally composed in 1803 and dedicated to Napoleon until the latter's delusions of grandeur so savagely inflamed Beethoven, is where Beethoven became his own man.  From its elongated opening movement (the longest symphonic movement up to that time, to be surpassed only by the finale of the Ninth), to the highly-charged Funeral March, the intense Scherzo, and the finale, which is a series of variations on a theme found in the composer's only ballet ""The Creatures Of Prometheus"", this is a work that basically thrust the symphonic form from the 18th century into the 19th, with the first two hammer strokes.Even if there's not much to any of these performances that is absolutely new, again because the works themselves are so familiar to audiences, Sawallisch nevertheless gets a lot of mileage from them, as does the Concertgebouw Orchestra, one of the premier orchestras of the world.  There are other fine pairings of Beethoven 1 & 3 (Leonard Bernstein's with the New York Philharmonic from 1964; Nikolaus Harnoncourt's with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, from the late 1980s; and Herbert Blomstedt's with the San Francisco Symphony from 1990), but this Sawallisch/Concertgebouw recording is well worth consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6PHHUWZ8QJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DNR4#wasThisHelpful","R3K6PHHUWZ8QJE","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absent any hidden gems from the vaults of either Capitol or Warner/Elektra that her fans don't know about, the order of the day when it comes to Linda Ronstadt will be compilations and repackages of her output, since Parkinson's robbed her of that four-octave voice that made her among the most influential female pop singers of the last fifty years.  And it definitely was a glorious career.This is where ICON comes in.Although there will understandably be quite a lot of quibbling over the fact that this compilation from the vaults of Capitol has a mere eleven tracks on it, it does have a number of her most essential songs, including the two songs, ""You're No Good"" and ""When Will I Be Loved"", from her final Capitol album, the career-making 1974 classic HEART LIKE A WHEEL, as well as her first two hits, ""Different Drum"" (her first hit, with the Stone Poneys, in 1967), and ""Long Long Time"", which hit #25 in the fall of 1970 and gave her the first of twenty-seven Grammy nominations.  We also get her rendition of Jackson Browne's ""Rock Me On The Water"", from her eponymous 1972 album, that featured backing from a couple of guys named Glenn Frey, Randy Meisner, and Don Henley (three-fourths of what became the Eagles), and ""An American Dream"", the 1980 hit by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that featured Linda on a kind of hard to miss harmony part.  All of this points out the arena of music where she was at her most influential, the Los Angeles country-rock movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and how much that influence continues on in her fellow female artists, from her good pal Emmylou Harris, through to Trisha Yearwood and Sheryl Crow, and up to more recent roots-rock women like Tift Merritt and Caitlin Rose.ICON concludes with the straight pop balladry of ""Somewhere Out There"", her bit hit duet with R&B singer James Ingram that was the theme to the Steven Spielberg-produced 1986 animated movie AN AMERICAN TAIL, and ""Tell Him I Said Hello"", the opening track of her 2004 jazz album HUMMIN' TO MYSELF, that would, according to Linda, be the very last song she ever put down on an album with just her name on it.  It is a fitting and, at the same time, poignant way to end this compilation album, coming after her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and her receiving a National Medal of Arts.Even though this is a compilation of material that probably every one of her fans has, the songs on it are a reminder of how high a standard Linda set, and how enormous the challenge will be for current media darlings like Taylor Swift to have careers both as long-lasting and memorable as Linda's was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIF0ZFMJ3GRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBU7EIO#wasThisHelpful","R1GIF0ZFMJ3GRD","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when you combine CGI, ""found footage"" video, and the revival of the disaster film craze that enveloped the cinema during the 1970s? This is where INTO THE STORM comes into play.Set during a turbulent spring in the Midwest, the film depicts a professional group of storm chasers, led by Matt Walsh and Sarah Wayne Callies, who thus far have had no luck in getting close to any real tornadoes in the previous two years.  This time, though, their ""luck"" changes when they find an extremely violent cold front is barreling through the midsection of the United States, and conditions are forming for a record formation of tornadoes.  The crew hightail it for the small Oklahoma town of Silverton, where they see monstrous super storm cells starting to form over the open plains on all sides of town.  At the same time, however, the town is also seeing off a lot of its kids for graduation at the high school; and unfortunately, the school, the town, and everybody in it are in the sights of these supercells.  Walsh is so desperate to get the footage on film that he will put himself and those around him at risk, something that truly alienates Callies, an experienced meteorologist, no end.  But instead of just merely filming and documenting the twisters, the team find themselves rescuing many townspeople, including the high school vice-principal (Richard Armitage) and the students when six different twisters touch down and ravage much of the town.  And then in the end, they are confronted with a three mile-wide monster tornado with winds in its center approaching a mind-busting three hundred miles per hour.The entire premise of INTO THE STORM is a good one, given that Midwestern towns like Moore, Oklahoma and Joplin, Missouri were each nearly wiped clean off the map by monstrous tornadoes during the typical season for these storms at the height of spring, when cold, dry air funneling out of Canada collides with the warm, humid air coming northward from the Gulf of Mexico.  If this premise had been followed through with the same kind of care as the creation of the computer-generated twisters had been, what we might have had here was a truly frightening film along the lines of the 1996 Jan DeBont-directed film TWISTER, which this strongly resembles and which it will inevitably be compared to.But even with all that great CGI on display, there are three things that keep INTO THE STORM from reaching the level of TWISTER.  The first is that not enough time is taken to really draw realistic characters out of the main principals involved, though Callies and Carey (the latter as one of the Silverton teens caught up in the super destruction of the town) do good turns.  The second is the excessive use on the part of both director Steven Quale (FINAL DESTINATION 5) and writer John Swetnam (who wrote, among other things, the screenplay for the 2013 horror film EVIDENCE) to rely on the ""found footage"" and high school student ""time capsule"" things, since it blunts the edge the film might have had over other summer blockbusters.  And I really think the film could have done better without the appearance of a couple of extremely irritating and stereotypical redneck wanna-be storm chasers (Kyle David; Jon Reep).Absent the aforementioned flaws, the comparisons to TWISTER, which benefited from good performances by Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, would not seem to be quite as unfavorable as this review appears to be.  Still, INTP THE STORM, when it focuses in on the storm chasers, the townspeople, and the super storms themselves, works with almost the same degree of success as TWISTER.  It is a fairly typical summer blockbuster film, of course, relying, perhaps a bit excessively, on creating spectacular disaster scenes instead of giving us more in the way of characters.  But as many other such blockbusters rely even less, or almost not at all, on things as important as plot and character, INTO THE STORM is far from a total bust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KC78ZUWJWD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJANZNI#wasThisHelpful","R11KC78ZUWJWD8","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"British trumpet player Alison Balsom has become a superstar in the classical music in the last few years.  Her recordings of various and hugely popular trumpet concertos from such composers as Haydn and Hummel, among others, have earned her considerable plaudits, as has her ability to handle both the modern-day trumpet (with keys) and the valveless one of the Baroque and early classical period.  It is the latter one that is put to good use on this 2012 EMI/Warner release in which Ms. Balsom she teams up with conductor Trevor Pinnock and the period instrument orchestra The English Concert.This release focuses in on the royal music (of which a lot was composed) by the two titans of English baroque music, namely native son Henry Purcell, and the German émigré George Frideric Handel.  With assistance from countertenor Iestyn Davies and soprano Lucy Crowe, Balsom weaves her way through these pieces, many of which are not necessarily the best known works of these composers, including suites from Purcell's operas ""King Arthur"" and ""The Fairy Queen"" and the Water Piece In D of Handel, which, if it seems at all familiar (and it should), is a loose arrangement of themes of the composer's D Major Suite from the Water Music collection.  Befitting the royal nature of these works, and the fact that numerous of these pieces are in the very royal key of D Major, it will surprise nobody that the timpani have their place, which is enough to put even 21st century audiences back to the turn of the 18th century.In all honesty, I have to say that I am not ordinarily a fan of too many period instrument performances, because I feel that there are times when, well-intentioned as they are in bringing the works of two or three centuries ago back in what might be conceived as the way they actually sounded back in the day, they feel rushed, as if the performers and the conductor were off to a fire sale they didn't know about.  Here, however, I think an exception has been wisely made, because grandiosity is the order of the day; and Pinnock and his English Concert, who made a huge impact with their recording of the original all-wind version of Handel's Royal Fireworks Music, do a solid job of bringing the grandiosity of these works.  Similarly, Ms. Balsom's trumpet playing, on the valveless natural trumpet of the Handel/Purcell period, is as good as it gets when it comes to period instrument authenticity.Even if you're not normally into such authenticity, this recording is still highly recommended for its ability to put the listener back in time to when royalty was the name of the game in England.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LC0MKQ4ZTL3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ROH07W#wasThisHelpful","R3LC0MKQ4ZTL3M","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is arguably the best film ever made for television, and one of the most terrifying and sweat-inducing movies of any kind every made.  It is DUEL, that superb 1971 masterpiece of suspense directed by a young man from Phoenix, Arizona named Steven Spielberg, concerning an average businessman (Dennis Weaver) being terrorized and stalked along desert highways in Southern California by the unseen but clearly psychopathic driver of a greasy gasoline tanker truck.  It is the ultimate daytime nightmare as brilliantly conceived by veteran science fiction and horror writer Richard Matheson.And now, it is the subject of an entire book--and an excellent book.Writer Steven Awalt looks in thorough and exacting detail at how a story that began with a frightening encounter that Matheson and fellow writer Jerry Sohl had on a canyon road in Ventura County on the day of the JFK assassination with a monstrous-looking rig, and culminated with the airing of DUEL on ABC on the night of November 13, 1971.  Not only does he include the close-in details of the storyboards and the locations (all in the isolated canyon areas that lie between the San Fernando Valley and the western Mojave Desert), but he got interviews from Spielberg, Matheson, Weaver, the film's producer George Eckstein, Billy Goldenberg (who composed the film's nightmarish avant-garde score), and DUEL's first assistant director James Fargo.  In reading this book, alongside a viewing of the film itself, it is remarkable that DUEL went from first frames exposed to airing on ABC in less than ten weeks, which seems extremely incredible nowadays, if not downright ridiculous, even for television.  And everyone moved quite fast to make it happen, on a tight shooting schedule, and a budget that would absolutely not cover the catering on most Hollywood films nowadays.  But the end result was a classic of the suspense thriller genre, and the launching pad of Spielberg's film career, which has continued to flourish well into the 21st century.This book is a thoroughly fascinating look at the making of a great movie, and is well worth getting, especially for true cineastes and Spielberg fanatics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MNOVW2NI1XVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081089260X#wasThisHelpful","R2MNOVW2NI1XVH","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the early 1990s, Irish pianist John O'Conor and the legendary conductor Sir Charles Mackerras made a number of recordings for Telarc, with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, of nine Mozart piano concertos (17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,24, 25, & 27) that, while they may not have necessarily been revelatory, were nevertheless excellently crafted, and among the best that the particular concertos in question had received in their time.  This particular recording is of perhaps best known of all of Mozart's keyboard concertos, and his final one.The C Major concerto, No. 21, is a quintessential work not only in the arena of the piano concerto as Mozart imagined it, but a pivotal work in that entire field.  Framed by lively and energetic outer movements, which make prominent use of trumpets and timpani and allow for pianistic virtuosity, the inner slow movement of this concerto was elevated to ""big hit"" status in 1967, when Swedish director Bo Widerberg utilized it in his romantic movie ELVIRA MADIGAN.  Not surprisingly, that is the (admittedly anachronistic) nickname this concerto has because of its cinematic use.  The 27th, in B Flat Major, omits trumpets and timpani, and was the last of the concertos that Mozart composed for the piano (he premiered it in early 1791, just ten months before his untimely demise).  The work is shot through not only with virtuosity, but also with a certain kind of poignancy.All the elements of these two concertos are bought out by O'Conor, Mackerras, and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, an ensemble very familiar with the works of the wunderkinder from Salzburg.  This is what, for me, makes this Telarc recording well worth having, even if you already have other recordings of these concertos in your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK4GEQLVDGEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003CW5#wasThisHelpful","R3QK4GEQLVDGEQ","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gustavo Dudamel's (thus far) five-year tenure as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra has been, quite simply, extraordinarily unique in the way he has done things.  Of course the same thing could be said about Zubin Mehta, Carlo Maria Giulini, Andre Previn, and Esa-Pekka Salonen (Dudamel's immediate successor); but Dudamel has really set the bar high, not only for the L.A. Philharmonic, but for a lot of other young music directors of the world's major orchestras.  The recording that Dudamel and the orchestra made of the Mahler Ninth, one of the most emotionally extreme symphonies in the entire repertoire, was one of the best recordings of 2013, classical or otherwise.  And this recording of John Adams' combination opera/oratorio ""The Gospel According To The Other Mary"" is on that level for 2014 as well.After the 1982 recording of Giuseppe Verdi's opera ""Falstaff"", which was done with Giulini on the podium, this is probably the longest and biggest recording the L.A. Philharmonic has ever taken on, running to two hours and thirteen minutes.  But this very contemporary work from one of America's finest composers, a continuation of themes first broached in Adams' previous Nativity piece ""El Nino"", is rendered quite vividly, with the stories of Mary Magdalene and Martha given a contemporary touch, thanks to Adams and the staging of Peter Sellars (who handled similar duties on ""El Nino"").  And it comes complete with a solid cast: Kelley O'Connor as Mary Magdalene; Tamara Mumford as Martha; and Russell Thomas as Lazarus, along with countertenors Daniel Bubeck, Brian Cummings, and Nathan Medley.Along with great assistance from the Los Angeles Master Chorale, superbly prepared by their director Grant Gershon, Dudamel and the L.A. Philharmonic prove why they are one of the great conductor/orchestra combines of our age.  Is ""The Gospel According To The Other Mary"" a masterpiece?  Only time will tell, and I think that's up to the gods of music.  But for my tastes, it is definitely one of the great recordings of 2014, classical or otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R0PP5DAV0GT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGFILU8#wasThisHelpful","R3R0PP5DAV0GT8","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believed to have been composed between August 1775 and January 1777, the Concerto In E Flat Major for two pianos technically counts as being the tenth of Mozart's twenty-seven concertos, that huge and prodigious body that would set the standards for all piano concertos from Mozart's time forward.  Although it is not performed with the same frequency as his later works (especially the final eight concertos, 20-27), this ""Double"" piano concerto, believed to have been composed by Mozart for performance by him and his sister Maria Anna (""Nannerl""), is nevertheless a fascinating experiment of Mozart's, one that requires a pair of solid keyboard virtuosos to do (and for the composer's Seventh piano concerto, you needed three soloists).Fortunately on this 1984 Teldec recording, we have the required two keyboard virtuosos, both of whom come from very divergent musical backgrounds.  Austrian-born pianist Friedrich Gulda came from a classical music background and began exploring jazz later on in his life; while Chick Corea is one of the best-known pianists in American jazz music, and, like fellow jazz musicians Wynton Marsalis and Herbie Hancock, developed a great feel for classical music.  The two men first got together for joint performances; and for this recording, they reconvened in Amsterdam to record Mozart's Double Concerto with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt.  Also added on this recording (since the Mozart is only twenty-five minutes long) are two works for two pianos, each written by the soloists themselves: Gulda's ""Ping Pong""; and Corea's ""Fantasy For Two Pianos"".Both of the two-piano works make for very solid encores that combine classical and jazz very brilliantly, and on the Mozart they acquitted themselves quite well with what is still (even after nearly two hundred forty years) a very innovative  work, proving that Mozart wasn't content at resting on his laurels.  Harnoncourt, often the target of criticism for taking liberties with many of the Classical-era works he recorded that many reviewers have found bizarre and even perverse at times, here plays it straight in his conducting, with the Concertgebouw Orchestra being at its usual world-class best.This is highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHKX1YXFJH7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M3QV2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1GHKX1YXFJH7D","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knowing that his symphonies were much too large for audiences of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to understand, Gustav Mahler was fond of remarking, ""My time will come.""  And it did.  But it took a couple of World Wars, and a thorough going over by such conductors as Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter, who knew Mahler when they were young men, for all of that to happen.  The true Mahler revival really came in the 1960s, when those conductors plus others like Rafael Kubelik, Leonard Bernstein, and Zubin Mehta took up the cause.  And one orchestra in particular was seemingly tailor-made for Mahler's gigantic symphonic pallet.  That orchestra was Amsterdam's Concertgebouw Orchestra.Perhaps no orchestra has ever had the kind of intimate history with Mahler that the Concertgebouw has, and this goes back to Willem Mengelberg and Edward van Beinum, who also knew Mahler quite well.  During the acceleration of the Mahler revival in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the orchestra was led by Bernard Haitink; and their surveys of the Mahler symphonic canon were extremely acclaimed.  One example can be found in this recording of Mahler's Firs Symphony.Known by many as the ""Titan"" Symphony, and for good reason (though the composer dismissed the appellation after initially approving it after he had composed it in 1888), it bears many of the early hallmarks not only of Mahler's output but also of what music would be like for much of the 20th century.  The eerie depiction of dawn, signaled by a high `A' in the strings, hunting horn calls, and the like in the first movement is then followed by a second movement Scherzo highly influenced by the Austrian dance form known as the Landler.  In the third movement, the dark side of Mahler emerges in a distorted D minor riff on the French nursery rhyme ""Frere Jacques""; and as that dies off, the fourth movement begins with an almost apocalyptic scream and eventually evolves into a firestorm, capped off by a final chorale that sounds much like the ""He shall reign forever and ever"" passage of the Hallelujah Chorus in Handel's ""Messiah.""Both Haitink and the Concertgebouw had recorded the Titan Symphony once before in 1962; but this recording, made in May 1972, is really one of the most solid ones this work has received, on par with this same orchestra's 1987 rendering of it with Bernstein on the podium (for Deutsche Grammophon), though not quite as extreme.  Not counting the Fourth, the Titan Symphony is probably the most popular of Mahler's nine examples of his gigantic symphonic vision; and this 1972 recording of it is incredible proof of why that is.  The sheer professionalism and intensity of the performance is a marvel to behold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13I1IP8M9IHD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E3I0#wasThisHelpful","R13I1IP8M9IHD0","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Walter Hill's 1993 film GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND was one of the finest Westerns to be released in the wake of the huge successes of DANCES WITH WOLVES and UNFORGIVEN.  Taking a very even-handed look at the U.S. Cavalry's hunt along the US/Mexico border in the mid-1880s for the maverick Apache warrior known to his people as Goyakla, but know to us ""White Eyes"" as Geronimo, the film is quite rich with authenticity and realism in a way that hadn't been seen with too much regularity in Westerns or action films since the days of Sam Peckinpah.  It is a shame that it was only a modest box office hit when it was released in 1993 (though a very good Western released at roughly the same time, TOMBSTONE, may have had a little bit to do with that).One of the ways that GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND works so well is because of a key component of Hill's creative team, and that is roots music legend Ry Cooder.  Cooder, a mainstay of what we now call ""Americana"" since the mid 1960s, provided Hill with an ultra-traditional country/folk score for the director's violent 1980 opus THE LONG RIDERS.  For GERONIMO, the music here is a mixture of military brass band music, American folk songs (""Poor Wayfaring Stranger""; ""Battle Cry Of Freedom"", etc.) and authentic Native American music, the latter featuring ""shaped note"" orchestrations by George Clinton.  In not too dissimilar a fashion from what Leonard Rosenman did in integrating Native American influences into his score for the 1970 western A MAN CALLED HORSE, Cooder's integration of such influences helped to increase the authenticity of the film--authenticity being something that Hill (like Peckinpah before him) was a stickler for, but also which Hollywood studios weren't known for.  It can also be compared to the way Jerry Fielding mixed in ethnic Mexican influences for Peckinpah (THE WILD BUNCH; BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA); and just as Fielding's approach wasn't really appreciated fully in his time, neither was Cooder's for this film--save for the true film music connoisseurs.It would seem that this soundtrack score is out of print everywhere else but Amazon.  And that's why anyone with a fondness for ethnic American music, especially when revived from the distant past as it was by Cooder for this film, should get it without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSTA3084YDZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000029H6#wasThisHelpful","RPSTA3084YDZI","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until the late 1960s and early 1970s, a great deal of the music-listening public didn't realize how significant a composer of symphonies Franz Schubert really was.  Unless it was his Fifth, Eighth, or Ninth symphonies, most of the public didn't know that the young Vienna native, during his short life, had been able to work in a discipline that had been mastered by legends like Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.  This, of course, has changed, with more orchestras and conductors willing to explore this aspect of Schubert's career.  One of the most prominent, and, for many, controversial conductors in this aspect is Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who recorded the Schubert symphonic cycle for Teldec in 1992 with Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, of which this recording is a part of.The Third Symphony, in D Major, even for the work of an eighteen year-old, which is the age Schubert was at in 1815 when he composed it, is one of the least known of the symphonies, even though, in terms of orchestral proportion and format, it isn't so terribly far removed from its models, with a highly enjoyable slower second movement, and a third movement that is a cross between a Minuet and a Scherzo, plus a Beethoven/Rossini-influenced finale.  The two other symphonies on this recording, the chamber-like Fifth (which might be seen as Schubert's Pastoral Symphony), and the two-movement Eighth (the legendary ""Unfinished"") are the ones that audiences are the most familiar with; in many ways, like several of Beethoven's symphonies, the Unfinished is a work that looks forward towards Brahms, Bruckner, and Mahler.The reason Harnoncourt's interpretations of Schubert are controversial in some quarters lies in the perception that he takes a number of eccentric liberties, in part based on his original background in period-instrument practices, that are rather bothersome to some people.  Those aren't evident in the Fifth or the Eighth, where he largely plays it straight (though there is a drop-off in sound at the end of the first-movement exposition of the Fifth).  In the Third, though, he does seem to emphasize the loudness of the trumpets and the timpani in the opening movement and the final two movements in a way that many find jarring, and understandably so.  There are solid recordings of this symphony available that are less emphatic than Harnoncourt's, both by U.S. orchestras: Kurt Masur's with the New York Philharmonic (also on Teldec), and Raymond Leppard's with the Indianapolis Symphony (on Koss Classics).Still, the classical recording market is still not as flush with Schubert symphonic cycles as it is with those of Beethoven or Mahler; and there are only a handful of individual recordings of the early symphonies (and even fewer by our own American orchestras).  So for all its rather strange eccentricities, this Harnoncourt/Concertgebouw recording is still worth searching out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265OFZR9FIITX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000SPS#wasThisHelpful","R265OFZR9FIITX","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Along with some of the broken works of Erich von Stroheim (GREED) and Orson Welles (THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS), director Sam Peckinpah's 1965 Civil War-era Western MAJOR DUNDEE, the gritty and somewhat violent sagebrush epic of an obsessed Cavalry officer (Charlton Heston) out to prove himself by forming a ragtag mix of Union officers, Confederate prisoners, and other miscreants to hunt a murderous renegade Apache named Sierra Charriba into a Mexico occupied by French forces in the last six months of the Civil War, is one of the best known examples of the Hollywood studio system nearly bringing to his knees an admittedly truculent director with a vision far different from the studio (in this case, Columbia) and the producer (Jerry Bresler).  Time has been far kinder in recent years to this film; even though it is still a flawed film, and a problematic one, it does show the path that Peckinpah would take from THE WILD BUNCH onward.But one of the reasons Peckinpah was so infuriated with both Columbia and Bresler over MAJOR DUNDEE, and one of the reasons why he for all intents and purposes disowned it, is in the music score by the Russian-born composer Daniele Amfitheatrof.  Almost certainly at the insistence of both the studio and the producer, since Peckinpah was only working on his third film (and first with a large budget), and had none of the creative controls that many directors, Peckinpah included, would insist on in later years, Amfitheatrof composed the score in a way that would be quite appropriate for a traditional cavalry western, with refrains of ""Dixie"", ""The Battle Hymn Of The Republic"" and such, and with a good deal of martial music (one theme of which resembles nothing so much as ""Three Blind Mice"") and a signature three-anvil ""ping"" sound meant to represent Charriba's presence, complete with Mitch Miller's Sing-A-Long Gang doing the ""Major Dundee March"" (""Fall in behind the Major"", etc.).  In a way, it's like the scores of Dmitri Tiomkin or Richard Hagerman (the latter of whom worked with John Ford).  It was from a time when films had wall-to-wall music in them, even in sequences where it might have been better not to have it there.All this is good and fine...again, for a traditional cavalry western.The problem, however, is that MAJOR DUNDEE is not a traditional cavalry western by any stretch of the imagination.  It is much harder-edged, more fraught with tensions, and the violence is much more in evidence.  It was a film that needed a score that was much grittier and more enigmatic--something akin to what a composer like Jerry Fielding (who would work closely with Peckinpah soon enough) or Jerry Goldsmith would be able to deliver.  It was also a big reason why, when MAJOR DUNDEE was re-released to DVD in 2005 for its 40th anniversary, it had a brand new score on it as done by Christopher Caliendo.  The bottom line is that Amfitheatrof's score is serviceable as it is, but it doesn't really fit the movie it goes with.What would be most interesting, and what should be done in the future, is to have both this score and Caliendo's more ethnically-inclined 2005 score put on the same CD, as had been done for the 1976 western THE LAST HARD MEN (with the original and unused Leonard Rosenman score, and bits and pieces from previous Goldsmith scores), for comparison's sake, and let the individual listener decide which one is more appropriate to MAJOR DUNDEE, a troubled but very worthy mid-1960s Western opus from a director whose stature would soon loom large over the way Hollywood would do Westerns and all other kinds of action films from the late 1960s to the present.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRN6XTJZ6IHWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V9K4SI#wasThisHelpful","RRN6XTJZ6IHWW","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much of opera, like all the best art of any kind throughout history, has dealt with issues of the human heart; and occasionally that falls into politics, whether it is in the high Italian comic opera of Mozart's ""The Marriage Of Figaro"" or the struggle fro freedom in Beethoven's ""Fidelio"".  And in our time, there is longtime movie music composer Don Davis' ""Rio De Sangre"" (or ""River Of Blood"").Davis, a native of Orange County here in Southern California, is remembered for his work in motion pictures, from helping with the orchestrations of DIE HARD 2 and TITANIC to eventually doing his own scores for the Warchowski Brothers' MATRIX films, and in 2001, with John Williams' hearty approval, JURASSIC PARK III.  With all these successes in a field that is not only not fully understood but still not highly regarded as ""serious"" music in all quarters, Davis was taking a huge risk in not only doing an opera, but one with a political subtext to it that comments on many recent events.  But with help from a very solid librettist in Kate Gale, that's what he did here.  ""Rio De Sangre"", sung totally in Spanish, is set in an unnamed country in Latin America racked by war, violence, and a military coup d'etat that the characters are caught up in.  Even for opera, this is fairly heavy subject matter; but again, like all good art, it makes a comment on contemporary issues that are not so easily ignored.  In this recording, its world premiere, the opera is given a first-rate treatment by Milwaukee's Florentine Opera Company, which had also given us a magnificent performance of William Aldridge's opera ""Elmer Gantry"" a couple of years ago as well, and a solid cast.  Joseph Rescigno is on the podium to conduct the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.Because of its Latin American setting, Davis' music is chock full of Latin influences like meringue and salsa, much like the scores of films set in Latin America.  The end result in ""Rio De Sangre"" is an opera of enormous brilliance for our time, and one just plain worth acquiring, tragic though the story may be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8NX69DN24C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ERIBP0#wasThisHelpful","R1H8NX69DN24C2","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without a doubt, director Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A CLOCKWORK ORANGE remains one of the most controversial and disturbing movies of all times.  Alongside Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS, released also around the same time (near the end of 1971), it was a scathingly intellectual and blackly comic film about the nature of crime, violence, and sex that offended a great many people on both sides of the Atlantic.  And much of that film's impact, not surprisingly, came from the way Kubrick integrated classical music into the internal fabric of the film--albeit much more cynically and ironically (and for good reasons too) than the way he had used it in his earlier 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Beginning with the ominous, futuristic, and synthesized adaptation of baroque master Henry Purcell's ""Music For Queen Mary's Funeral"" in the arrangement by Walter (later Wendy) Carlos, of the landmark 1968 album SWITCHED ON BACH, the soundtrack contains a mixture of straightforward orchestral versions of well-known pieces, such as the Pomp And Circumstance Marches 1 & 4 of Sir Edward Elgar, Rossini's Thieving Magpie Overture, and parts of the second and fourth movements of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, along with weird electronic versions of Rossini's William Tell Overture (heard in that wacky ménage-a-trois that Malcolm McDowell has with the two girls he brings home, shot at warp speed by Kubrick), and the aforementioned Beethoven 9th excerpts as arranged by Carlos, as well as one of Carlos' own ultra-futuristic pieces (""Timesteps"").  The bizarre and dark comedy of the film also allow for off-the-wall pieces like Terry Tucker's neo-Renaissance ""Overture To The Sun"" and Erika Eigen's ""I Want To Marry A Lighthouse Keeper"" (heard in the home of McDowell's parents after he has been released from his ""treatment"") to fit into the proceedings that maybe only Kubrick could have ever figured out.  And at the conclusion, we have the famous use of Gene Kelly's original version of ""Singing In The Rain.""The use of electronic and synthesized music here must seem a peculiar oddity in our EDM (electronic dance music) society, as compared to the early 1970s, but it definitely fits in here, since the film is more or less set in a very clinical near-future England.  In particular, Kubrick's utilization of the Beethoven 9th, especially its fourth movement ""Ode To Joy"", in both electronic and orchestral form, became the film's musical calling card, as Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" had become for `2001""; and its use here was said to have inspired director John McTiernan to persuade Michael Kamen to use that piece in the 1988 blockbuster action film DIE HARD.Despite what some see as outdated electronica, and to what now seems an allegedly ""tame"" horrorshow on ultra-violence, the soundtrack to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE still remains quite vital and powerful, and is a must-have for any serious music connoisseur's record collection, classical, motion picture, or otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5K4KDEQ482L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KDU#wasThisHelpful","RL5K4KDEQ482L","A2D8CUJPOSRPNA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It’s late in 1898, and in Clearwater, Texas, Katie Elder is about to be buried.  Her three oldest sons have been summoned by the preacher, though only two have arrived in time to attend the service.  Or maybe not.Oldest brother John (John Wayne) is a gunfighter of some fame, Tom (Dean Martin, partnering with Wayne for the first time since “El Dorado”) is a gambler who’ll bet on anything and occasionally behaves a little like a con artist, and Matt (Earl Holliman), though much quieter than either of them, hasn’t been home in three years and has apparently made several tries at starting a business, all of which have failed.  Youngest Bud (Michael Anderson, Jr.), almost 18, was his mother’s hope: she connived and struggled to get him to the School of Mines in Colorado—but he doesn’t want to go; though he was almost too young to remember John and Tom when they left (they haven’t even seen each other in a decade), he’s heard enough about John especially to want to partner up with him and “be famous, like the Dalton brothers.”  There’s also some question in the minds of the older boys about the ranch that used to be theirs.  Their father, Bass Elder, though he gambled a good deal and was apparently not a very good provider (even John says “I don’t know how [Katie] put up with him”), somehow managed to acquire 1200 acres of good riverside land, on which the quartet grew up.  Six months ago he was shot in the back—on the very same night he had supposedly lost the ranch at blackjack to Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), who has six witnesses and a signed quit-claim to back his occupation of the land.  To John and Tom, especially, this seems more than a little suspicious.  Hastings even admits that he needed the Elders’ water in order to make a go of his gun factory.  (To his son Dave (Dennis Hopper) he privately observes, “You wanta own a town, you gotta lay out some.”)  And he’s imported a hired gun known as Curly (George Kennedy) to make sure the Elders—especially John—don’t make any trouble before they scatter again.  But scattering is the last thing on their minds.  When they find out that their mother had proposed a bold horse deal with Charlie Bob Striker (Rhys Williams) of Pecos, they persuade him to let them try to carry it through so they can at least get enough money to pay for Bud’s schooling and fulfill their mother’s dream.  Then the respected veteran sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix) is killed while on his way to question the boys about a Wanted poster issued on Tom, and his overconscientious young deputy, Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate), organizes a posse.  Sentiment against the Elders is high, and Ben decides to take all four of them to the U.S. Marshal at Laredo.  But what he doesn’t know is that Hastings has already suborned his drivers, and an ambush on the road brings the four brothers to the very edge of death.Well supplied with both action and humor, this is one of Wayne’s better later movies and has something to say about family and what it means.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP14SAQMN8D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB8U6#wasThisHelpful","R3QP14SAQMN8D4","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Make way for the guinea pigs!  Darwin (Sam Rockwell), Blaster (Tracy Morgan), and Juarez (Penelope Cruz), plus their computer expert Speckles (Nicolas Cage), a star-nosed mole, and their “eye-in-the-sky,” Mooch (Dee Bradley Baker), a housefly, are G-Force, a very special team of agents trying to earn accreditation by the FBI.  They were assembled and trained by human Ben (Zach Galifianakis), who was clever enough to realize that animals do talk—to each other, in their own languages—and, with his assistant Marcie (Kelli Garner), was able to create a computer program that converted their sounds to English, plus a dazzling arsenal of miniaturized equipment for them.  Obviously, tiny rodents are much less likely to be noticed sneaking into buildings than humans are, and Ben has high hopes that a forthcoming Bureau inspection will not only renew his funding but legitimize his “guys.”  In quest of this, he sends the team into the headquarters of home-appliance mogul Saber (Bill Nighy), who’s been under investigation by the Bureau for the last couple of years.  And in the secret inner circuits of the company computer they find something that looks to them like a program for world domination.  But when the Bureau team arrives, it not only rebukes Ben for an “unauthorized search,” it cuts off his funding and orders him closed down.  At first the team is threatened with becoming literal “guinea pigs,” but they manage to sneak aboard a nearby delivery truck and join the “stock” of a pet shop, where they meet the overweight Hurley (Jon Favreau), a food-loving guinea pig, Bucky (Steve Buscemi), a hamster who’s thought to be part ferret, and a trio of tuneful mice (Hoyt Yeatman IV, Max Favreau).Desperate to get back to Ben and try once again to prove their worth, the guinea pigs get separated from one another, and Speckles is thought dead.  But once on the loose, Darwin discovers something very sinister about Saber appliances—they actually come to life, and with obvious belligerent intent.  With bare hours remaining until the sinister program activates, the team must find a way to recover their equipment and, pursued by the FBI, get into the corporate computer to insert a virus that will bring the whole thing down.  This delightful and fast-moving take on spy/caper movies features an engaging trio of heroes, rapid-paced action, wonderful gadgetry, and a great twist at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3M3ERPKN5U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QOGY6I#wasThisHelpful","RE3M3ERPKN5U6","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leonard Nimoy (who also served as co-executive producer and co-writer of the original story) and William Shatner were 60 when this movie was released, DeForest Kelly and James Doohan were 71, Nichelle Nichols was 59, and most of them were beginning to show their age, or at least sound like it (notice how rough Nimoy's voice often sounds), so it's not surprising that it was the last of the franchise to feature the original crew.  In fact, at several points Kirk and McCoy mention that they're retiring in a few months.  But if they had to go out, at least they do it with a bang, and in doing so they lead directly in to the situation that will obtain in ST:TNG.Sulu (George Takei) is now captain of the ""Excelsior,"" and apparently the only one of the old company who's still in space.  While on a routine mission, his ship detects a massive explosion on Praxis, an industrialized moon of the Klingon homeworld, Kronos.  Two months later Kirk (Shatner), McCoy (Kelly), Scotty (Doohan), Uhura (Nichols), and Chekhov (Walter Koenig), along with several other members of Starfleet's high command, are summoned to a briefing by Spock (Nimoy), who reveals that the occurrence has doomed Kronos itself: in 50 Terran years the planet will exhaust its oxygen.  Faced with this massive humanitarian (or should that be Klingonitarian?) crisis, Spock, urged by his father Sarek (Mark Lenard), has been in contact with the Klingon rulership and has managed to set up a peace conference.  The Klingon Chanceller Gorkon (David Warner) will be coming to Earth--and the Enterprise has been chosen to escort him.  Despite objections from some of the officers, notably Adm. Cartwright (Brock Peters), and Kirk's own misgivings (""I've never trusted Klingons and I never will,"" he says, noting that he's been unable to forgive them for killing his son, David Marcus), he and his bridge crew are still Starfleet officers and must go where they're sent.  With a new Vulcan navigator, Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall), they set off for the rendezvous point.Following a state dinner lubricated by entirely to much Romulan ale, the Klingon ship is suddenly attacked by torpedoes, then boarded by two figures in magnetic boots who begin firing on Gorkon and his crew, inflicting heavy casualties, including the Chancellor himself.  Enterprise's databases insist she fired the torpedoes, but none are missing from her payload.  Kirk and McCoy beam over to try to save Gorkon, but his wounds are too serious.  The Klingons accuse them of plotting assassination, arrest them, and take them to Kronos for trial, where they're found guilty and sentenced to life at hard labor in the dilithium mines on Rura Penthe, a bitterly cold planetoid where survival on the surface is virtually impossible.  It's up to Spock, Scotty, and the rest to find out the truth about the attack and rescue their fellows--who, meanwhile, have been contacted by a fellow laborer, Martia (Iman), who offers to help them escape.  But Martia may not be all she appears.There's plenty of action, as we've come to expect, in this last outing for Kirk & Co., yet we also learn that Klingons care for justice (perhaps a natural outgrowth of an honor-obsessed warrior culture): they provide their prisoners with a defense attorney who seems to be sincere about his work.  And it turns out, too, that in this Universe Sherlock Holmes really existed: Spock reveals that ""an ancestor of mine"" once declared that ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how incredible, must be the truth.""  His efforts at detection, aided by the rest of the bridge crew, are a high point, and of course the effects, the aliens, and the music add immeasurably to the enjoyability quotient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X773YK2YD9PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000UJL96#wasThisHelpful","R2X773YK2YD9PQ","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1969, Penny Chenery (Diane Ladd), a Virginian by birth, is living in Denver, married to lawyer Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh) and the mother of four—two teenage daughters and two elementary-school sons—when word comes that her mother has died.  Returning to the Thoroughbred farm where she grew up, she finds her father (Scott Glenn) sliding into dementia and her brother Hollis (Dylan Baker) talking about selling out.  But Penny’s a horse lover, and she knows that two of the farm’s mares are in foal to Bold Ruler, a horse known for his speed but unable till now to sire anything with staying power, a gift she hopes the Chenery mares can provide.  When she learns that her father’s will includes a codicil leaving the disposition of the farm to Hollis but that of the horses to her, she knows she has the leverage she needs—because what is a Thoroughbred farm without horses, and where are horses to live but on a farm?  Willy-nilly, Hollis and Jack must accept that Penny will run the farm even if it means missing out on much of her family’s lives.The following spring, one of the much-anticipated foals proves to be a chestnut colt whom everyone on the farm calls simply Red, but whose official name (after some wrangling with the racing authority) is Secretariat.  Though he “loves to run,” he loses his very first race, at age two, but with the subsequent help of French-Canadian trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) and his countryman jockey Ronnie Turcotte (Otto Thorwarth), he wins seven races in four months and is named Horse of the Year.  Although some believe that the longer races in which three-year-olds are entered will be his downfall, Penny and groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) never lose their faith in him, and in 1973 he sweeps the Triple Crown, the first time any horse has done so in a quarter-century—and sets records in each of the three races.The pace of the movie is somewhat slow, but Penny’s stubborn resolve and her evident love for her horse are inspiring for family viewing, and the race sequences are thrilling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ZHWDL1C2AYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DK5CW4#wasThisHelpful","R36ZHWDL1C2AYP","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If we ever harbored any doubts that J. J. Abrams’s new Trek franchise was taking place in an alternate Universe, this second movie should lay them to rest.  During it we learn that Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are, or have been, apparently physically involved, and that the planet Vulcan was destroyed at some point in the recent past (how and by whom is not revealed, although Spock is never said to be the last of his race; there were probably millions of Vulcans in Starfleet or on colony worlds who survived).  And Kirk (Chris Pine) and his hotshot young crew, including Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Science Officer 0718 (Joseph Gatt), who appears to be a cyborg, not only endure the loss of their patron, Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood)—who, of course, lived on into Kirk’s 30’s in the classic TV series—but find themselves confronting one Khan Noonian Singh (Benedict Cumberbatch) long before they did so in the original Trek reality.When a supposed Starfleet archive site under the city of London is destroyed, protocol requires that all Starfleet’s senior captains currently on Earth meet at Fleet HQ to discuss the act and its repercussions.  It takes Kirk’s quick, unconventional mind to realize that the sabotage may have been bait to get them to do exactly that—but not soon enough to prevent a violent commando assault that kills Pike.  Kirk manages to cripple the attackers’ small ship, but the leader gets away with a personal transporter unit (much advanced from the kind the Fleet uses: it can, and does, send him lightyears away—to Kronos, the Klingon homeworld).  Eventually the Enterprise crew discovers that Khan is a product of the eugenics effort of some 300 years ago, bred to be a superior example of humanity with a warrior’s thought processes, and later found and revived from suspended animation by Adm. Marcus (Peter Weller), whose daughter Carol (Alice Eve) has wangled her way on board.  Marcus, it seems, believes that Starfleet’s peaceful exploratory mandate is insufficient to meet the building threat of the Klingons, who have attacked several planets in the Federation sphere, and plans to use Khan and the Enterprise to launch a war.  In the end, after Spock has somehow contacted his alter ego Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy)—how is never clarified—a savage space battle ensues between the Enterprise and Marcus’s heavily modified ship, on which Scotty (Simon Pegg) has stowed away, and Kirk must risk his own life to save his crippled ship in a twist ending that will astonish and delight viewers who’ve enjoyed the original franchise.  The door is left open for still more entries—I hope that there’s some intention to explain who was responsible for Vulcan’s fate.  The special effects are, of course, a lightshow unequalled since the Jefferson Starship played the Fillmore, and the score is majestic and thunderous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S6K8MG9F95WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZMFJYA#wasThisHelpful","R3S6K8MG9F95WV","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s a celebrity making news (or should that be “mews”?) in Mercy, S.C., and he has four legs and a tail.  His name is Clyde, and he’s a huge, sweet-tempered orange tabby cat who has just walked more than 200 miles (it took him two months) to return to his master, Norm Jeffreys, who had sent the cat to live with his sister while he endured the last stages of liver cancer.  When he got to Jeffreys’s door, though, the man was already dead.  As Jillian Hart’s good friend, Deputy Candace Carson, observes, “if not for Clyde, his body would still be lying there undiscovered.”  But it’s now been three days since Clyde’s return, and the authorities are still investigating Jeffreys’s death, which makes Jillian think they suspect foul play.  Meanwhile the local animal shelter, where Clyde has been lodged until it can be decided who should have custody of him, is besieged with TV reporters, so Jillian has agreed to have Clyde smuggled into her house and take care of him until his future can be decided.As it turns out, foul play did indeed take place: the bottle of digitalis in Jeffreys’s home didn’t contain enough pills for when the prescription was last filled.  Who overdosed him, how, and why?  Says Candace, “He was gonna die, but apparently not soon enough, according to someone out there.”  When Clyde slips out of Jillian’s house and once again homes in on Jeffreys’s, Jillian and Candace find the man’s home-health aide inside, murdered.  Digitalis OD could conceivably be an accident, or even suicide, but Buford Miller’s death wasn’t.  Meanwhile Jillian and her not-quite-fiancé, Tom Stewart, discover that Norm Jeffreys left an estate of “at least a million dollars,” which, as Jillian realizes, might well be a motive for murder.  But was he killed by the same person who killed Buford?  Dealing with a pushy Asian-American reporter who sees Clyde as her steppingstone to national fame, as well as with a constellation of Jeffreys relatives either odd or unpleasant, Jillian soon finds her home security system compromised, her house broken into, and Clyde on the loose again.  Long-buried secrets are revealed as she, Tom, and Candace pursue the missing feline.

"In the sixth Magical Cats mystery, it’s early December in Mayville Heights, Minnesota, and librarian Kathleen Paulson finds life good.  She’s decided to settle in permanently as head of the local library; she and her sometimes guyfriend, Detective Marcus Gordon, have finally come to an understanding about Kathleen’s tendency to get involved in Marcus’s cases; and Rebecca Nixon, one of Kathleen’s best friends, is going to marry her childhood sweetheart, Everett Henderson, after nearly 50 years of yearning.  Then, at a fund-raiser for one of the library’s juvenile programs, an unexpected guest—Dayna Chapman, who happens to be the ex-wife of Burtis Chapman, another of Kathleen’s friends, and the long-estranged mother of his sons—dies of an allergic reaction after eating a cupcake.  Why she even came back to Mayville Heights is a mystery to everyone, including her ex, and how pistachio nuts (the trigger for her reaction) happened to get into her cupcake when baker Olivia Ramsey is herself allergic to cashews, is another.  But the police lab discovers that all the chocolate cupcakes in the box from which Dayna took her treat were coated with pistachio oil—which suggests that somebody intended to kill her.  When Burtis’s son Brady is suspected of being that somebody, Kathleen and her two mysterious cats, Hercules (who can walk through walls) and Owen (who can make himself invisible at will), get involved in the investigation.  As Kathleen notes, both cats “somehow knew what was a clue and what wasn’t,” and they guide her past assorted red herrings until she discovers that the murder actually ties in to a long-ago robbery.  Like Kathleen herself, you’ll probably be surprised at the killer’s identity.

"This entry into the Marvel mythos takes us back to the dark days of World War II, specifically 1942, where we meet Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a ""90-pound asthmatic"" from Brooklyn who, in his boyhood, ""didn't know enough to walk away from a fight"" and consequently spent most of his life getting beaten up.  Now he desperately wants to serve his country, and a factory job isn't enough: he wants to fight.  He's tried five times to enlist, and been rejected each time.  Then he's noticed by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a refugee from Germany who, apparently unaware of the Fuhrer's plans for world domination, originated for him a serum that can make an ordinary man into a ""super soldier""--and worked, to a point, on its first subject, Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), but also transformed him into the grotesque, crimson-skinned Red Skull, the head of a secret military program called Hydra.  Impressed by Steve's devotion to his country, Erskine gets him into the program, and the serum works even better this time: suddenly Steve's cells can regenerate (thereby curing his various maladies), he can bend iron, punch through armored glass, sprint at 40 MPH, toss grown men around like beanbags, and jump 50' or more.  But a German spy has infiltrated the audience, and Erskine is killed and his machines destroyed.  ""He promised me an army,"" growls Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), ""and I got...you.""  Unwilling to risk the only super soldier the US is likely to have, he sends Steve off on a tour to drum up the purchase of war bonds.  Then Steve learns that his lifelong buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), has been captured by the Germans while trying to put a stop to Hydra.  Helped by British MI5 liaison Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and wealthy defense contractor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper)--probably Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark's great-grandfather--he sets out on a lone commando raid and manages to rescue some 400 men being used by Schmidt as slave labor.  But in the process he learns that Schmidt has somehow obtained a mysterious artifact (supposedly ""left on Earth by the gods"") which he has used to create weapons that literally disintegrate their targets in a flash of blue lightning.  What's more, he's decided that with it he can make himself--not Hitler--the master of the world.  Now it's up to Steve--""Captain America""--to find and obliterate Schmidt's hidden weapons factories, and stop him before he can take off in his giant flying wing, the Valkyrie, to destroy New York and Chicago.As always, the special effects are great and the characters, despite their fantastic powers, retain comprehensible human emotions that make it easy to root (or hiss) for them.  It would have been nice to know something more about Schmidt's artifact--what *is* it, really?--but presumably even he wasn't quite sure how it got where he found it.  And, of course, there's plenty of fast, violent (but not graphic) action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSBTAZP9FN30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5I2MEK#wasThisHelpful","R1DSBTAZP9FN30","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original Anthony Hope novel on which these movies were based was the founding father of a string of ""Ruritanian romances""--swashbuckling adventure tales of, usually, an Englishman or American who finds himself in a picturesque European kingdom somewhere within a day's train travel from Paris, and gets involved in intrigues, usually falling in love with a princess or noblewoman by the way.  It's been filmed in two classic versions--one with Ronald Colman in the leading dual role, the other, 15 years later and in lush, vivid Technicolor, with Stewart Granger, but both with virtually identical scripts.  (There was another movie in 1979, and a mini-series in 1984.)  In 1897, Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll (Colman/Granger), a retired officer in Her Majesty's service and member of a noble family, travels to Ruritania for some trout-fishing, wanders onto the royal game preserve in the province of Zenda, and there is discovered by Col. Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith/Louis Calhern) and Capt. Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven/Robert Coote), military attaches to King Rudolf V, who is about to be crowned in the capitol city of Strelsau.  Thanks to an affair between Rassendyll's great-great-great-grandmother Amelia and their mutual great-great-great-grandfather Rudolf III, the two men are not only fifth cousins but virtually identical--which proves to be fortuitous, for the King's wine is drugged that night and in the morning he's still out like the well-known light.  If he doesn't appear for the coronation, his jealous half-brother, Prince Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Raymond Massey/Robert Douglas), will proclaim himself Regent, set the King's cousin, betrothed bride, and heir apparent Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll/Deborah Kerr) on the throne as Queen, and then force her to marry him so he can sit on the throne.  If Rassendyll will consent to pose as the king, however--just for 24 hours or so, till the drug wears off--Michael can be confounded.  Reluctantly, he agrees--only to find that when Flavia presents herself to swear homage to him, he falls in love at first sight.  Then, when he and Zapt return to the King's hunting lodge, they find that he's been abducted.  Unexpected help comes from Antoinette deMauban (Mary Astor/Jane Greer), Michael's mistress, who knows that if he marries Flavia she'll never have him, and is willing to go into exile with him if it will save his life.  But the king is imprisoned in the fortresslike castle of Zenda, stronghold of Rupert, Baron Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks Jr./James Mason), who has an agenda of his own.  And will Rudolf be willing to rescue him if it means losing Flavia?Rassendyll's and Flavia's love (""I love you now with all my heart,"" she says, ""when I never even liked you before"") always seems rather implausible to me, but the intrigues of the story, the twists and quick action, make it enjoyable simply as adventure, and in that spirit I can recommend it.  It's also, like almost all pre-1970 movies, a good family flick and may even provide talking points about love and duty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZU0C60IHFTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KJU13C#wasThisHelpful","R1WZU0C60IHFTP","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are scams, there are stings, and there are capers, and this movie grafts the last onto the comedy-Western and succeeds delightfully.  It’s 1877, and Sam Whiskey (Burt Reynolds) is a gambler, drifter, and jack-of-all-trades who can never resist a bet or a pretty woman, and often gets in trouble for his pains.  Born in a snowstorm while his parents were crossing the plains, he was orphaned in infancy and raised by a saloonkeeper who, apparently ignorant of his real name, called him “Whiskey” for the barrel that was his first cradle.  He’s also a veteran of the Union Army who “shot Ben Pinkerton in the leg once,” apparently by accident, since Ben holds no grudge; in fact, he’s recommended Sam highly to Laura Breckenridge (Angie Dickinson), the daughter of a well-regarded family who needs a man to do a very unusual job.  It seems that her late husband decided to finance a filibustering expedition by stealing $250,000 in gold bars (a bit over 1300 troy pounds, or 975 standard ones, at 19th-Century prices) from the Denver Mint and replacing them with gilded lead.  The gold was loaded onto the riverboat Bonnie Blue, which sank in 15 feet of water in the middle of the Platte River.  Now the Mint is scheduled to begin coining the supposed gold it holds—which will mean the discovery of the lead.  Laura wants the base metal replaced with the real gold (which, of course, first has to be pulled up out of the wreck) before the substitution can be found out (though why she fears her husband will be connected with it is never explained).  And she’ll pay $20,000 to any man who can do it.Sam recruits Jed Hooker (Ossie Davis), a literal black smith, and an old friend from his Army days, O. W. (Oliver Wendell?) Bandy (Clint Walker), a soft-spoken, well-read, bespectacled, and incredibly strong inventor (he’s developed an automatic corn sheller, a household fan, and something that looks suspiciously like a Gatling gun (actually patented in 1862)), and sets off to dredge the gold up from the Platte—which brings on a confrontation with Fat Henry Hobson (Rick Davis), a smooth-talking river pirate with glasses that look more like Mason jars than anything, and a gang of river trash (led by Del Reeves and Anthony James) from whom Sam barely manages to rescue his partners.  From there it’s on to Denver, where Sam must impersonate a Federal inspector (Woodrow Parfrey), fool the Mint’s director (William Schallert), and figure out how to sneak the gold into the vault and the lead out under the noses of a detachment of military guards.  How he does it is worthy of the best caper artists in modern literature.  Despite some risqué moments between Sam and Laura, this is primarily a quite family-friendly movie that might make a good double feature with “Who’s Minding the Mint?”","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSO3YWXCL9EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYMT9YA#wasThisHelpful","R2TSO3YWXCL9EN","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally published as a six-chapter magazine serial in 1949 and paperbacked eight years later, this is the story of a man who knows he was unjustly condemned but can't clear his name without blackening someone else's.  Captain Dan Gentry has been court-martialed and cashiered for supposedly leading his 20-man detachment, which was bringing vitally-needed remounts to Fort North, into a canyon where a band of renegade Apaches trapped and effectively massacred them: only Gentry and his sergeant, Tim McCune, survived.  What Dan knows quite well is that it wasn't he, but his lieutenant, who gave the order.  Unfortunately the lieutenant was the beloved son of Dan's CO, who is in ill health--the shock of learning the truth could kill him--and has been Dan's hero ever since they first met, during the Civil War, when Dan was only 15 and served under the man for the first time.  So Dan has made a conscious decision not to tell the truth, which means he has no option but to go far away and try to start over.  But before he can get away from the Fort and the nearby mining camp, a train of freight wagons is likewise attacked and wiped out--except for one man who escapes, and a girl whom Dan finds in the wreckage of her wagon, undiscovered by the hostiles.  Three of the wagons were loaded with hardware--stock for the new store to be opened by Caleb Ash, part-time cavalry scout and full-time horse rancher, whose purse will only be fattened when the Army has to replace the horses lost with Dan's detail--and Ash claims it's paid for, to the tune of $1820 wholesale, and therefore his.  The girl, who says she was the wholesaler's daughter and kept his accounts, says different, even after Ash produces a receipt.  Now Dan begins to get suspicious--once may be bad luck, twice may be coincidence, but three times is definitely enemy action.  Is Ash connected to these occurrences?  Is he tipping off the renegades about prime targets so he can profit?  And how can Dan prove it without destroying Major Fitzhugh's picture of his son's character?  With only two allies--Sgt. McCune and saloonowner Mike Clears--he has to try.As always, Dawson weaves a deft plot full of intriguing twists and decisive coincidences, with a hero who thinks quickly and creatively but is far from sure of himself.  This is one of the author's lesser-known Westerns, but a very good one just the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFMUYTJM0X7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Z3C4HI#wasThisHelpful","REFMUYTJM0X7Z","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The final volume in the Intellectual Devotional series offers 365 capsule biographies--one for each day, except Leap Day--of ""the world's most celebrated, brilliant, despicable, and memorable characters.""  There are leaders, philosophers, innovators, villains, authors and artists, rebels and reformers, preachers and prophets, beginning with the Pharaoh Khufu (aka Cheops) and going on to Benazir Bhutto.  The bios are arranged in roughly chronological order (if it had been me, I'd have sorted by birthdate), and each includes the subject's dates and major accomplishments (although I noticed a couple of omissions in that of Theodore Roosevelt, hardly surprising in a man who wore such an assortment of hats in his busy life), plus two or three ""additional facts"" at the bottom of the page.Of the 365, only eight were still living at the time of publication: Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, the Unabomber, Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, Radovan Karadzic, Gunter Grass, and Vaclav Havel.  Of course, as in all such lists, your mileage may vary; personally I'd have ignored these and included instead Christopher Columbus, Beethoven, Robert E. Lee, Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy (for getting a man on the moon, facing down Russia in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and establishing the Peace Corps), Lyndon B. Johnson (for Vietnam and the Great Society, though the latter was something of a bust), Hitler (who almost singlehandedly caused World War II), and Jawaharlal Nehru.  The print is a bit small, which may cause problems for some readers, and the index would have been improved by bolding the page number on which each bio actually appears.

"Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby) is a young Midwesterner who relocated to California after college and became a reporter for the Los Angeles Sun.  One day, assigned to cover an attempted supersonic test flight, he oversleeps, and while he's still on his way to the base, the plane is passed “like I was standing still” by a UFO.  The base CO, not wanting to foster another UFO story, refuses Tim any information about the flight when he arrives, and Tim has no choice but to get off the base.  On his way home, *something* screams by overhead and crashes in the brush by the roadside.  When Tim goes to investigate, he finds a small one-man spacecraft and its pilot—a very humanoid Martian (Ray Walston).  Seeing that the Martian is badly shaken by the crash, Tim—without any thought of broadcasting his find—takes him home to the three-room apartment he rents over a double garage belonging to Mrs. Lorelei Brown (Pamela Britton).Thus begins an unusual friendship.  To fend off the curious, Tim presents his guest as “my Uncle Martin.”  Since the spaceship was badly damaged by the crash, and its repair will require assorted elements and devices that Earth hasn't discovered yet, he hides it in the padlocked bay of the garage and offers the Martian the hospitality of his home.  He learns that the Martian civilization is very advanced (“about 30,000 years” ahead of Earth) and that Martians have a long slate of fascinating powers—among other things, Martin can read minds, understand animal languages, levitate just about anything by pointing his finger, and vanish by extending a pair of silvery antennae.  He's also 450 years old and “a professor of anthropology specializing in this primitive planet”—he's been visiting since at least Shakespeare's day.Before long the two have grown genuinely fond of each other, though their relationship is fraught with problems--everything from Martin's odd ailments (like the time he comes down with VDM-974, or Vitamin Deficiency in a Martian, or gets a toothache in his eye tooth and it affects both his vision and his levitational powers), his attempts to get back home (either by repairing his spaceship or hitching a ride in someone else's), and the difficulties of protecting the truth about his identity (how do you apply for a driver's license if you're a Martian and Martians don't have fingerprints?).  They also have to and fend off the attentions of the widowed Mrs. Brown, who finds Martin very attractive.  But they also learn from each other--Martin introduces Tim to both hard science and high culture, and Tim helps Martin to understand humans and discovers such truths as that trying to change yourself into something you're not for someone else's sake will never lead to happiness.  Of course the whole thing is played for laughs, but there are also morals hidden in the scripts (many of the episodes were written and/or directed by James Komack, with whom Bixby would team in the following decade for ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father""), and at root it's the story of a friendship--how it develops and grows and how important it becomes to both the parties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33C4QM2ZJO6CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T7YYO#wasThisHelpful","R33C4QM2ZJO6CN","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, explains its author, you'll find ""beautiful, strong and honest names of American men and women who made their mark in our nation's past, demonstrated great acts of personal courage, accomplished important things in life, and have shone as beacons of inspiration.""  Rather a tall order, but in fact Danforth assembles a very respectable list--Presidents and First Ladies, signers (of the Declaration of Independence), military figures, authors, artists, actors, scientists, explorers, sports stars, politicians, inventors, musicians, and even a few slightly scandalous types like the 19th-C. actress and dancer Lola Montez, some of them born here, some elsewhere, including ""many heroic Americans you never knew about.""  (I can think of one I'd have added: Casimir, after Casimir Pulaski, the Revolutionary-era ""father of American cavalry,"" which could be shortened to Cass.)  With each entry she provides the derivation of the name, foreign forms, variations, nicknames, and at least one capsulated essay on a famous bearer of it, with his or her dates and something of their claim to fame.There are a few errors of fact which a good editor or proofreader might have caught; for example, diet maven Adelle Davis's dates should be 1904-74, not 18; Kansas was no longer ""Indian Territory"" when Laura Ingalls Wilder went to live there; Brigham Young did become President of the Mormon Church (in 1847), but he didn't run for the US version in '44 (Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, did); Clinton Hart Merriam was born in 1855, not '85; the Flathead Indians were not Cree; Ernest Hemingway commanded a French village militia unit, not US troops; Kit Carson did have two Indian wives, but he also had a Spanish one from New Mexico.  (It's this carelessness that makes me give the book four stars instead of five.)

"Based on fact (the Denver & Rio Grande and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroads really did get into a rather messy argument over a pass called Royal Gorge in 1878-80; it was ultimately settled in court, with the D&RG being allowed to lay the tracks, then lease them to the AT&SF to operate trains on), this is the story of how a man's private quest for truth and justice plays out against the larger events.  Bourke Rold comes to Pueblo in '79, heading for Canon City to find out how his brother Frank (""the only family I ever had"") really died (supposedly he drowned, but he was a good swimmer).  Finding his old commander, General William Palmer, the President of the D&RG, visiting the town in his private car, Bourke stops in for a courtesy call and finds himself hired to keep an eye on one of its tie contractors who sold out to the other side before signing his current contract.  The contractor, Tom Kimbrell, turns out to be rather suspiciously interested in buying up the freighting company that was co-owned by Frank, and the doctor who examined his body died unexpectedly only two days before Rold gets to town.  Coincidence, or did someone want to make sure he didn't talk?  Meanwhile Rold's fiancee has come looking for him--and the Army, from which he quietly absconded when he heard of Frank's death, would like to have a few words with him too.  Then there's the question of why Frank was calling himself Ames, not Rold.  Dawson, as always, builds a surprisingly complex plot filled with apparently minor choices that make all the difference.

"“I'm lucky,” says six-year-old Eddie Corbett (Brandon Cruz).  “Most kids have fathers who are just dads.  But I have a father who's my best friend.”  Eddie's mother died some time ago (we're never told exactly when or of what, although Eddie remembers her telling him that it was his job to look after his father, a charge he interprets as meaning he has to help ""find girls"" for his dad to date; he was probably about five, because he apparently hasn't been to kindergarten, and when it comes time to enroll him in first grade, his dad wonders if it's “too soon”).  His father, Tom (Bill Bixby), is the 32-year-old managing director of “Tomorrow,” a newspaper-insert magazine.  They live in a high-rise apartment in Culver City with a breathtaking view of L.A., and their Japanese housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston (Miyoshi Umeki), who comes in by the day, calls Tom “Mista' Eddie's Fatha” and has succeeded in teaching Eddie to speak rather respectable Japanese (their exchanges tend to leave Tom baffled).  Peripheral members of the family are Tom's free-spirited art director (and Eddie's honorary uncle), Norman Tinker (played by series producer and occasional writer or director James Komack), and ditzy secretary Tina Rickles (Kristina Holland).Bixby and Cruz bonded almost instantly, and the chemistry between them is very real (indeed, the show's success spurred bachelor Bixby to get married and have a son of his own).  This is one of the last of the gentle, old-fashioned “family” sitcoms that could address problems in a semi-serious way, but it also has a definite late-'60's/early-'70's vibe, and with seldom more than two guest stars, it also has a cozy, intimate feel.  Many of the episodes focus on the kinds of problems endemic to child-raising, such as when Eddie is branded “teacher's pet” after Tom begins dating his teacher, or on bullying (a very young Jodie Foster appears as Josephine “Joey” Kelly, whom he, of course, can't hit back when she beats him up), first-day-of-school jitters, honesty, responsibility, academic stumbling blocks, following one's conscience, or the concept of generosity with one's possessions; but, as the title suggests, many others come from Tom's and Eddie's search for “a new mother for us.”  Eddie has all the innocent frankness of his age and sometimes speaks before he thinks, but he's also very good-hearted (once, concluding that Mrs. Livingston is “all alone,” he brings home a little Japanese boy to be her son), bright, and eager to please, and he and Tom spend a lot of time together (the teasers and tags show them on a variety of father/son excursions, from the beach and the amusement park to sailing and fishing to exploring the zoo and a large aviary, usually with Eddie asking questions).  This is a sweet, enjoyable sitcom that everyone can enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPZQD7O7AS1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005R2SHX8#wasThisHelpful","RCPZQD7O7AS1W","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's also a little down, for his long-time lady friend, Pandora Pretty Hawk, has grown ""tired of waiting and worrying during my long absences, and married another.""  That may be why he proceeds as he does when his boss, Chance Ridgeway, sends him to the rich and bustling town of Butte to find out whether a tip that wealthy mineowner Marcus Daly has been targeted by a professional killer is true.  The informant, Digby O'Dhoul, is rather too fond of the bottle, but the fact that he's recently disappeared makes Ridgeway suspicious--why would such an inconsequential person vanish unless someone had reason to fear his wagging tongue?  Merlin learns that O'Dhoul did in fact go to Butte, where he has relatives--and was recently found dead, an apparent suicide.  The local law seems to think it's an open-and-shut case, but Merlin's not ready to give up so easily, especially after he meets Digby's sister.  Then he remembers a snippet of information that Ridgeway included in his description of the dead man, and realizes that it must have been murder.  Now all he has to do is find the killer and prevent Daly's death--but how?Lynde provides a vivid description of what was then the biggest and richest town in the Montana Territory, and a large cast of fascinating characters, including Daly himself, whom Merlin finds to have the common touch, and Karen Killgallen, a visiting actress who can ""perform parts written for both men and women, in voices ranging from a bass to a lilting soprano.""  If you're like me, you won't guess the killer's identity any sooner than Merlin does, and the twist at the end will leave you startled.

"The pseudonymous Peter Dawson, although he wrote a long string of Western novels, was also the author of well over 100 short stories that were published chiefly in the later pulp magazines.  Despite the time pressures of this kind of work (a pulp author had to grind out a lot of product in a comparatively short time if he hoped to make a living at it), his stories are tightly plotted and surprisingly polished, almost like miniature novels in themselves.  This volume collects six of them: ""The Bullet,"" in which Sheriff Tom Marolt must break a ring of stock thieves or find himself ruined by a prickly editor's prose; ""A Notch for Bill Dagley,"" whose title character finds himself caught squarely in the middle of a war between two big outfits; ""Stone Walls,"" in which Yuma parolee Lee Anders is forced into a marshal's job even though he's not allowed to wear guns; ""Doc Gentry,"" whose title character wearies of ""digging Wagon Hammer lead...out of people"" and makes up his mind to practice a little hot-lead surgery; the title piece, which follows Joe Dorn in his efforts to clear himself and his partner of a charge of rustling; and ""Outcast Deputy,"" the longest, in which Hugh Conner, pushed off his little land claim by the local Big Auger, conceives a clever scheme to get back at the man and finds himself (much to his dismay, since he's wanted) deputized by the new sheriff.

Since most of his classmates have very clear plans, he feels rather an odd duck, so he's answered an advertisement for a doctor's assistant in Ballbybucklebo, a short railroad journey from Belfast.  His first surprise is his new boss, Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly, a big man with a rough tongue and a boxer's bent nose.  His second is the people of the village, all of them--to put it charitably--originals.  And then there's Patricia Spence, the would-be civil engineer and childhood polio victim whom he meets while on the train to the city for his day off, and who, as he quickly comes to realize, is the Only Girl.The great strength of the book is Taylor's vivid renderings of the Ballybucklebovians, every one an individual: Mrs. Kincaid, a.k.a. Kinky, Dr. O'Reilly's housekeeper, who performs magic in the kitchen; Lady Macbeth, the cat who's left on the doctor's doorstep, and Arthur Guinness, the doctor's Labrador, who has an R-rated Thing for Barry's trousers; the half-dozen patients who come in regularly for a shot of ""tonic"" (Vitamin B12) in their hindquarters; Maggie MacCorkle, whose headaches occur ""a good two inches"" above her actual head; Councillor Bertie Bishop, ""Ulster's answer to Adolf Hitler,"" who owns half the countryside and isn't above using chicanery to accumulate more of it; Seamus Galvin, the carpenter who never seems to do an honest day's work, and his wife Maureen, who's arranged for them to emigrate to California; Major Basil Fotheringham, a confirmed hypochondriac, and his enabling wife; Mr. Coffin, the aptly-named undertaker; and a large cast of others.  Barry's cases range from the generally unwell to childbirth, and he soon learns that you have to speak to country folk in a language they can understand--no jargon--and have insight into their real concerns even when they can't clearly voice them.  Like all young doctors, he makes mistakes, but he has his triumphs too.  Above all he has to adjust to the powerful personality of Dr. O'Reilly, who would drive many a lesser man away in short order.  But in only a few months they're becoming good friends, teaming up to give Bishop a dose of his own medicine and bring happiness to a girl who's gotten pregnant without benefit of marriage, and O'Reilly is sufficiently impressed that he offers Barry ""partner in a year.""Readers should be aware that there are a few rather graphically described medical procedures, including a childbirth, but on the whole the book is probably not unlike a human-doctor's version of James Herriot's veterinary adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OC9AUTCPLHH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765368242#wasThisHelpful","R2OC9AUTCPLHH5","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Golden Story Book (""128 pages in full color"") will delight all young cat-lovers with its five stories (two poetical and three in prose) of cats both real and fantastical.  There's the unnamed young cat who wants more than anything to go to sea, and when three separate captains refuse him a berth on their ships, originates a clever plan that not only gets him the experience he wants but ultimately leads him to a permanent home.  There's Tiger, the ""small striped kitten,"" who lives a vivid life of ""pretend,"" and the little white kitten who longs to be like his mother and his four sisters (all of them black) until he sees a big and very clever white cat ""walking down the street with a big fish in his teeth.""  There's Terrible Tomkit, the very naughty kitten whose wise grandmother finds a way to improve his behavior, and the Tolliver family, who have ""so many cats...that nobody knew just how many there were""--until the cats eat up the family's fish dinner!  Every page is illustrated with lively color pictures by Aurelius Battaglia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDAYG11CM4CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CK12OQA#wasThisHelpful","R1SDAYG11CM4CI","A3N8RZSXKN1OR2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The exterior of the device is well-made, it's not easily breakable. It is to install to my dog's collar with the assembly clip that came with the GPS tracker.

"Never have seen such a unique desk lamp. It's nice and sleek, so it gives it a whole different feeling then an average lamp to use at a desk. The light is nice and bright and is very functional.

"I've spent some time looking for an efficient non sticking grill mat, and I thought I was really going to be out of luck. The one I bought from the store last week was not very good. So I checked online and I found this one. I was really crossing my fingers hoping the reviews were legit, so I went ahead and made a purchase. This grill mat is amazing! It doesn't stick whatsoever, and comes with more than 1 mat of course, which is great for making food. Happy with this purchase.

"I really think that this is a stylish and great looking watch.  It is not complex.  It has a simple buckle.  It keeps time well. It's easy to read the face of this watch.

It's easy to see the time.  I love the blue circle on the watch face.  It's water resistant...which is nice...no scuba diving but it can get wet!

"My cats love this tree even though we were just a bit frustrated trying to put it together.  I called IRIS and they offered  invaluable help.

"We'll Never Be ApartByEmiko JeanWhat it's all about...This book is a reasonably cool psychological thriller about Alice and her twin sister Cellie.  Various foster homes and issues of abandonment have led to a total disastrous life for Alice and Cellie.  Alice is now in a mental hospital after being involved in a fire that caused death as well as injury.  She is pretty much a mess.  She is also being charged for this fire even though she swears she didn't do it.Why I wanted to read it...This book sounded interesting...intriguing even...that is what brought me to its pages.What made me truly enjoy this book...Alice is a mystery as well as being a mess.  The events in her life are sad as well as chilling.  My question was always this...can she be saved?Why you should read it, too...It's difficult to say much about this book without giving the heart of it away and I don't want to do that.  There were surprises within this book but this book was sort of predictable toward the end.  However that didn't really detract from the book's thread.  It was still an interesting book.  The epilogue leaves one with a bit of a question, though, about Alice and Cellie.  But that could also be a teaser into another book.  So...YA readers who enjoy this kind of thriller...should enjoy reading this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XU04CFPY3FWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054448200X#wasThisHelpful","R1XU04CFPY3FWV","A2UVDPBRZTWN6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVDPBRZTWN6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NeedByJoelle CharbonneauReally should be 3.5 stars...What it's all about...This is one fast paced fun scary and just a teeny bit predictable book.  It started off with a really fast pace and just kept on getting more and more intriguing.  In a few words...a high school students are targeted by this online group called NEED...you type in what you want and NEED determines if your need can be fulfilled.  However...the demands from NEED get more and more dangerous and harmful.  There are a number of suspects who could be behind NEED...I had ideas but no real clue.  Kaylee and Nate start the book off but many of their friends are also involved.Why I wanted to read it...This book sounded really intriguing.  I liked the pace and the writing and it was sort of scary fun!What made me truly enjoy this book...I liked Kaylee and her devotion to her ill brother.  I loved her ""almost"" relationship to her friend Nate and I loved the way she fought for the truth.Why you should read it, too...Readers who love YA as well as a fast paced thriller...should enjoy this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0ASEMGO2FXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544416694#wasThisHelpful","RV0ASEMGO2FXC","A2UVDPBRZTWN6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVDPBRZTWN6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rest Of Us Just Live HereByPatrick NessAn almost 3.5 star book...What it's all about...One thing that I have learned from reading this book...I should have read his other books first...or at least one of them...perhaps A Monster Calls?  This book is good but just a touch confusing.  There is a real world and then there is a terrible other world...there are normal kids with issues and ""indie"" kids with issues.  It's always been this way...apparently...however different eras have had different issues/monsters.  The indie kids get the monsters.  The monsters can be vampire deer...cops with blue lit eyes...and lots of explosions.  Mikey and his friends just want to graduate and finish their school year without their school blowing up.  The indie kids just want to stay alive.  So...every chapter starts off with the monsters and the indie kids disappearing or dying.  Then we get to Mikey and his friends and family...each with their own issues. Anorexia, alcoholism, having OCD, sexuality, being gay, being straight...domineering mothers running for political office...it's all right here in this book.  Oh...and there's Mikey's gay friend Jared...who can cure cats big and small and cure people, too.  Cats...all cats flock to Jared...he is the Cat God.Why I wanted to read it...I wanted to read this because it just sounded really amazing.  Reviews for it were all over the place...readers either seemed to love it or hate it.  I think that readers who were more familiar with this author loved it best...appreciated it best.What made me truly enjoy this book...I loved the contrast between the indie kids and the other kids.  I enjoyed reading about the issues...I loved Jared...the Cat God.  I appreciated Mikey's thoughts.  I loved the way he protected his sisters.  With the first paragraph I was taken away into this bad fantasy disturbing world of monsters and kids disappearing...and in a second back to college applications, lunch, and working after school watching Mikey wash his hands a hundred times.Why you should read it, too...Again...readers who know and love the books written by this author should really love this book.  I just would not start with this one...but that is just me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YV5H24XW40EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R1YV5H24XW40EI","A2UVDPBRZTWN6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVDPBRZTWN6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking another magnesium supplement but have happily switched to this one.  I have faith in Viva Labs and I use many other supplements made by them.  I have always known that the right amount of magnesium is essential to a healthy body.  I like that it helps muscle aches.  I like that it helps with sleep.  I like that it helps protect my body.  Since my body is used to taking these I have not noticed any real changes in my body but I am mostly concerned with keeping my body normal and staying healthy.  These are just a tad smaller and easier to swallow...which I love.  The ingredients in these are fine with me and I have read that chelated magnesium is better...so that is all good!  I try not to take tons of supplements but there are certain ones I feel that I need...for me this is one of them.  I do also eat foods that help me to put magnesium in my body...dark leafy greens, bananas, soy beans, fish and avocados...I do use a magnesium oil for aches and pains, too.Personally...I only take one pill...not two...I received my bottle from the manufacturer for my honest thoughts and that is what I have done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N4KXMMREDSPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQP51ZG#wasThisHelpful","R1N4KXMMREDSPX","A2UVDPBRZTWN6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVDPBRZTWN6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Way I Used To BeByAmber SmithWhat it's all about...Eden is raped in her own home in her own bed in the  middle of the night by her brother's best friend.  Her parents are there.  Her brother is there.  The rapist tells her if she ever says a word about this that he will kill her.  He tells her no one would believe her anyway.  So...Eden does not say a word.  Instead she becomes promiscuous and wild.  She has sex with at least 15 more boys and she is totally out of control.The book is unique in that we see the drastic way Eden changes as she goes from her freshman year until her senior year.  It's sad, distressing and heartbreaking.  It's sad because if Eden could have been strong enough to tell her parents what happened...so much grief and pain could have been prevented.Readers should gain insight and knowledge about this kind of sexual crime and what it might do to individuals as well as families.

"The Swans Of Fifth AvenueByMelanie BejaminWhat it's all about...This book is a unique historical fiction book about Truman Capote and a group of NYC society women that befriended him.  He was gay, clever, funny, whimsical and quite outrageous!  He got them to share things with him.  These ""Swans"" also yearned for his admiration and attention.  However...his favorite Swan of all was Babe Paley.  They were infamous besties.

Clark Gable, Bill Powell, Gary Cooper, Lucille Ball...even Ernest Hemingway...hung out with this group.  Truman was quick to share secrets...Marilyn Monroe was afraid of her mother in law...and didn't have great personal hygiene.  Babe's husband Bill Paley was a known womanizer with a voracious appetite for women and food.  Babe and Truman were often just with each other...but...should she have placed so much trust in him?Why you should read it, too...I loved this book.

"I used this product recently and I really love it.  There are tons of BB and CC creams out in the lovely world of cosmetics that are far more expensive than this one.  They say they are going to do anything and everything but many of them are very drying.  You can actually see your skin flake as you apply.  I don't need tons of coverage but I love that this is a 30 SPF and I like the way it smooths on.  It wasn't drying at all and I did not feel as though my face was encased under a heavy product.

Ok...it's light, refreshing, perhaps a tad woodsy...and it has a light scent that lingers.  It's a young and beautifully vibrant scent!  I would buy this in the future.

"Bradstreet GateByRobin KirminKey characters...and what is going down with them...Professor Storrow, Alice, Charlie, Georgia...all meet at Harvard...where most of this book takes place.  All are truly dysfunctional...from bipolar incredibly unlikeable and totally weird Alice to Charley...innovative ""entrepeneurish"" smart Charley who has major father issues.  That takes us to Georgia...who probably has her own parental issues and then becomes sexually involved with Professor Storrow.  And then we have Professor Storrow...accused of murdering another Harvard student...Julie.  The trauma occurs near graduation and then follows these people for the next ten years of their lives.  During these ten years...Alice spirals out of control, Charley becomes a major yet unfulfilled achiever...Georgia functions yet seems lost...and memories and issues surrounding Professor Storrow seem to haunt everyone.What I thought about this book...This book is different...very character driven...and for me...these characters were interestingly unlikeable.  Alice was so out of control that she was scary.  And again...Charley and Georgia just seemed sad.  Georgia might have been the golden girl that everyone wanted to be with but...she never seemed confident or comfortable in that role.  Charley always wanted to be with Georgia...but Professor Storrow was always in the way.  And then we have Professor Storrow...deceitful, weird, pompous?  I think a combination of all of that.Why you might want to read it, too...I can not say that I loved this book or any of its characters...even Georgia's new born baby was annoying...crying so much and so often that neighbors complained...is this possible?  But...it was fascinating...written in a really unique voice...a clear mesmerizing voice...one that made me want to know about these people...but only from afar.My copy came from NetGalley through Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQ00HO0AW2OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONUYDMY#wasThisHelpful","R1EQ00HO0AW2OM","A2UVDPBRZTWN6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVDPBRZTWN6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Good FamilyByErik  FassnachtWhat it's all about...This family is a mess!  Henry has left his wife.  Julie needs pills to get through the day.  Charlie...back from the mountains and battles of Afghanistan...is pretty much a mess...be prepared for him to toss his cookies at the table just before dinner!  Barkley...youngest son...doesn't really know what he wants other than to write bad killer zombie novels...and teach?  Henry...mid fifties and searching for thrills?  He reminded me of that creepy guy buying drinks, taking viagra and looking for someone to take home with him to his red sheeted black pillowed condo...doing anything he can to hold on to the glow of youth!  Until he can't any more...Why I wanted to read it...I love dysfunctional family novels and this one certainly fit into this genre.  No one was likable at all...in the beginning.  Will that change?  I know what my answer is.What made me enjoy this book...I think what I like most about books like this is that their dysfunction is not my dysfunction.  I can look at it from afar and sort of feel better about me than they feel about themselves...or I can simply say a quick pray that it's them and not me!Why you should read it, too...Readers who love big fat books where the characters have tons of issues...should love this one!  Everyone is certainly having major issues.  The question is...who will be happy at the end?  Or...will anyone be better off at the end?

The wolves tattooed on her arm cover her camp number but stand also for the lives lost...the important lives in her life that are no longer there.  Yael can shift within her skin.  Show her a photo and she can become that person...that was Dr. Geyer's gift to her.  Now she is obsessed with one thing...pretending to be Adele Wolfe in order to win this amazing motorcycle race.

"The Emperor Of Any PlaceByTim Wynne-JonesWhat it's all about...OMG...what a book...at times I was frightened and at other times just totally freaked out.  And at other times I was just sad for Evan...very sad for Evan.But here is what went down.  Evan's father dies rather suddenly.  Evan finds a yellow notebook on his desk that tells the story of a Japanese soldier stranded on an island during WWII.  Terrible things happen on the island..scary gory things that are kind of ghostly and ghoulish and otherworldly...dead and half dead creatures are involved.Questions that arise for readers are...why did his father have this book and what does Evan's retired military grandfather have to do with any of this?Evan's father and Grandfather are estranged...so much so that Evan has never even met him.  When Evan's grandfather travels to see him...eventually all of the secrets are revealed.Why I wanted to read it...I am not really sure why I read this.  The idea of it was interesting enough...but even though it was beautifully written it was not my favorite kind of book.  It was told through Evan's life and also through the words of the Japanese soldier.  It was truly haunting...the creatures on the island were...well...not good.Why you should read it, too...I am not sure I enjoyed all of this book but I did enjoy parts of it.

"The Scorpion RulesByErin BowWhat it's all about...Greta and the other Children Of Peace live in an isolated situation.  They garden, they milk goats, they make cheese, they study world affairs.  They are the children of the kings, queens and rulers of countries.  If any of these countries go to war...they are the children that are killed...the children who live together away from their families.  This is a dystopian society and this is the means they use to stay peaceful.  If Greta and the others stay alive until they are 18 they get to leave.  They go off to rule their countries.  This society is ruled by weird human like robots and discipline is key.  There are ways to keep Greta and the others under control.  They don't even think about another way of life until Elian comes along.  And then things get messy...very very messy.  And then there is the Talis ( the master of the world ) and the Wing Riders and all of the AIs...and always the threat of death that is even more prevalent for Greta because her family is the most powerful and has the most control over things...especially things like water.  And then everything changes.  Greta changes.  But I can't tell you why.Why I wanted to read it...There was lots of hype about this book everywhere and I thought that it would be a book that I would love.What made me enjoy this book...This book was good and interesting enough but I did not love it the way I thought I would at first. It was so hard to get into this book...I am not even sure why...sometimes the vocabulary was weird...sometimes the situations were difficult to read.  It was sort of a typical dystopian breakout book...mean rulers, unfair rulers, persecuted people.  There is a sort of not typical love triangle in this book too.  Greta and Xie?  Greta and Elian?  At about the 40 % mark...the book got intense and I had a difficult time putting the book down.Why you might want to read it, too...Readers who love world building dystopian books will enjoy this one...I think.

"This watch is incredibly beautiful.  The time face is really gorgeous.  It seems to have so much going on within it...it looks more complicated than it really is.  I love the black rich looking leather band.  I love the distinguished circle of red on the face.  I love that it winds when you move your wrist.  Now to the iffy and uncertain part.  Another reviewer was very frustrated with his watch.  There are no specific directions about how to get it on.  It is odd.  We called Lucien Piccard.  They were very kind and very apologetic about the clasp and we were able to follow their instructions and open it, put it on and close it.  It is a big watch but it's a fun watch.  My husband won't wear it everyday but if you are a bit of a watch collector...this is a cool one to have.  My husband has very expensive watches and this one does not look inexpensive.

"There are a LOT of 1 star reviews slamming this program because it is not true security, however I see no claim by them that it is.A vault is just a place to store something.  The password is just meant to be a minor deterrent to the casual user of your phone.I wonder if those that lost their photos really lost them or if the app just started looking in a different location and they were unable to find them or if their FAT table became corrupted, for I find it hard to believe that the writers of the software would intentionally delete any files unrelated to the app itself.All this does is rename the file name extension of your photos so that other ""photo"" viewer apps do not think that those files are photos to be viewed.I have a large variety of photos on my phone.  Kids, family, events, serial numbers, comparison shopping, documentation, articles to be viewed later.Those first three want to be seen my friends and family, but the latter do not and this allows me to easily keep those latter photos out of the Android Gallery app, but still available to me.Yes, one can easily rename the files back and forth manually, but that is a pain and this app makes it easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSGMB0K6VPVZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JJGLHO#wasThisHelpful","RSGMB0K6VPVZ9","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the light weight, long battery life and readability in daylight and the fact that my kids cannot play games on it while using it unsupervised. Tho I do wish there was a way to limit which books they can access and still have my books on it.My main disappointment however was in how many of the 200+ Kindle books I have ""are not formatted"" for the Kindle Paperwhite.On the Amazon product page for the books in question, they list compatible devices and the Paperwhite is not listed. I am talking about chapter books that are just words with 1 small picture per every other page with no words on the picture.Since this Paperwhite displays graphic content quite satisfactorily (tho a bit slowly), I am not sure why that would be the case.Before purchasing this, I assumed that Amazon would make sure that all Kindle books would display on their signature Kindle device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S77QNK3RV01F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTTJRTU#wasThisHelpful","R1S77QNK3RV01F","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is perhaps the most realistic racing game out there which makes it a lot of fun to play and pass the time.  I have tried many Android racing games, but this is the only one that has been able to hold my interest.However they make it needlessly difficult and annoying in their ploy to get you to pay real money.To date I have spent over 300 hours racing in RR3.Like everyone else, I first started with minimal money and worked my way thru the races and cars, but after a point, the cars and upgrades became too expensive and I found myself re-racing the same race way too many times trying to beat cars that were far better than mine.There are a few cheats out there, but the one I decided to use was simply copying over the saved files on my device with files that let me start fresh with a billion R$ and a billion Gold Coins.Suddenly the game became a LOT of fun as I always had the best car in the race as I was able to immediately fully upgrade every car and I did not have to wait hours for my car to be repaired in order to play again.  When I had time to play, I played, but it cost me 10 gold coins every time to expedite the repairs.When they offered a free $4,000,000 hybrid car I went back to my 1st identity because I was now able to generate a good amount of R$ and gold coins every day, but that soon fizzled out as it became too difficult to win those races and I quickly ran out of money again.So I went back to my 2nd identity with the cheat.I enjoyed racing very much for a long time.  I only raced when I had time to race and I did not find it very frustrating at all... until they suspended my account for cheating.  I was able to play after the suspension, but only for 1 day and I found myself suspended again.By the way, if they catch you cheating, it can be a bit of a hassle to clear that flag from your login.So once again, back to my 1st identity I went.Once again, I found myself racing the same races over and over again more often than I'd like and keep having to wait hours between races for my car to be repaired and I am only able to afford minimal upgrades and it takes forever to accumulate enough money to afford to buy the next car I need.Instead of playing strictly for fun, racing became a bit of a chore at times.  In short... frustrating.Again, I stopped.This time, out of curiosity, I created a new 3rd identity starting from scratch.Starting a new game gives you a slightly different interface.  The most telling is that my 3rd identity can only repair 3 cars at a time and the 2nd repair man cost be 10 gold coins and the 3rd one cost me 50 gold coins.  Before now, there was no concept of a limited number of repair men.  I have very frequently had more than 3 cars being repaired at the same time before now, so this is a big drawback to starting anew.I decided to go back to my 1st identity to get this new F14-T.  Maybe it will allow me to generate enough gold to stay afloat.----Note that it is a HUGE program (over 2GB) and after you perform the initial install, it will want to connect to a wifi connection to install the rest (it does allow you to use your 4G signal if you want).  There is a button to force it to download everything at once and it puts that 2GB by default onto your external MicroSD Card which is nice.My tips:I spent $5 on the starter pack to pay the developers for their time and another $4 to VIP a car to get rid of the pop up advertisements - with only some success - it does lessen the ads for a time, but before too long, you are back to ads.I would suggest starting with the attitude that you will NEVER pay to speed things up and NEVER part with a gold coin when there is a R$ option. This strategy will take you a long way towards minimizing your cost.My identity with the cheat has every single car and fully upgraded, but for those that do not wish to cheat and risk being banned, I found that nearly all of the cars that cost a lot of gold are not really necessary. You can get to 75% without them and 100% of all the other series.In fact, to get from 75% to 100%, the most you will gain is about 30 gold coins and spending more than 30 gold coins to buy and upgrade a car in order to achieve 100% makes no sense.If you start out without much money, know that you will often race some of the races over and over again until the game finally gives you opponents you can beat, but you can keep progressing. It is just more time consuming.The cost to fully upgrade is generally more than the initial purchase price of the car.I seldom get that last upgrade or two for each category as it generally costs a lot of gold and does not make a huge difference and seldom will the payout cover the cost for that last upgrade.Cars I only plan on racing in their respective Showcase to get the 100% bonus only get 1 tier of upgrades, while most other cars get 2 or 3 levels of upgrades (depending on what I can afford and the cost/benefit ratio).I upgrade every car when I first purchase it, before I race it at all. Might as well have it upgraded while you wait for it to be delivered.On of my goals has been to collect as many gold coins as possible and then convert them to Racing$ in large amounts. Every time you win a race that rewards the most you have ever won so far and you think you can easily get first place every time, then remember that race and choose it for your morning daily 100% Bonus Race and pay the Manager a gold coin to double your earnings (and for 2 races I pay the Agent as well). Normally gold coins have a rough value of R$3,000 to R$5,000, however, using this trick, you can easily convert a single gold coin to anywhere between $10,000 to $650,000, depending on the race.When you find a race that has a large payout and you want to rerace again and again (like the last races in Endurance Kings or Classic Ferrari Showdown) you probably want to win 1st place by as small a margin as you are comfortable with (I shoot for 200 yards) otherwise it quickly gets more and more difficult to win 1st place. If it becomes difficult to win, just race to lose big time a few times to reset it.As you progress, the prizes barely increase, but the costs of the cars and the upgrades balloon exponentially. The prices of the cars may be in line with reality, however you really have to spend a lot of time playing the game to earn enough money to afford them.  They have special races now tho that give you one of these cars for free... very nice.I planned ahead which cars I wanted ahead of time so I knew when to buy or skip a car on the spot and how much I want to spend upgrading it. You want to know ahead of time because you will generally be offered a 20% and occasionally a 40% discount to buy a car right then and there.I created a table here to help decide which cars were worth buying and which I would skip.  rr3. wikia. com /wiki/User_blog:ChicagoCPA/List_of_Races_and_CarsAs you win R$, you will be reminded left and right that you have enough R$ to buy another car and you need to realize that you want to always say no because if you wanted it, you would have purchased it when it became unlocked at that 20% discount.There are gold bonuses for reaching 25%, 50% 75%, 100% completion of a series plus there over 1,000 gold collecting levels with 10 to 100 gold coins per level.However, as you increase your level, you will find that it takes more and more fame points to advance to the next level.  You start out with 1,000 fame points per gold coin, but I am currently at a point (level 125 which pays 28 gold coins for about 170,000 fame points) that it takes about 6,000 fame points per gold coin.  At the moment, there are only 2 races that give you over 15,000 fame points for a win so paying the agent to double it rarely pays off any more.Know that if you DO have a ton of Gold Coins burning a hole in your pocket, you will often have a chance to unlock and buy a car ahead of time, which can make it a LOT easier to win races, but they generally charge you a significant premium to do so. You can also skip some series all together to more quickly get to the ""fast"" cars this way. With the billionaire identity, I would periodically browse all the cars in the Add a Car section to see if I could buy one early. Buying one often immediately releases another car and will also release the series that they are in.Pay attention to braking distance. You can lose a lot of time by not stopping in time and skidding out on a turn.Pay attention to acceleration when picking a car as it helps a lot if you can pass everyone when you first start the race.Acceleration also helps a lot because there are a lot of turns and the faster you can get back up to speed after each turn, the more likely you can win.Pay attention to Grip. If you learn how to maximize its usage it can make a big difference.When you have accumulated several cars thru several racing series, you can go back to win more $/G while you are waiting for your main car to be repaired/delivered/upgraded.Going off the track will wear down your car faster, so if there is no need to do so, don't. However cutting certain sharp turns to pass is by far the easiest way to get ahead and what good is saving R$ if you do not get a medal.Using going off track to brake is also a difficult to master tool when you find yourself heading into a turn going way too fast.Steering assistance will really slow you down a lot if you go off-road, so turn that off as soon as you can.Also turn off braking assistance as soon as possible.I have won 1st place in over 100 races without any assists (there is an achievement reward for that), however I still generally race with traction control on.There are a number of achievement rewards that are worth doing just for the fun of it, like winning the race by going backwards over the finish line.The time trials do not pay out much, so I generally run them with a car severely in need of repair and as slow as necessary to not have to worry about going off track.Playing without a gas pedal can be less stressful on your wrists and your device, however there are many, many times when coasting will give you much better control than constantly accel/braking will.Too bad they do not have a graduated gas or brake pedal. Even with coasting it is hard to maintain a speed less than your maximum when you are asked to not hit the car in front of you.Another way to make it a bit easier is to pay attention to the stats when you first start a race or the video of your opponents...RR3 will choose different opponents depending if you are on-line or not. If I do not like my odds, I will go back to the main screen and turn off my antennae and go back into the race and see if it chose easier to beat opponents. Endurance, Speed Record, Speed Snap and Autocross will often be an easier 1st place win your first try if you start it off-line.RR3 will usually, but not always, gradually make it easier for you each time you race the same race until you can eventually win 1st place.I often deliberately loose right away on the Elimination races to conserve my car and let the game remove the really fast car from the race the next time around.I frequently quit races before the finish line if I make a lot of mistakes and do not think I will achieved the position wanted (1st, 2nd or 3rd) to save time and conserve repair status to try again with different opponents.Remember to accumulate enough R$ and Gold before you need it because it is better to have a lot in hand when that discount window shows up. For the standard 20% discounts, you can generally tell how soon it will appear by clicking on the lock button to see how many races you have left before you are presented with that opportunity.Pay attention to the markings on the curbs, walls, buildings, posts as you will often find a cue to let you know when to start braking so that you do not skid out on the next turn, which costs you dearly. It may take a few runs to figure it out.Another trick is to save your progress on-line before starting a difficult race and do a restore if you made too many mistakes. One can even hack those 3 Drive bars for the time trials by doing so. You can keep restoring it and RR3 remembers your results on-line anyway. I never saw a need to buy more than 3 as they are needlessly expensive.One trick that does not work is changing your device's date/time stamp.  It will reset your daily bonus back to 20%.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8MK3MXN4HQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJQKQH6#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8MK3MXN4HQN","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Samsung S4 in a OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black and the belt clip broke.It was not a huge loss as I was never enamored with the OtterBox clip.  I Love the protection of the Defender case, but the clip kept coming off my belt... the opposite of protecting my phone... and catching on things until it finally broke.I purchased this Kuteck pouch clip to replace it and the Otterbox Defender case fits perfectly. Not too loose, not too tight.  I thread my belt thru the 3 loops in the back so I never have to worry anymore about the entire thing coming off my belt.The magnet could be a little bit stronger, but it is strong enough to do its job.The one thing odd about it is that the loops at are the bottom instead of at the top.  Instead of hanging down from your belt, they are held up.  It seems instinctively wrong, however the loops are tight so it does not flip over, but it does tilt out just enough to make it easier to put your phone in and out of the pouch.The pen is useless and pointless.  If there were a place to put it in the pouch, I might carry it around, but there isn't so I don't.Update: I have now been using it every day for 7 months and it still seems well constructed and it fits all of my belts.  If it does come apart, I would probably purchase another one and so far, I have yet to have my phone fall out.  It is has been easy to get the phone in and out of this holster.S IV S 4","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFHRA88D9WCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOFZ1W2#wasThisHelpful","RRFHRA88D9WCJ","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tetra 3i is a bit noisy, but tolerable. I picked it up at Petsmart after our daughter ""won"" a goldfish at a charity function.It works and there are not a lot of other options small enough to fit in a fish bowl.The suction cups on the side have held up well attached to the inside of our round bowl and it does not take up that much space inside the bowl (compared to other filters) and we did not want to purchase a full fledged fish tank for a fish that would likely die in a week.We have had it running for 9 months now.After about 6 months, even after changing the filter and clipping the ends of the tube to get a tighter fit, the water flow kept getting less and less until finally I purchased the 10 gallon Tetra Whisper Air Pump.I can now keep the lip a bit higher over the water and the flow is strong enough to get a lot more use out of the filter and if it clogs up, it is strong enough to keep on flowing thus oxygenating the water, unlike the old motor, which nearly suffocated my fish.  The water flowing around the filter may not be filtered, but at least it is being oxygenated.With both motors, I hung the motor about a foot above the top of the fishtank (on a hook) to avoid water getting to the motor.With the original filter, I had to constantly change filters to keep the water flowing. I do try to clean the filter most days, but I still have to replace the filter about once a week. I wound up getting the 6 pack Tetra 19550 6-Pack Whisper Aquarium Filter Cartridge, Small.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLAVCSH0JCZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HHQ712#wasThisHelpful","RKLAVCSH0JCZE","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It comes with 2 CAT5 cables.I have a gigabit network at home and I routinely transfer files between my computers at 100 MB/s (800 mbps).The one place I am missing such speed is the 2nd floor where the bedrooms are, and I was hoping that I could fix that problem with this device without having to feed a CAT6 cable thru the walls, but alas this fell far short of what I was hoping.I tested it in steps.I first connected my notebook directly to my switch with a CAT6 cable and I successfully transferred a movie file at 100 MB/s.Next I put that same CAT6 cable into one of these adaptors and then plugged it into an outlet and plugged another CAT6 cable into the other adaptor and plugged that into THE SAME OUTLET and pushed the link button on both adaptors and then plugged that 2nd CAT6 cable into my notebook. Transfer rate = 25 MB/s. Far short of the 50 MB/s I was hoping for, but not too shabby.Next I plugged that 2nd adaptor into another outlet on the other side of my house (built in 1946 in Chicago, so the wiring is a bit old) but on the same circuit breaker and the transfer rate dropped to 5 MB/s. Not acceptable.Next I tried plugging that 2nd adaptor into an outlet in our 2nd floor bedroom and no matter what I tried... no connection at all. But it is on a different circuit breaker.Looks like I will have to pull a CAT6 cable to the 2nd floor if I want better transfer speeds upstairs.

" 0:21 MinsI wanted to post a photo to show what you actually receive, but I guess a video will do (odd that Amazon removed photos).In an envelope, I received 5 blister packs just as if I went to the hard ware store and picked 5 off the shelf.  They are they rubber style that expands to make a tight fit with the sandpaper when you tighten the screw (and allows you to remove it by loosening the screw.I too wanted to use it to trim my dog's toenails and it worked like a charm.  I have bad memories of trying to use a clipper 30 years ago and have never tried again since.  Sanding them down is the way to go, however the odor was unexpectedly nasty.  I am glad I did it when the wife was not at home.  You would also need a towel as it can make a mess.Now that I have them and see what they are, I probably should have just gone to the hardware store and picked up just one of these and a pack of sandpaper Dremel 408 1/2-Inch Sander Bands, Coarse, 6 PackAbout the only way I would foresee needing 5 of them is if I had a project where I wanted 5 different sandpaper grits to be handy at all times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4QVKAEIMTS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NFIXDK#wasThisHelpful","RM4QVKAEIMTS1","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This camera has been up an running for about 4 months now pointing at our back door.  It has been sending me an 3MB avi video file attached to an email every time motion is detected in the sections that I asked it to monitor as well as 2nd email without an attachment to a different email just to say that motion detection has been triggered (for a faster response time).  I am using the web-interface built into the camera for the video file and MyDLink for the other email. It is connected wirelessly.  So far, only once have I had to unplug it and plug it back in again to get it working again.  It is working exactly as it should.  MyDlink for Android has been able to access the camera just fine.  Day and Night mode both work just as expected.My reason for only 3 star lies mostly in it's fidelity.I can tell who is coming and going only because I know everyone coming thru that door so far, however if a stranger were to decide to enter, I doubt the resolution would be of very much help in identifying that person.  However, if I HAPPEN to check email when I know that no one should be home and it HAPPENED to not be a false alarm, I could call the police immediately and catch them in the act, in theory.On the flip side If it were a full HD camera, these video files would be HUGE.I get much the same effect, but Full HD, with our webcam using BlueIris, but that would need to remain within USB cable length from the computer.The other annoying factor is the motion detection sensivitity.  I am getting a lot of false positives even tho sensitivity is set currently at 25% -- mostly it is changes in sunlight intensity or the neighbor's floodlight.

"I purchased this to dose out powered aspirin for my 100lb dog and I needed to give him 900mg per feeding and no scale I had in hand (I do have a digital one that is accurate down to 1g, however rounding was a big concern).The tare functions works well.  You can tare it after you turn it on or you can put the cup on the scale before you turn the scale on and it will start up pre-tared.The ceramic cup I used weighs in at 94 grams on both scales, so I knew it was accurate enough for my needs and after 2 weeks of daily use and repeated re-weighing of the same cup, it does vary every time, but it has always been within 0.10 grams (and much of that variance could easily be moisture or oils from my hands).  I figure that as I pour in the aspirin, the relative change in weight should be far more accurate that my other scale and being off by 0.10 grams was not really an issue for me. At least now I know if I have 1.1 or 1.0 or 0.9 grams vs ""somewhere between 1.49 and 0.51"" as before.I would completely ignore that last digit for anything important.In fact, I would not use this scale for anything where accuracy of better than 0.2 grams is really important.The scale itself weighs 125 grams.  It is 5""x3""x.75"" and the raised metal is 3""x2.5"".It does g, oz, gn (grains), ct (carats).When you turn it on it also displays ozt (Troy ounces) and dwt (pennyweight), but I do not know how to access those while it is on.

"GoPed is known for their powered scooters and somehow someone put electric in the description here at Amazon, but this is just a plain manual push scooter that will likely be used by your great grandchildren after you (or your young kids) are done with.The 400 lb weight limit and beefy wide wheels (6""x2"") make it a good choice for us as my wife and I are over 200 lbs and live in Chicago, where the sidewalks and parks are full of uneven pavement.  6"" = 152mm.  Our other scooter has 200mm wheels.  Bigger is better for not injuring yourself on larger cracks.  Smaller is better for portability.  Though 6"" is larger than many other folding scooters, I still have had this come to a sudden stop (once).This scooter seemed to be about the only foldable/portable scooter available that we felt was sturdy enough to handle 200+lb adults riding on it for a quick run to the corner Walgreens or keeping up with our kids during our scooter/bike rides without fear of it breaking or catapulting us head over heals at every raised sidewalk edge.  Not having the folding mechanism behind the front wheel, having a solid frame between the two wheels, makes it feel much more sturdy than other folding scooters I have tried.Dual brakes is nice.  A touch more braking power than the rear brake alone.  Especially if you happen to be caught in wet conditions and the rear brake becomes useless.The wide deck makes it much easer to stand with both feet on the deck as you switch feet.Ordering it from Amazon is considerably cheaper (when you include shipping) than getting it directly from GoPed.The top of the handlebars to the top of the deck is 35 inches and the top of the deck to the floor is 3.5""It is a comfortable height for my 6' tall frame.The deck is a about 1 inch higher compared to others so it requires a slightly deeper knee bend to push off.It is also about 1 inch more clearance. The extra height does make it less likely to bottom out as you ride over raised sidewalk cracks.It folds nicely (just pull up on the spring loaded sleeve) and mine came with a black nylon strap that wraps around the rear fender to keep it folded.Also nice is that they sell directly from their website, every single part on it, should something need replaced.I wish it had:- an option for a kickstand, but I see a couple of interesting options on eBay.- 8""x2"" wheels to better overcome the larger cracks in the sidewalk (think tree roots pushing up the side of 1 slab)- a deck that was about 1 inch lower without reducing the clearance or the weight limit or increasing the cost (yes I think it is very possible with just a deck redesign.)- somewhere that I can thread a standard bicycle loop-ended cable or heavy duty chain to lock it up on the street.  You can use a U lock behind the front wheel and a very thin cable would fit between spokes in the wheels.<Update: I just rode it to work this morning.  A 10 mile commute and it took 100 minutes including lights and a couple of rest breaks.  It was actually less tiring than riding the bike, which takes 60 minutes with the same unassisted effort.  It is now sitting in my office under a couple of chairs and you would never know it was there.Tho I did use my biking fingerless gloves, I still failed to keep my hands closer to the stem, so I have a blister starting in my palm where the end of the handlebar was digging into my hand.  I need to learn to fight my instinct to seek better steering control by moving my hands out away from the stem.The deck height issue turned out to be a non-issue.  I did not do a deep knee bend on every single kickoff, rather for each knee bend, keeping my body still, I used five to ten pendulum style kickoffs on one side, then switched feet and repeated followed by 2 feet on deck coasting for a while and repeat, thus cutting the number of knee bends considerably.I cannot imagine doing that with a narrower deck. I never tried to ""center"" my feet.  During the entire trip, my feet never crossed or touched the center line.  I simply kept my foot where it was during the 2 footed coasting effort.  Less effort that way I figured and it worked well.Unlike biking without a motor, there was no sign of knee pain or saddle sores.This scooter held up well and not once did I encounter a sudden stop due to a crack in the sidewalk, tho my taking a bike path between the cars and parked cars for 90% of the distance help there a lot.  Did not have to worry about getting a flat.  No chain to get my pants or hands dirty.Did not have to bring tools or spare parts to fix anything.  Did not have to bring heavy chains and locks.  Did not have to spend time locking it up.  As I passed Home Depot, I realized how easy it would have been to simply stop at any store along the route.  Much easier than it would have been had I ridden my bike. Saw more than I usually saw since I was going 1/2 the speed.  Rode the entire distance with my backpack on the handlebars strapped tight as they would go with the sternum strap also as tight as it would go.Shared a cab with co-worker on the way to a meeting on my way home and had no problem putting this and my backpack between my legs and wound up with a conversation starter.Got tired on the way home, hopped a train in the middle of rush hour (no bikes allowed then) and the conductor had no issues with my tucking this and my backpack between my legs on a crowded train.Nice.  Other than it seemly taking forever to get anywhere (compared to biking with a motor) and a blister, I encountered pretty much no negatives, all positives.>","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4JIRWRDFZG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F9KHX4#wasThisHelpful","RR4JIRWRDFZG8","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had this pen in my front pants pocket with my keys every day for about 3 years now and it is small enough that I never even notice that it is in there.This pen does not write as smoothly as any of my pens in my desk, but it does write very acceptably in nearly every scenerio I have wanted it to and has never failed me yet. It has never leaked.  It has gone thru the washer/dryer and still works afterwards and it did not create any ink stains. Would I be willing to carry any other pen in my pocket at all times on the chance that I may leave it in my pocket to be washed?I have never been able to say any of this about any other pen.In storage mode, it is small at 3 3/4"" x 3/8"" with an extra 1/8"" width for the clip, so it fits nicely in the zippered pocket in my phone holser.In the writing position it is 6 3/8"" long and respectably thick.  It feels like any other normal pen and has a nice weight/balance to it.I do wish it had a flat side because it rolls away quite easily and the clip (my first one came with a clip) will get lost quickly because it just slides right off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QQAZ5VH6ORV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000095K9D#wasThisHelpful","R27QQAZ5VH6ORV","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine came with a 5v 0.7 amp wall wart with a 5' cord and micro USB end. It also came with a clear plastic case for carrying the fully charged battery around protecting the battery.Having a separate charger means being able to charge the dead battery later and without having to remove the protective case and backing to do a 2nd battery swap in order to charge it within the phone.So far, I do not see a difference between using the 2 amp charger that came with my S4 and the 0.7 amp charger that comes with this box.  Either way, it seems to take about 2 hours to fully charge my battery. It is difficult to remember to keep an eye on the unit to tell when it turns green to be certain however.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VR4DPUBENA18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW0XZO0#wasThisHelpful","R2VR4DPUBENA18","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, I have received 2 MHL 1.0 EPL-3FHUBE adaptors inside a MHL 2.0 ET-H10FAUWEGWW box (via ebay) and 2 MHL 2.0 adaptors that have both worked beautifully (at least until I broke my first one).  All of them came with a snap-on ferrite core to reduce magnetic/electrical interference.I have tried both the ET-H10FAUWEGWW (via ebay) and ET-H10FAUWESTA (via Samsung's website) and both of them have the same model number stamped on the unit itself and use the same UPC/EAN#: 8806085519558.The box from Samsung has a holographic sticker on it that none of the others had, saying Samsung Original Mobile Enhancement and it was the only one without a plastic tray.With my Samsung S4, I am getting crystal clear 1920x1080 60Hz edge to edge display (with no over/under scan) on my home made 15.6"" 1920x1080 monitor as well as our Samsung TV set via an HDMI cable.HDMI to DVI has been a particularly difficult challenge with MHL 1.0.  However with this MHL 2.0 adaptor, I am getting the same 1920x1080 60Hz signal on both my Flatron W2246 and Dell U2212HM.I can also listen to the sound via the phone's headphone jack while it is plugged in (since monitors do not have speakers).I have not needed to provide power to the adaptor.  There is a micro usb port for power, but I have not needed to use it (unless I want to charge my phone).Nowhere on the box does it specifically say it is for MHL 2.0, but the description on various websites say that this is the main reason for this adapter's existance.Note that it is designed for Samsung's 11pin micro MHL 2.0 pin configuration, which I do believe that no one else is using yet.  Which means it is for the Samsung Note II, S3 and S4 and that is about it right now. Only the S4 however will utilize the MHL 2.0 aspects of this adaptor. With the Note II and S3 it is supposed to behave just like the MHL 1.0 adapters that have been out for a few years now.I have been on a quest since I first got my HTC Droid DNA to have an Android Phone project a 1920x1080 image onto portable monitor for remote desktopping so that I can stop carting around my very heavy, very expensive (please do not steal this if I leave it in a hotel room or the car while on vacation) notebook computer.Turns out the HTC Droid DNA was not quite capable of this, so I got the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the SmartDock.  Turns out that the SmartDock would also not spit out a 1080p signal to a monitor.With this adapter, I finally have my solution.  A pocket sized thin remote computer subsidized every two years by Verizon.One downside is that I had to tweak my Otterbox case for the plug to fit as it is wider than any other MicroUSB plug I have seen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8R5HBLQQURU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTCPQ5C#wasThisHelpful","R2L8R5HBLQQURU","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard first hand and read many a tale of phones that survived significant falls due to this case and I did not want to pay for insurance any more (especially now that I have multiple android phones available as backups) so I decided to give this a try.The two plastic pieces snap together nicely and come apart well (lift at the tabs).The rubber that wraps around these two plastic pieces seems to be a very good material and should last a long time and should have no problem with being removed and replaced many many times.  Plus it make the phone feel good and non-slippery in hand as you use it.The clear screen protector was okay, but I did eventually remove it and the double sided tape that held it into place came off quite well with little to no residue.  I put on a Steinheil Spigen SGP Ultra Crystal screen protector instead.  There are many advantages to having a screen protector of the highest quality and physically attached to the screen, but the biggest one is that should the screen crack, it will still be usable.  My wife dropped her phone and was able to use it just fine for months with a very cracked screen.  It is now our daily alarm clock.I had to shave and round off and the prongs at the bottom around the USB port so that it would fit into my modified SmartDock, which also has 3 parts removed so that I do not have to take off the case for either my S4 or my wife's Note II.  Well, I have to take the rubber part off of this case, but that is no real issue.  It was also required for the MHL 2.0's rather large MicroUSB plug to fit without removing the case.I am generally afraid to handle my phone without this protector on and with it on, I feel I can use my phone all I want without fear.The belt clip fits well and does not seem like it would break or slide off as easily as past ones have for me.  Update: It has slid off a couple of times these past few months, however the phone is none the worse and I have a tracker enabled should I discover it missing.One negative is that I can never feel it vibrate (keep reading for an update on this point)Another is that the clip is uncomfortable when I do not have a shirt tucked in.Another negative is that, while the clip allows you to stand it up in landscape mode, it is at too sharp an angle (about 85 degrees I'd say... I think 60 to 75 degrees may be better)After getting this Case, I purchased the Samsung EP-CI950IBUSTA Wireless Charging Cover and found that this case does not work well with the thickness of the new back cover.  I finally got it to snap together by removing the inner lining of the plastic case for the back of the phone.The unexpected bonus of the tight fit is that I can now fell the S4 vibration alarm when using the Otterbox case. Very nice side effect.Overall, now 5 months later, I am very pleased with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKHVLTREZPR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C96CMDG#wasThisHelpful","RUKHVLTREZPR6","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: The most recent update being pushed by all carriers, including Verizon, now allows MoveApptoSD.  The 16GB internal limit is not as much as a big deal anymore.  Also, Verizon now sells the 32GB version.If you are reading this, you are likely debating between this and the HTC Droid DNA and the Note II (the only three 4 core phones currently available on Verizon).  I have used all three and like all three for different reasons.  I like the pen on the Note II and my wife is completely in love with hers, but I would never use one.  It is just too big and it is not 1920x1080.  My reason for switching from the DNA to the S4 is so esoteric, I am not sure it really applies to 99% of the people that are purchasing phones.  I really do like my DNA.  In many ways, I much prefer it to the S4.My Phone History: I am coming from a HTC Droid DNA and it is generally the same size, so I have no problems at all with the size.  I just cannot see myself carrying a Note II sized Otterbox on my belt.  Before now, all of our previous 6 phones have been HTC smart-phones.Speed: After having the DNA for 6 months, I can already tell you that you will quickly get used to having a 4 core processor and any old single core phone you pick up later will seem irritatingly slow.  The S4 is theoretically faster than the DNA, but in reality I do not really notice a difference in day to day usage.Display: Like the DNA, it has a FHD 1920x1080 display and I have pretty much stopped using anyone else's computer to browse the web when I visit them or even using my own notebook.  Watching movies directly on the phone is a bit mesmerizing.  You see so much detail, you kinda forget that you are watching a 5"" screen.Screen Rotation: I find the S4 to be far less responsive to noticing that I changed the orientation from Portrait to Landscape than my HTC DNA and it annoys me no end.Tiny Fonts: Some would have issues with the tiny default fonts, however I like very much being able to see more information on the screen at once and I find it very readable and easy to zoom in whenever I want to make it a bit easier to read (or ensure I am clicking the correct box).Dedicated Menu Button: I do prefer having the menu button as a separate button because so many apps do not integrate so very well the 3 dot icon that appears when a phone does not have a dedicated menu button and the DNA equivalent of the active/recently used apps menu is just as easily reached via the long press on the home button on the S4.  The long press of the home button on the DNA takes you to the new Google Now.Touchwiz: The Samsung software will take time for me to get comfortable with. I have been using HTC phones for many years now and I did like their tweaks to stock Android.  Eventually I hope to get use to Touchwiz, but for now, it is a bit frustrating trying to work with an Android phone they way I am accustomed to.  Many of the screens are still a bit cartoonish compared to the more professional looking HTC equivalents.Web Browser: HTC has auto-text-re-flow when you pinch to zoom.  Samsung does not, but the double click seems to take you automatically to the maximum zoom you can have and still see all the text, so maybe it is just a learning curve.  I cannot get the S4 to always default to DesktopView like I was able to with the DNA, which I find very annoying.  HTC also has a cool swipe in-from-the-side way to reach all the options to remain full screen all the time.  HTC's web browser wins by a mile.Flash: I am able to view Flash content on the web just fine with FireFox (one installs the Flash apk separately directly from Adobe's website).Calendar App:  The S4 wins here easily.  Nice interface.  It includes Tasks from Exchange quite easily, however there is no TODAY button when changing the date of an appointment.Mail App:  I like both, but there is one feature HTC has that I really, really, really miss.  It remembers the folders to which you moved mail recently.  Samsung does not.  I have to scroll and scroll and scroll every single time I want to move an email.  I will likely be forced to rename my folders 01 Personal, 02 Client A, 03 Program A, etc. and keep changing them as my currently active workload demands.Folders:  Another feature that HTC has that I miss is that when you add an app to a folder of apps (e.g. Games A-F) it will automatically hide the icons for any apps that are already in that folder.  Samsung will not and will gladly let you add the same app icon again and again every time you did not realize it was already in there.Clock: On an HTC, which you click on a HTC Clock home screen widget, you are brought to the clock app so you can set the alarm or start a timer.  Samsung's Clock does nothing.  You need to create a 2nd static icon just to get to those options.  Quite odd in my mind.  Quite odd indeed.  However the Transparent Weather Clock apps works quite well.Build in Keyboard: The Default Samsung keyboard has a Swype style keyboard built in AND it has a dedicated number row (very very nice).  I do like the tab below the cursor to easily move the cursor to the position you want.  I am missing having the backspace delete the entire word as Swype does.  It is now a habit and causing a lot of rework.  Swype is also built in and I have just changed to it as the default.  Hopefully, one advantage of having it built in will be that it will work in all parts of the phone's interface.  On the DNA, I frequently find that the app I am currently using is not letting Swype add a space after words automatically soIwindupwiththisasamytextentered.External Keyboard: It is working fine with both my wireless USB Keyboard and my Bluetooth keyboards, however it refuses to let me keep Swype as my default on-screen keyboard when I use and external keyboard.  Very odd and very annoying.Text/Messaging: HTC's app will show the emoticon before you hit send (and they were very cool icons).  Samsung's does not (and they are rather boring and unclear anyway), so I have stopped using emoticons because I have no clue what it will actually look like and have no idea how they would be interpreted by others anyway even if I did as they are so understated and cryptic.I wish the Samsung had another feature that is on my HTC DNA... when I side swipe to get from home screen to the next home screen and I reach the end, the Samsung S4 just stops.  if the app I was looking for was to the right and not to the left of the base/middle screen, I have to rescroll past all the screens I just saw to get back to the right most screen.  On the HTC Droid DNA, they are in a loop.  Scroll to the left from the left most screen and you find yourself on the right-most screen, which I like a lot.Unique Samsung apps: I have no use for gesturing or eye-tracking or DriveMode or many of those features. However, I can foresee liking very much:The temperature gauge and barometer (accessible via the SHealth or WeatherStation apps)The IR to remote control the TV when I cannot find the Remote (have not yet tried)Smart Stay / Smart Pause (Smart Rotation is not quite working for me)S TranslatorMultiWindowSamsung HubAirView for some reason defaults to individual items turned off.  If it is ""on"" and not working, just dig deeper as there are more option underneath.  I am a big fan of the idea of AirView.  It is the one feature of the Pen on the Note II that was most tempting.  In practice however, it only worked on half of my emails and simply clicking the date in the calendar worked better and it seldom really showed enough to really help anyway.If Found Contact: There is an OwnerInfo section in Lock Screen Widgets to have your name and work phone number scroll across the lock screen, which is VERY nice should you loose it.  For HTC, I had to create a graphic backgroud file.WiFi disconnect - DLink Routers:  Apparently there is a conflict with this phone and D-Link routers.  All Verizon would tell me was to update my firmware in order to maintain a connection (or buy a new router).  However, both were already up-to-date.  It took a few days of trial and error and google searches, but I think that I finally got the S4 and my DLink Routers cooperating (Different high # fixed channels, Mixed n and g, WPA2-TKIP only)SmartDock: The #1 reason I am upgrading so soon from the DNA (after just 6 months) is to be able to use the SmartDock.  This way I can have simultaneous use of OTG (on the go USB hosting) and MHL 2.0 (to view HDMI in full HD glory on any monitor) and charging.  I found the DNA sorely lacking in this regard.  In theory I could stop carrying my notebook now and do real work via RemoteDesktopping while on the road.  For certain I can now play and video/movies (mostly Windows Media Center recordings) on a portable USB hard drive or flash memory stick projected onto any larger monitor using external speakers no problem.  However, I can only get it to output a 720p signal to my HDMI monitor, not the full 1920x1080.  Disappointed.  Fine for movies, but not so much for RemoteDesktopping.  For video at home, instead of copying files to that USB hard drive, instead I use ES File Explorer and MX Player to play any of the video/movie files on our home network onto our bedroom TV.MHL 2.0: Samsung is selling a Galaxy S4 HDTV MHL 2.0 adaptor, just not in the US yet.  I had to order one from HongKong (it is on its way).  Maybe a SmartDock2 will support MHL 2.0.  My hope it to have a 1920x1080 display on my portable HDMI FHD monitor for RemoteDesktopping.  I will just need to find a better bluetooth keyboard.Replaceable Battery: I am also really liking having the ability to carry a 2nd charged battery.  I do not actually have it in hand yet, but in all my phones prior to my DNA, I carried an extra battery around with me at all times and the extra battery I ordered comes with a charger, which will save me my old hassle of swapping out batteries a second time just to keep both charged.  The main reason I like a removable battery: I do not have to bother trying to conserver battery power.  With the HTC DNA, I was so cautious.  I usually wound up with 70% available at the end of the day, but I wanted to be on the safe side just in case.  With the S4, I can thro caution to the wind as I will have a backup available should the battery die.  But so far, I have yet to kill the battery and I only charge it at night.  The nice thing about this being a high volume phone is that you are more likely to find someone still manufacturing new batteries 4 even 8 years from now.Replaceable MicroSD Card: I found that with the HTC DNA, not having a MicroSD card made it annoyingly difficult to back up my information.  I like having a drive letter and the xtra speed when attached to the computer when the card is in a fast USB 3.0 reader.  However, for some odd reason, I cannot access the MicroSD card while it is still in the camera with its own drive letter (the tool I use to compare folders cannot understand ""camera mode"", no can any other folder comparison tool I have found so far).  With a 64GB card, it is nice to carry around with me the shows no one in our house but me wants to watch, so I can watch them on the train.Flexible back: I like the more flexible plastic back as it makes it easier to change the battery or take out the MicroSD card than it was on my previous phones.  I do not worry anymore that I might break the back.Qi charging:  Samsung sells an alternative back that enables Qi wireless charging.  I have it and it was a very tight fit to get the Otterbox case to snap together, but I removed the inner backing and that helped a lot.  It is very convenient to just lay it down on my Qi charger at night.  It is very generous as to positioning (unlike my old DNA) and as a bonus, the tight fight in my case means I can now once again feel the vibration alarm.  Samsung Galaxy S4 Wireless S Charger Kit (inductive type) - Wireless Charging Black Cover & PadNote that the defaults for storing files (such as Photos) on the SD Card are hidden within the Settings in their MyFiles app.Camera: The S4 does take better noticably pictures than the DNA during my indoor at night side by side test using default and night and HDR modes.  The S4 had richer (and still accurate) colors and more detail.High Volume Sales benefits: Unlike the DNA (or many other phones) and more like the iPhone, nearly everyone makes a version of their accessories for the Galaxy line, so I already had in hand before receiving the phone:Otterbox 77-27434 Defender Series and Holster Case for Samsung Galaxy S 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackSPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil [Ultra Crystal] Premium Crystal Clear High Definition Front Screen Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500  (yes, I remove the Otterbox screen)and soon the: Samsung Galaxy S4 Spare Battery Charger (2600mAh Battery Included)Android 4.2.2: I have been using Android 4.1 for six months now and found it a big improvement over any version prior to that and can easily see (once I fully investigate the changes) liking Android 4.2 even more.  I thought 4.2.2 had multiple login ability (work with password and home without password), but so far, I cannot find it on the S4.Accessories: It comes with the same 2amp charger and 58"" cord as the Note2 does as well as a headset with mic built in and a half charged 3.8V 9.88Wh 2600mAh battery.Samsung Account: As you set it up for the first time, it asks if you want to create or sign into a Samsung Account. There are a lot of cool options there: account.samsung.com  It may prove useful if you are new to Samsung to check out this page before you activate your phone (tho you can always create the account later).Date in Lock Screen: Before it will actually SHOW the date, you need to go to Settings/More/DateAndTime/SelectDateFormat and select any one of the date formats.I will keep tweaking and updating this review as I have previous reviews and will generally answer comments soon after you post them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36W3X409FEDMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRNW3ZI#wasThisHelpful","R36W3X409FEDMK","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 8 year old because I wanted a scooter that had large softer wheels that can easily handle the cracks in the sidewalk and would be easy for him to apply the brakes with his foot and telescoping handlebars that can adjust as he grows and can easily be taken in the car. For that purpose, I found this scooter with its soft 200mm (7/8"") wheels to be the best option out there.My only negative is that, as an adult, I found that the front folding assembly is a bit too loose for my tastes for any long distance riding.  I strongly suspect all those bolts will not be able to handle the stress (as another reviewer has already pointed out, they did fail on him).It rides fairly low.  The good part of that is that it will not be as tiring to repeatedly push off as you ride.  The bad part is that you will scrape the bottom as you come across a section of sidewalk pushed up by tree roots.  For a 70lb child, this will likely not be too much of a problem.  For a 200lbs adult, it may shorten its life considerably.I had no issues with riding it with my 8 year old on my foot holding onto the handlebars, which means that it can handle 270 lbs at a fairly brisk speed without breaking a sweat.  It will likely not last as long and there is probably a 50% increased chance that the folding pins will break, but it did not show any real signs of duress as we were riding it.  The company told me that they are currently working with their suppliers on a design that will support over 250lbs.  The stated max on this scooter is 220lbs and they have no other model that is designed to support more weight.  Now that I have spent some time on this one, I will likely get the 400lbs limit bullet-proof Know-Ped for myself with its much larger deck.To be fair, I should point out all parts are easily replaceable and you can likely make this scooter last forever.  My bicycle is over 25 years old now with over 40,000 miles on it, but almost nothing except the frame is original to the bike that I purchased, so this philosophy is right up my alley.To fold, there are two pins with springs that are pushed in simultaneously as well as a folding locking arm (as you would find on a quick release tire on a bicycle). (Update - 2 years later, it no longer folds).The handles can also be pulled out of the stem.  This is how it arrives in fact.  I suppose it saves a bit of space, but I'd rather see a 1 piece T for better longevity and rigidity.There is also one ""ball"" style click point for the telescoping handles at full extension.  All other points are strictly controlled with the clamp and there is a groove to keep the handlebars in alignment with the wheel.My size 12 shoes fits just fine on the foot board, but a size 13 may be tight and anything over that will likely require your foot to be at an angle.Another reason I bought this one... I like having a kickstand, tho in practice we seldom used it.. :-)After 2 years, all three of my kids have used it extensively and I have even used it to make a quick run to the local Walgreens for bacon for that morning's breakfast.This was a stepping stone from a 3 wheeled micro mini from this same company to eventually riding a bicycle.  My kids were orignally fearful of going from a 3 wheeled scooter to a 2 wheeled scooter, but all agree with me now that this was the right choice.A big advantage from my perspective is that a 2 wheeled scooter helped them learn how to balance and now, just 2 years later, we went from all three not riding a bicycle without training wheels to having all three riding two wheeled bikes no problem (currently ages 7, 9, 10).  Which means that this scooter is no longer used by anyone, but I feel it was still a good decision and we will likely give it to someone so it can be put to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25R7Z3Z8K5QLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L2NBOI#wasThisHelpful","R25R7Z3Z8K5QLC","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does not seem as protective as the Sedio Active Case I had on my last phone, but it should work just fine.  Time will tell as experience has shown that I will eventually drop it onto concrete.  I am a bit reluctant to test it tho on purpose.It did push up the edges of my screen protector.  Quite annoying.  Kept pushing them back in/under and the case kept pushing it back forming a long bubble all around my phone.  I did a hatchet job trying to trim the already installed screen protector and that fixed it.  I will likely at some point buy another screen protector and trim it properly before installation.My phone does charge wirelessly with this case on.The one fault (which should be fixable with a Dremel) is that many of my micro usb cables do not fit into the gap provided by the case and I am forced to pry open the opening a bit for it to seat properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B66CC6BFGQZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD4Q574#wasThisHelpful","R1B66CC6BFGQZG","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pulled in by books 1 to 3 and loved reading them.  The concept of living in a bunker for generations was intriguing and the books were well written.But around the middle of book 4, the story started to loose it in terms of continuity and believability.  It was actually a chore to finish the series... (""oh come on... really"")... just to find out what happened.  They really needed a better independant editor.I am glad I read the entire series.It does end on a happy and optimistic note. Reading some of those reviews could lead you to believe otherwise.  I am not sure those reviewers made it past the sloppy sections to actually read the ending.I probably will read more of his books in this series, tho now that he has his million dollars, I hope he hires a better editor for the remainder.What Hugh SHOULD do is take a page from George Lucas and rework books 4 and 5 and re-release the series somehow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SJ3W3420POT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071XO8RA#wasThisHelpful","R6SJ3W3420POT","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<Update - this is the 3rd year we have put this up around the tree.  My 10 year old son set it up this year on his own.

The track is 40"" by 60"".The Hershey theme works well with the concept of little children and Christmas.There are a lot of videos on Lionel's website regarding its operation and maintanance (see comments) and this set came with a DVD as well.The cars interlock very nicely (there is a release under the couplings) and it stays on the tracks very well at high speed, forwards and backwards, and has not yet had a spot on the track where it would stop every time (i.o.w. the electricity flows well from track to track even tho we have cords running under the track to the tree and to the transformer).The smoker and whistle work well, tho we seldom bother with the smoker.There are switches under the engine to turn off the smoker and to make the train go forward only.My only two gripes are related to the transformer.  It always emits a noticable hum, so I want to be able to turn it off when not in use, however there is no off switch.  You must unplug it every time.I solved this problem by using a cheap on-off switch that goes between the plug and the outlet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HDONKX8SWZRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GM92Z4#wasThisHelpful","R3HDONKX8SWZRA","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been in one of our phones for 48 hours now and it still works like the original battery at a much lower cost.  Time will tell however how long it lasts.Update: 3 months later and now I have an interesting story to tell:I ordered this 4 pack because we have a 4 phone system and one of the phones was acting up.  It says the battery was full, but it had trouble staying connected, so I figure that it was worth trying a new battery.Less than a month after swapping out that 1 battery, the phone started acting up again and I figured that the problem must have been with the phone after all.I looked at the battery and sure enough, it was an original Panasonic battery (not this Fenzer replacement).  It was a different phone acting up.  So the problem was now definately not the phone but the battery and the new battery was fixing the phones.Today, I am 1 week short of having these batteries for 3 months and the last phone started behaving oddly yesterday and sure enough it was the only phone left with an original Panasonic battery and replacing it fixed the phone.  All four original Panasonic batteries bit the dust within 3 months of each other.It is still too early to predict how long these batteries will last. However... so far so good.  For now, I have four fully functioning phones once again for a relatively small amount of $$.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TECHCBHS5UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LHN2UC#wasThisHelpful","R33TECHCBHS5UR","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The shaving cream is soft (not as hard as the stuff I usually use), which I expected, so it makes for a decent travel shaving soap, since you do not have to spend so much effort getting enough soap on your brush to make a good about of foam.However it is not really a travel sized container, as I had imagined.  It is quite large.  However the lid does screw on tightly so I do not have to worry about leaking, so I will continue using it for travel.I have found that I prefer to just put a small amount onto my brush and then whip it into a foam in a larger empty bowl with a touch of water.  I get a mor consistant and lighter foam and use less soap that way.As far as the soap itself is concerned... I do like it... a lot, but for home use, I will stick with the 6 times cheaper bar soap I have been using (at least until I have used up the 12 bars I ordered from Amazon already... I like using it as well).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2XYWIHIKJL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CLBV0I#wasThisHelpful","RO2XYWIHIKJL6","A2NJQF2UI60VGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NJQF2UI60VGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have this terrible feeling I'm going to break the screen on my phone because I just canceled the insurance on it! This temper glass iPhone case looks like exactly what I needed! It was easy to install my phone and it looks great no bubbles underneath like some screen protectors can cause! I was worried that once I got it on my phone it would look bulky but you can barely even tell it has a screen protector on it! Unfortunately I've already tried out a couple times because I'm so clumsy but twice I dropped it on the glass by accident and it has protected my glass from breaking!

"This book would be very helpful for someone who is an absolute beginner at saving money.  If you have never shopped sales, if you eat out a lot and buy a lot of convenience foods, this book will help you.However, if you already know these basic things, you aren't going to learn anything much in this book.  The ""instructional"" part of the book is only about 70 pages at the beginning [and quite a bit of that is ""introduction"" type info on her family and her history of shopping].  The rest of the book is recipes - this is really mostly a cook book, not a book on saving money.I did enjoy reading the recipes - they are quite a bizarre collection.  She has everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Thai Food to a weird hot dog stir fry and lots and lots of recipes using ramen noodles [including using those seasoning packets to flavor the food].  Most of recipes are not especially frugal [most include meat, and sometimes expensive cuts of beef or salmon - things that we literally can never afford to eat at our house].  This is quite possibly the strangest collection of recipes I've ever seen [and I am a cookbook junkie].  But I did enjoy reading the recipes and I found quite a few that I want to try with our family.I agree with other reviewers that said she's exaggerating by saying you can feed your family for $75 a week - there is just no way.  I do think this book will help you shave money off your grocery bill if you are inexperienced with frugal shopping.  But, I don't believe that you will be feeding your family for even close to $75 a week, even if you do every single thing she tells you to do.I was also annoyed that a lot of her ""tips"" and info were repeated in several places in the book.  For example, her ""tip"" to puree onions before you put them into foods so that your kids don't pick them out.  This was interesting the first time I read it.  But then, it repeats as a ""tip"" in two more places.  There were a lot of things like that.  I had the feeling that the author did not expect anyone to actually read the whole book from cover to cover [which I did], and the book repeats itself a lot.However, this book is well written and easy to read.  It is enjoyable to read.  If you are a complete beginner to saving on groceries, this book will be great for you!  If you already do the obvious things to save money on groceries, this book isn't going to do much for you [though you might enjoy reading it anyway].  If you are a veteran frugal shopper, I recommend that you skip this book and get ""Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half with America's Cheapest Family"" by Economides.  That book is far more comprehensive and has a TON of ideas that you may never have thought of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2620OBPPPOHCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848732960#wasThisHelpful","R2620OBPPPOHCN","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is fantastic!  I am an experience gardener, living in the Southeast, and I SO wish I'd had this book 20 years ago!  So many gardening books are written for people living in other climates.  It was so wonderful to finally find a book that deals with what *I* struggle with trying to garden here in our beloved hot & humid Southeast!The first chapters on Gardening were very helpful - much of it was good, basic information that I already knew; but I still learned a lot that will help me in my garden.  I think that reading these chapters will definitely help me improve in several areas.Then the ""month by month"" section in the middle that goes through exactly what to do each month - that is *priceless*!  I'm so excited to have this information just written down plainly for me, without me having to try to adjust for my zone in my head and translate instructions meant for those in the Midwest into what I should do here down South.... this is incredibly helpful!I also loved the end section with specific information on each different plant and how it does in our area.  This was extremely helpful as well.This book is excellent - well written, fun to read, and jam packed with helpful information.  Well worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11DX4N2IP375A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604693711#wasThisHelpful","R11DX4N2IP375A","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was mostly too basic to be much use.  It is only about 150 pages, and I was disappointed by the lack of in-depth information.The first part of the book gives a history of financial collapse and talks about what could happen in the future.  Most people buying a book like this are probably already very aware of these possibilities.Then the book moves on to a chapter on Debt Reduction and gives some extremely basic advice on financial management.  You'd be much better off buying a Dave Ramsey book and following that plan.  It will give you a LOT more information.He includes a long chapter on currency, but I am at a loss after reading it as to why I'd want to bother with any foreign currencies.  The author says himself that it is hard to predict which currencies might be used if the dollar fails - and I honestly don't see people  accepting any paper money in a serious financial collapse situation.  I thought this chapter was confusing and did not make a whole lot of sense.So, basically, the first 86 pages of the book were a waste of time, in my opinion.  Then I got to the chapters that were actually helpful [barter and trade goods, bartering skills instead of stuff, safeguarding valuables, & investing in self sufficiency].  Those chapters were very helpful and well written.  I appreciated the information [and they are why this review is getting 3 stars instead of 1or 2].  But when you consider that the  entire book is only about 150 pages long - not getting anything helpful till page 87 was a bit frustrating.  I was left with the feeling that I would have been better off to google a couple of articles on this topic online for free than to pay the purchase price for this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGQ2FIVF46XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612434037#wasThisHelpful","R1LGQ2FIVF46XR","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is not nearly as good as the previous books in this series.This book is not as well written and readable as Mr. Warnock's previous books.  It doesn't flow as well.  I found it much more tedious and less enjoyable than previous books in the series.  I put it down many times and walked away, it did not hold my interest like his other books did.There are also quite a lot of editorial mistakes - the editing was not done well for this book.  [This was not a problem in previous volumes].  This bothered me a lot in a supposedly professionally done book.  For example, on page 67, there is a sentence that reads ""Put the on the chest.""  An editor should have caught such an error and corrected it.  On page 61, a sentence says ""Studies show garlic helps fight some cancers from growing.""  This isn't really proper writing.  There were many little editorial errors like this through the book, and I found it very annoying.The book is also poorly organized.  The book begins with a separate introduction for each author.  It is followed by a chapter on ""How Herbs Work"" and a section on harvesting and using herbs, dosages, et.  Then there is a part of the book that is devoted to a few specific herbs that the authors like a lot.  Each herb has its own mini-chapter.  Then there are mini-chapters on various cures for specific illnesses - broken bones, etc.  These mini-chapters are not that great - too brief to be really helpful, and confusingly organized.This book also continues with the extensive self promotion that was found in the previous books.  I really don't mind hearing about his seed business, but it really starts to be obnoxious when it is mentioned over and over and over again in almost every chapter.  I do feel like I paid for an advertisement in a lot of ways.All of this said, it is a decent primer on some basic herbalism.  I think there are much better books on the market for this; but if you know nothing about herbs, you will learn a good bit in this book, once you get past these other issues.  You would not want this to be your *only* book on herbal medicine though, it is far too superficial.I own all of this author's books, but I don't know if I'll be buying any more than come out moving forward.  The quality of this book was definitely not up to standard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IX2X25N1LMTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146211377X#wasThisHelpful","R2IX2X25N1LMTU","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this book had a lot of great information in it.  And, like the first book, it has gorgeous photography throughout.  This book is a pleasure to hold in your hands and to read - a real beauty and well written.This author is extremely knowledgeable and his books are super easy and fun to read.  They hold your interest and really educate you.  I have implemented MANY of his suggestions in this book already and plan to add many more as the seasons go on.I do agree with some other reviewers with a bit of criticism:  this book is FULL of self promotion.  While a mention or two of his previous/next book or his website would have been fine, he *constantly* mentions them.  He refers readers to other books he's written [and I own all of his books, so that worked for me, but I bet it would have annoyed me horribly if I did not own them].  He mentions his website and his rare seeds ad nauseum.. I mean seriously, in some parts he mentions it on every single page.  [Although, I gotta give the guy credit, because I guess it worked.  I now buy many of my seeds from him... lol!]  It was just a little over the top for me, though, and started to really get on my nerves.  [at one point, I felt I'd paid good money for a long string of advertisements!]I absolutely loved his information on gardening with raised beds and creating them for little or no money.  That chapter alone was worth the price of the book for me.  In general, I love his ""voice"" in these books and I really enjoy learning from him.  I really like his philosophy on life and on self sufficiency, and I find him an excellent teacher.I will continue to buy his books - just hoping for a tiny bit less self promotion in the ones that follow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMF3J26RQMTUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462113435#wasThisHelpful","RMF3J26RQMTUG","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to love this book, because I am very interested in growing a sustainable diet.  And there IS good information in this book - I think anyone reading it will pick up some helpful information.But I found this book so dry and hard to read. This is a subject that I feel passionately about - something that I can read about all day long and never get bored.  But, this book bored me.  I kept putting it down and walking away.  [I have still only managed to read about 3/4 of it after 2 months of ownership - usually I devour a book in about 2 days].  The author's writing style is very dry and very ""text book"".  I think that she is an extremely knowledgeable person, but her writing style does not allow her to convey her wealth of wisdom in a way that is enjoyable to read.The book is also organized strangely to me - for example, jumping right into ""garden maps"", without really any information on how or why one would draw these maps.  It would make more sense to me to talk about how to set up the garden and why [before drawing a map of it] - but she does not do that.  The chapter on garden maps is really just a collection of rough drawings of her own garden maps and what went where in her own garden.  I did not find this very helpful for my own situation.  In general, I felt like the book did not flow well at all - it sort of jumps around and the information is poorly organized.She LOVES worksheets.  This author would have done well as an accountant, because she is very in to the minutiae of listing things.  She provides copies of lots of different worksheets that she's created that work for her.  I found these tedious, personally, and would have preferred a broader discussion of the hows and whys of figuring out how much to grow to provide for all of your needs..  I felt like a lot of the worksheets were really just common sense things that people could work out on their own [plan around frost dates in your area, for example...].She also frequently references a gardening DVD that she did some years back [which I cannot find available on amazon - not sure if it is still around?].  I had the feeling that perhaps all of this book would have made more sense and been more easy to follow if maybe I had seen that DVD first.  It didn't work well to keep referencing the DVD and talking about the DVD, when most of her audience will not have seen the DVD.In short, this book was useful, but  not nearly as useful as I had hoped it would be.  I recommend ""The Resilient Gardener"" by Deppe as a much more useful and informative book on this subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y4W17L11UPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865717567#wasThisHelpful","R10Y4W17L11UPZ","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She spends a lot of time talking about how cute they are, etc.  This works for me, because our goats are definitely pets, not food.

"I found this book extremely useful, and I've been working on self sufficiency for many years now.I can understand some of the negative reviews - the first part of this book is a manifesto about his personal feelings on why self sufficiency is important, why we can't keep living the way we do, how we are killing the planet, etc.  A lot of time is spent in the first section trying to convince people that self sufficiency is important.  [I had already purchased the book - obviously I already agree that it is important!]  He also has some unusual opinions that are pretty strong.HOWEVER, if you get past those introductory chapters, this book is FULL of useful information.  I was impressed by the range of subjects he managed to cover and also by the depth.  I strongly disagree with other reviewers who said this book is too shallow or worthless.  I don't think they really read the book.  I found it extremely helpful.  Does it give you encyclopedic knowledge of every single self sufficiency topic?  Of course not - it isn't a 20 volume set!

"I am so glad I bought this book!I own a bunch of emergency prep books and I think this one is the most *practically* helpful one I've read.  It does not assume that you are a paranoid loner with a bunker out in Montana somewhere.  This book was written for real people with real lives and real loved ones that they care about.What I loved about it:1.  It gives specific information on every kind of emergency preparation situation you can imagine.  Seriously.  The info is very specific [what do you do to survive if someone detonates a dirty bomb near you?  How about a volcano?  Well, now I know...!]2.  It does not assume that you are willing to sacrifice every other person on the planet to save yourself.  This book tells you how to keep yourself and others safe.  In fact, the book encourages caring for the people around you - not just your family either, but neighbors and others who may need help.  [Personally, I'd much rather live in this author's post apocalyptic world than the world of many of the other survivalist authors out there.]3.  It has great information on prepping for people who may be elderly or infirm or for those who may be caring for the elderly or infirm.  You don't plan to leave Grandma and Grandpa to die when the Big One hits?  You need this book!4.  It gives very detailed, specific instructions on everything related to survival:  from all of the different ways to provide safe water to everything you ever wanted to know about alternate means of heat and cooking to how to know when to Run Away and when to Stay.  It also includes an extremely helpful section on weapons for personal protection.  This book is truly comprehensive in scope.5.  It was easy and interesting to read.  The author is a talented writer who held my attention.6.  This book has the BEST section on prepping with pets and keeping them safe that I've ever read.  I really appreciated that, it was tremendously helpful.  I don't plan to leave my dog to die if TSHTF [and I wouldn't want to be in a survival situation without her actually, she's an incredible asset].  This book really helped me figure out how to account for my dog's safety if trouble comes.  Any pet owner who feels the same would benefit from purchasing this book.7.  It gives realistic information about the government and the assistance the government is likely to provide.  It is not anti-government at all, while also being realistic that the government may not be able to act as quickly as we might like in an emergency situation.  I thought it was fair and balanced and avoided the ""tin foil hat"" theme which runs through so  many emergency prep books.The book also had some problems, which kept me from giving it 5 stars [aside from these few things, it was definitely a 5 star book]:1.  The editing was very poor.  There were errors throughout the book in spelling, grammar, and formatting that should have been caught by a good editor before it went to print.  The beginning of each section where it includes scary ""actual headlines"" about different disasters was particularly prone to editorial issues.2.  There was a lot of wasted paper.  It is a big, thick book, but the way it was put together leaves lots and lots of blank space.  If it had been formatted in a better way, it could have easily used about 2/3 the paper it uses, without all the waste.3.  It gets very repetitive in the final section on different disasters to prepare for.  Seriously - the first direction of almost every section was ""prepare your 72 hour kit"" followed by many other instructions that were exact repeats from other sections of the book.  That got a little annoying - I wish the author had just assumed you'd take the ""standard"" advice in the rest of the book and had included only information specific to each disaster in the final section.Over all I thought this book was WELL WORTH the money.  I learned a ton of new stuff and I'd already done a lot of learning, reading and prepping before I picked this book up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170XMXM6C7FBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479255815#wasThisHelpful","R170XMXM6C7FBF","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, I didn't expect much from this inexpensive E-book.  [I've ended up with a LOT of bad books that have no business being in print at this price point].I was VERY pleasantly surprised!This is a comprehensive book that gives the history of ghee, the medical benefits, the culinary benefits, how to make it yourself, and includes many wonderful recipes for using ghee.  The author wrote well, the book is easy and entertaining to read, and it really motivates you to try ghee.I enjoyed learning how to make my own ghee and I cannot wait to try these recipes she includes - there are a bunch of them and they all sound tantalizing.This book is well worth the price!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3771K2W5RXR6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB3OKD8#wasThisHelpful","R3771K2W5RXR6O","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I've gotten a little jaded about these inexpensive ebooks because I've gotten so many that were just plain terrible, but this book was worth every penny!This is a great short introduction to the Paleo diet for the uninitiated, and it includes specific advice for switching children over to this way of eating.  This is a fine ""quick start guide"" for the entire family.  It is well written and fun to read.The recipes are wonderful - I own several Paleo cookbooks at this point and I still found several new, innovative recipes that I had never seen before.  All the ones I've tried have been delicious and I can't wait to try more of them.This IS a short book - I saw one reviewer complaining that she ""wished there were more"" - but in this price range, this book is actually quite comprehensive.  There are many full length volumes available on going Paleo that include many hundreds of pages and every detail you can imagine, but that's not what this book is.  [Those books retail for many times more money than this book does, this book isn't *supposed* to be a comprehensive encyclopedia of Paleo....].For the money, this is AWESOME bang for your buck - gives you everything you need for a fast start to Paleo living for you and your whole family.  It is complete, concise and a quick read that will help you immediately get started on your way to better health and a better life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JBILGCI9ME8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD1UYS6#wasThisHelpful","R1JBILGCI9ME8O","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book frustrated me.  The plot of this book is a mess and the characters are not well done or believable.  [Mild Spoilers Below]The whole premise never made any sense - I read all the way to the end to see whether they'd explain why all these kids die when they are 19.  Nope, no explanation [by the end of the book, I swear I thought they just had them die at 19 so they could have sex at 14 and it not seem creepy].  This is a supposed post-apocalyptic world that just made no sense - never any idea given as to why the world ended, why these kids are in the situation they are in, why everyone dies so young....just nothing to make this world come together and be believable.The characters behaved in ways that were illogical and senseless.  One character repeatedly does something wrong, knowing that she will be exiled from the city and face certain death if she keeps doing it.  And it isn't anything she does consciously or for any purpose, she's just basically screwing around.  She ignores several warnings and then ends up kicked out to die.  Great.  It made no sense at all, especially given the extremely harsh world this is supposed to happen in where only the smart and strong would have a chance to survive to reproduce.  And this particular character was *supposed* to be smart and strong.Throughout the book I kept encountering characters doing things that just weren't rational - it was as if the authors had certain plot points they had arbitrarily decided must happen and they forced the characters to do stupid things that made no sense.  It really annoyed me.  It is hard to enjoy a book when you keep thinking ""Nobody would really do that in real life..."" or ""why would anyone do something so stupid?""I also don't believe that these authors have a very good grasp of how human beings are likely to behave in a real survival situation.  The premise of this book is that these kids work day in and day out non-stop for the main bad guy - doing back breaking, grueling work and handing everything over to him for a handful of basic rations.  Nobody ever thinks ""Gee, there's a lot more of us than there is of him, let's take over"".  Nobody even thinks of maybe trying to produce some food for themselves...  they just appear to be mindless robots with no human spirit of survival or any ambition of bettering their situation in any way.I agree with other reviewers who said the info in the book on which foodstuffs would have gone bad first and which would have lasted was incorrect.  Not a big deal, but just one more poorly done thing about this book.This book is sold as a ""Young Adult"" novel - given this, it really annoyed me that the authors put a fully described sex scene in the book amongst two of the young teen characters.  I thought it was inappropriate in this genre [when I read ""Young adult"" I expect something along the lines of ""Harry Potter"" or ""Percy Jackson"" not ""Shades of Gray"" - OK, it wasn't quite that graphic, but still... no sex scenes in books aimed at young readers, please!]  The whole ""romance"" was so pitifully done anyway that it was ridiculous.  We are supposed to believe that these two people who didn't like each other and barely spoke, fell madly in love and ""partnered"" for life within days of meeting each other for no apparent reason....never mind that one of the partners was supposedly mourning the death of his last partner who was killed in a horrific manner - which was supposed to be his whole driving force.  And this couldn't have happened long ago, because their child was still a baby.  Regardless, if this had been billed as a novel for adults, I would have had no problem with the badly done romance and the sex, but not in a young adult book.  I work in the maternity ward of a hospital and I see enough pregnant 13 and 14 year olds as it is - we don't need books making this seem like a romantic, wonderful thing to do.So, I think this book is really pretty terrible and I won't be reading the sequel.  It started as an interesting premise but that's about it, and the premise went nowhere.  The only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because by the end of it I did actually care about a couple of the characters, so there was some small positive in all the negative about the book.My advice:  look elsewhere for a better book!  This one is not worth your time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJK0SX8151QGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006211851X#wasThisHelpful","RJK0SX8151QGF","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book spends a lot of time telling you that you can make a lot of money working from home as a free lance writer, but really doesn't tell you how, exactly, to accomplish it.I enjoyed reading about the author's personal experience and how she decided to build her career, but after reading this book I have no more of an idea of how I would do this than I did before I read it.The book IS very readable and well written; the author is a good writer.  There were quite a few typos and errors though, which is a pet peeve of mine in a book that I paid for.

"This ""book"" is a scattered, disorganized mess.  She wrote an introduction and then strung together a whole bunch of old [separate] blog posts and added a conclusion.

"I had high hopes for this book, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I've been looking for the male equivalent of ""The Care and Keeping of You"" [which is outstanding for girls] for my Tween-aged son.  There is a shocking lack of good books on this subject for young men, in my opinion.I was very disappointed with this book.  It is intentionally ""high graphics"" - it seems like they wanted to make it look almost like a comic book.  I found the format very distracting & annoying.The topics are covered *very* superficially and in a artificially ""cool"" voice - like grown ups trying way too hard to sound like ""cool guys"".  I was really looking for straightforward, straight shooting information for my son.  I did not find it in this book.Also, depending on what type of Christian you are, the teachings in this book may conflict with your religious beliefs.  For example, the book promotes masturbation as a normal, great thing [as long as young men don't look at pornography while they do it].  It goes on to say that the Bible does not teach that masturbation is wrong.  Many Christians faiths do not share this opinion, so for a book claiming to be from a Christian perspective, I thought it was a little surprising that they took this position.  At the very least, they should have given both sides of the argument concerning this practice and encouraged young men to do more study in light of their own faith and beliefs.Over all, I thought it was a low quality book, poorly written, too superficial to be helpful, and written in a way that was annoying to have to read.  I expected better from Focus on the Family, quite honestly.I'm still looking for a great growing up guide for boys.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWTLG8MQ16X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589970608#wasThisHelpful","R2TWTLG8MQ16X9","A4FFK8M1P0Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4FFK8M1P0Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This coop is serving its purpose of giving shelter to my five bantam chickens. The coop is easy to put together. It looks nice as well. However it's not very sturdy and I can't see it lasting much more than a few years if that. If you live in the cold your going to have to seal up the cracks as the wood doesn't fit together tight.

"I was very impressed when I removed the V-Light from it's box.  It is constructed well, of all metal except for the base, finished in a nice black enamel, with strong, precise, adjustable joints and a perfectly weighted black plastic base.  The 36 white LEDs light your work brightly and evenly.  It can throw a broad swath of light across an entire desktop and it does so without any heat and with only minimal electricity - in fact, it only uses 3.5 watts!  It comes with a small, DC power supply which plugs into the base.  The power switch is located on the back of the base - it's a standard rocker switch and it works well.  You can easily adjust the height and angle of the light, almost with one finger.  The lamp shade also swivels easily and precisely so you can direct the light exactly where you want it.  And even though the height and angle adjusts easily, it stays where you set it.  It looks attractive on my desk and I'm very happy with it.The only thing that is missing is some sort of rubber feet or felt on the bottom of the base to protect your desktop surface.  I used a couple of strips of self-stick felt and that works great.  I'm surprised they didn't include rubber feet or felt in the box.Other than that, I was very impressed with this lamp.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSBYEYNUY4EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV41OJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1GSBYEYNUY4EB","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was offered a free Zoe Diva Select Olive Oil Variety Pack to review and I accepted.  It consists of one bottle of Zoe Diva Select Arbequina and one bottle of Zoe Diva Select Cornicabra Extra Virgin Olive Oils.  I tried some of each tonight with some old school Italian bread and noted my experience with each.I'll start with the Cornicabra.  It smelled fruity and tasted fresh.  The initial flavor was very fruity.  However, it had a bitter, peppery aftertaste that I did not care for.  I tried it multiple times to be certain that I was tasting what I was tasting, but the strong bitter aftertaste was definitely there every time.  I don't think this olive oil would be suitable for me.The other bottle was the Arbequina.  It offered a completely different experience.  It too, smelled and tasted fresh.  There was an initial fruity note, however, it was mild and less pronounced.  The aftertaste had a little pepper, but it lacked the strong bitter notes of the Cornicabra.  It was buttery and smooth and quite pleasant.  Needless to say, I preferred the Diva Select Arbequina hands down.Both bottles of Diva Select have dark green glass (which is protective) and both were packaged really well in a tough multi-layer cardboard box that was specially designed for shipping.  I would imagine the box could take a lot of abuse and still protect the bottles of olive oil perfectly.I will spend a little more time with the Cornicabra before I outright condemn it.  I can't imagine liking it though.  On the other hand, the Arbequina is very good.  It's hard to believe that these olive oils are both award winning and are both from the same company.  I'm going to rate the pair at three stars.  Really it really should be four stars for the Arbequina and two stars for the Cornicabra.  I think I would skip the variety pack and just order the Arbequina.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TQKLJ1W5Q2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJP09WM#wasThisHelpful","R29TQKLJ1W5Q2L","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got my Anova Precision immersion circulator a few days ago.  I decided to try it out tonight on a frozen, marinated, wild-caught, Alaskan salmon filet that I buy at Costco all the time.  The filets come individually vacuum sealed, and so I thought, perfect for sous vide cooking!  I normally make these straight from frozen in the microwave, which is 1100 watts, for 3.5 mins.  They come out okay, but I knew they could be a lot better.  So I looked up info regarding sous vide salmon cooking temperatures and times on the web, taking into consideration that I was planning on going straight from frozen into the water bath.  I decided to go with 130F for 40 minutes.  I attached the Anova Precision to a standard 4 quart stainless pot (see photos), set the temp for 130F and when the water was ready, dropped the straight-from-the-freezer, frozen salmon filet into the bath.  I didn't bother with the timer on the Anova Precision, because to me, it is difficult and clumsy to use - probably the needlessly weakest part of the otherwise super easy-to-use interface.  So I just used the timer on my phone.  As you can see from the photos, I strung a line across the pot (a lettuce tie), sort of like a clothes line, and attached it to the pot and the salmon via binder clips - worked great!  The only issue was that the salmon wanted to float, so I used a big spoon to hold the bottom of the salmon down.  Well, 40 minutes later, I removed the salmon from the water bath and opened the sealed bag directly into a dinner plate.  I used an instant read thermometer and tested the center temperature which read to 127F when I pulled it out (and it was still climbing slowly) - so I knew it was done temperature wise.  I was so happy when I put a fork in it!  It was moist, flaky, pink and delicious!  Very rich and flavorful!  A restaurant quality salmon filet in every way!  I will never microwave these again!The Anova Precision seems to be a very high quality device.  The stainless steel is thick enough as to not feel flimsy at all.  I had read that the unit operated silently, and it does, but I was surprised at just how much water the pump moved!  The water jet is pretty darn strong!  In the case of the salmon, cleanup was almost non-existant since I didn't need to sear the marinated salmon so there was no pan to clean.  Of course, the Anova and the pot were just in clean water, so although I did quickly soap up the pot, the Anova dried itself in minutes, the metal still being warm.Pro Tip: The stainless steel tube on the Anova Precision is removable for cleaning and you should clean the stainless tube, inside and out, before you use it the first time.  Mine had a very thin layer of black soot inside which is by product of the rolled stainless steel.  You couldn't actually see it, but if you slid your finger across it, your fingertip would be blackened.  I cleaned it using dish detergent and a brush that you would normally use for cleaning the inside of drinking glasses.  Also, there is a thin layer of protective plastic on the control surface that is difficult to remove as there are no tabs - you can hardly tell it's there and many people mistake it for scratches.  I used masking tape to pull up an edge and then removed the plastic easily revealing the perfect glass touch surface beneath.So my first experience with sous vide cooking using the Anova Precision turned out well and I'm a happy Anova owner!  Next up, sous vide pork chops!Update: June 23, 2015Pork Chops!So I did two boneless, 3/4"" thick Sterling Silver pork chops for dinner tonight.  I made them according to the instructions at ChefSteps(dotcom).  A quick 30 second-per-side pre-bath pan-sear right out of the fridge, then into the ziplock bags with some avocado oil for 45 minutes at 144F.  I used the water displacement method for the bagging, which worked well, but you pretty much have to stop the Anova to do it or deal with a lot of water turbulence.  That wasn't a problem, I just pressed stop on the Anova and then when they were bagged, sealed and attached to the pot via binder clips, I started it back up again.  45 minutes later, I removed them and patted them dry.  I also noted that some of the fat from the pork chops had rendered and was left with the oil in the bags.  I gave them another 30 second-per-side quick sear in the pan and served them with long grain rice and peas (yeah, rice and peas with butter! yum!)  So how did they come out?  They were easily the best pork chops I ever made at home.  Slightly pink sear to sear, moist, tender and juicy.  I don't have any photos of these, but I will try to get photos the next time I make them.  But trust me, they came out GOOD!  The sear part is definitely messy.  Lots of oil splatter.  I have to figure out a better way to do that.  I'm already seriously considering buying a Searzall.Update July 21, 2015Uploaded pics of boneless, 3/4"" Sterling Silver pork chops prepared in a similar manner to what is described above, except they were grilled to finish.  First, you see the raw pork chops, right out of the refrigerator, ready to bag.  Here's another tip, when using Ziplock type bags, always carefully fold the lip of the bag down and over before adding the raw meat.  This keeps the exterior and zipper area of the bag clean and also helps the bag stand up so you can easily insert the raw meat.  Then you see the pork chops in the water bath at 144F for 45 minutes.  The next pic shows the pork chops as they appear right after taking them out of the bags - not very appetizing!  I assure you, they are perfectly cooked, but they are literally grey on the outside.  That's okay though, I am going to add color when finishing them on the grill.  The next pic is what they look like after grilling them for approximately one minute per side on a 500~600F grill.  I then drizzled them with my own delicious spiced butter concoction.  They were excellent!  They came out moist and tender, especially good for pork chops, with just a little pink inside.  Also, grilling is definitely the way to go in order to avoid the mess and cleanup of pan frying to finish.Next up, steaks... just have to get the pics done...","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIZYS2CWV2T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKPBXM4#wasThisHelpful","RAIZYS2CWV2T1","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered a free bag of Diamond shelled California pistachios to review... so of course, I accepted!  The pistachios feel, smell and taste fresh.  The expiration date on the bag is just over a year out.  The only problem is that they are so easy to eat, they're downright dangerous!  You can just keep eating them with no work to get them out of the shell!  If you manage to put the bag down, you should refrigerate it.  Actually, you should refrigerate all nuts to keep them fresher longer as all nuts contain oils that go rancid and refrigeration will slow that process.  Note that these bags are only 6 ounces (1.5 cups), so the bags are smaller than you may expect.  However, since the nuts are shelled, there is no wasted space.  So if you have a recipe that calls for pistachios or just a hankering to put some on your ice cream or in a salad, these shelled California pistachios are a solid choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8AFZK6ZCZMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOE88I0#wasThisHelpful","R2H8AFZK6ZCZMF","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Thor - Stylish, great hand feel, great drop protection, but missing a hole to accomodate the bottom microphone.  This compromises the in-call sound quality, the speakerphone and the noise cancellation.  There are holes for the microphone and the IR remote on top.  There are holes for the headphone and the USB port on the bottom.  There is a hole for the speaker on the back.  But there is no hole for the bottom microphone which is located between the headphone and the USB port.  It is completely covered and sealed by rubber case.  I am not happy about that.  Luckily, I use a Bluetooth headset 99.9% of the time, so the covered mic doesn't affect me very much at all.  But if you don't use a headset, the missing mic hole will affect you.

"To my knowledge, I have never knowingly consumed goji berries before.  I was offered a free one pound bag and, as probably most of you would, I decided to try them out...Well, they have an interesting and unique flavor.  In fact, I'm having a very difficult time figuring out a common reference to give you for comparision.  They have a mild sweetness and a slight tang.  As these are dried goji berries, I can assure you that they are very dry... I'd say they are easily far drier than the average raisin.  In fact, the outside is kind of hard, but they are chewy with a slight grit to them (which I believe is the due to the tiny seeds contained therin).  However, they are not at all unpleasant.  Eating them straight from the bag is addicting and I have also added them to a salad, to which they added flavor and their chewy texture.  They also work well in oatmeal, in trail mixes (with nuts) and in muffins (which I haven't tried yet).  I know there are many healthful claims regarding goji berries, but I don't know if they're worth $17 or more per pound - that is your decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3Y99XQF075T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWW3LQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3E3Y99XQF075T","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan of electric shavers.  I don't shave every day, but when I do, I normally use a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, Proraso Shaving Cream and a Badger Hair Shaving Brush.  I get a close, comfortable shave and I can easily trim around my sideburns.  In the past, I tried a Philips Norelco electric shaver, but I wasn't happy with it.  It was a dry-shave only model.  The shave was not as close or as clean as a blade shave, it was impossible to use it to shave around my sideburns well - there is just no way to get a precise edge and worse than that, it wrecked my neck every time I used it.  I was recently offered a sample of the Wet/Dry Remington XF8550 to test and I thought I would give it a try.To charge the XF8550, you must place it into it's charging cradle - there is no way to plug the electric cord directly into the XF8550, so you are relying on the batteries at all times.  Luckily, the XF8550 is equipped with the more reliable lithium-ion batteries like a modern cell phone and not the older nickel-metal-hydride batteries which start losing their ability to charge significantly in short order.  The battery is rated to deliver a 50 minute runtime after a two hour charge.  I'd estimate that runtime figure is pretty accurate and if you shave every day, you can easily go a week on a single charge.  Still, the batteries are not user replacable and the lithium-ion battery will fail at some point.  So with no option to run the XF8550 in a corded mode, you are buying something that has a limited life-span... maybe a few years... maybe three or four before the battery becomes a real problem.The XF8550 is very comfortable to hold with the handle covered in a blue, hard-rubberized coating.  The power button is integrated directly into the blue rubberized coating and is placed perfectly for your thumb to operate.  There is a pop-up sideburn trimmer on the backside which is also easily deployed by your thumb.  The shaving head does pivot by maybe 10 degrees, but I wonder if it really does much of anything to keep the blades in touch with your face.Since this is a wet/dry razor, I've been using it wet.  Actually, I've been using it with the same Proraso Shaving Cream I use when I use my Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.  The shave from the Remington XF8550 has been decent.  It doesn't shave as close a blade, but it does a good job.  It doesn't wreck my neck like the Philips Norelco I tried in the past.  My only complaint is that like other electric razors I've used in the past, there is no way to shave close to long sideburns or a beard well.  I know this has an integrated trimmer, but it is just that, a trimmer - it is not meant to shave around well defined sideburns or beard.  Like other electric shavers I've tried, it's always too vague as to where the shaving edge is.Cleanup is a breeze as you can just pop off the foil assembly and rinse the Remington XF8550 off under the faucet.  Then just shake off the excess water and let it air dry.  I store mine on it's stand-up, foldable charging cradle.Overall, I like the Remington XF8550 better than other electrics I've used in the past, but don't expect as close a shave as what you would typically get from a blade.  And if you have long sideburns or a beard, you'll not be able to shave around them too well.  If you don't have a long sideburns or a beard, this may be a great razor for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IFQKWL419KSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGQR93U#wasThisHelpful","R2IFQKWL419KSK","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like jerky.  I don't eat it too often, but it's a great source of protein when travelling or as a snack every once in awhile.  I was offered a sample of this Chef's Cut Real Steak Jerky in the Variety Pack.  One of the things I noticed immediately on the label was that it claimed the jerky contained no added nitrates, other than that naturally occurring in the celery powder and sea salt.  That's a good thing since nitrates are not good for us.  The variety pack contains four types of jerky... Honey Barbeque Chicken, Original Recipe Turkey, Original Recipe Steak and Chipolte Cracked Pepper Steak.  I wrote down my impressions when I tried them, each on different days so that the favors would not affect one another.First, what I considered to be the best of the four varieties, the Honey Barbeque Chicken.  It had a nice sweet, smokey taste with the flavors of honey and spices.  There was some very mild heat.  The texture was moist, but hard.  It was lean and chewy, but not oily.  There was an aftertaste of smoke and heat.  Overall, I liked this variety and I may order more of it.Second, the Original Recipe Turkey.  It had a meaty, sweet flavor with lots of smoke and very mild heat.  The texture was somewhat moist but very hard.  It was chewy and not oily.  There was an aftertaste of mild smoke and heat.  Overall, I thought it was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.The next flavor I tried was the Original Recipe Steak.  The favor was sweet with mild spice and just a little smoke.  The texture was soft and a little dry, but very tender and easy to chew.  There was an aftertaste of pepper.  Overall, I did not like it.And finally, the Chipolte Cracked Pepper Steak which I ate just minutes before writing this review.  The taste was overpowered by strong, high heat with some sweetness.  Also present was smoke, pepper and spice.  Like the Original Recipe Steak, the texture was soft and a little dry, but very tender and easy to chew, but with pepper seeds present on the surface.  The aftertaste was that of heat and pepper.  Overall, I did not like it, but if you're into heat, you may enjoy it.So, for me, the variety pack was hit and miss.  The chicken was pretty good and the turkey was okay.  But I wasn't happy with the flavors of the steak at all even though the meat was tender.  If you're interested in this jerky, try the variety pack to see if any of it is the right jerky for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWS5YSPNULCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGWPUQA#wasThisHelpful","R2GWS5YSPNULCZ","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new flavor of Barilla pasta sauce is Bacon & Cheese.  It says so right there on the label.  The ingredients label includes ""uncured cooked bacon crumble"" as the third ingredient.  Both provolone and parmesan cheeses are also present on the label, much further down on the ingredients list, almost last in fact, but they are there.  Yet I cannot detect even a hint of bacon or cheese in the sauce.  Mind you, I like the sauce.  I like the flavor.  I just cannot dicern the taste of bacon or cheese.  It is a nicely sweet tomato sauce with a nice tang and I thoroughly enjoyed it on spaghetti and on the bread I ate with it.  To me, it was delicious.  My sister on the other hand, did not like it and said ""there is an artificial aftertaste.""  Now, my sister really doesn't like anything, so take that with a grain.  I explained to her that there is nothing artificial in the sauce and I detected no aftertaste.  My dad liked the sauce, but he also did not taste any bacon or cheese.

"So I've had this Shark Rotator TruePet Powered Lift-Away for just over a month now.  I also have two other vacuums to compare it to: my eight-year-old Dyson DC17 Animal and my very recent Eureka Airspeed (AS3008A).  Like the other vacuum cleaners I own, the Shark Rotator has some things I really like a lot and some things that I'm not thrilled with.As this is the top-of-the-line Shark, it comes with a lot of extras.  Unpacking the box was an adventure in itself.  There are A LOT of interesting items in the box.  I'm pulling things out of the box and I'm thinking, what is that?  And how does that have anything to do with this vacuum?  At one point I thought I had accidentially ordered a small R2D2 like droid.  Following the diagram, it was easy to assemble, but it was more complex than either of my two other vacuums.  This Shark Rotator has a quality finish that is actually attractive and suprising for a vacuum cleaner - but again, it is top-of-the-line.The first thing you'll notice when you turn it on for the first time are the super bright headlights.  A full array of white LEDs shine brightly from the vacuum head when using the Shark on carpets - a light that is much brighter and far more useful than the lights on any other vacuum I've seen.  You can and I have used this in an otherwise completely dark room, no problem.  It lights up all the ridges and dirt on the surface of your carpet.The second thing I noticed was how comparatively quiet it was.  Its certainly not silent by any stretch, but it is much quieter than either of my other vacuums and any other vacuum I've used or heard in the past.The power button is right on the front of the handle, which is a good place because it allows you to easily control the power to the Shark both when using it as an upright vacuum and when using the accessory hose.  I know there are times when I'm using the accessory hose and I accidentally suck something in that I don't want sucked in - well you can cut power to the vacuum quickly without having to search for the power button because its right there.Just below the power button is a lighted three-position sliding switch which is used to adjust the Shark to work on bare floors, which turns off the beater bar, and two carpet heights, low pile and high pile.  So although carpet height adjustment is not automatic like it is on my Dyson DC17, you don't have to bend over to set it like I do on my Eureka Airspeed, because the switch is right there on the handle.Also on the handle is another bright LED light which turns on and works well when you use the accessory hose.  It does a good job of lighting up corners and furniture like the areas between cushions and even walls.  The accessory hose and wand work well.  The hose is high quality and very flexible but may be a little heavier than necessary.  The main body of the Shark has space for two attachments - an ingenious combination of a crevice tool and dusting brush in one and a regular upholstery tool.  This model Shark also comes with an additional dusting brush, a motorized mini brush, a hard floor genie and a wheeled chassis for using the Shark as a full-fledged canister vacuum.  The electrically motorized mini brush attaches to the accessory hose or wand and provides a powered mini-beater bar which is good for cleaning furniture and stairs.  It works well and since it's electrically powered, it doesn't take anything away from the suction.  The hard floor genie is an accessory which combines the vacuum and a microfiber mop pad.  I have not had the opportunity to use hard floor genie so I cannot assess its effectiveness.The Shark works really well as an upright vacuum.  The swivel carpet head allows you to easily maneuver and steer the vacuum.  In addition, the carpet head is a little narrow at 12"" wide which also helps it to maneuver easily (my Dyson and Eureka are both 13.5"" wide).  The handle is smooth and shaped well allowing you both good grip and good control.  The carpet head fits easily under the threshold of most furniture, but the attached canister might get in the way of going too far under.  Ah, but luckily, the canister on this Shark detaches completely allowing you to get very far under almost any furniture - my Dyson DC17 and Eureka Airspeed can't do that.There are a few things about this Shark that I'm not thrilled with.  First, even though it comes with three smaller attachments, (and two larger ones) there is only enough space to carry two on the main upright body.  I can understand not carrying the larger ones, but there should be space for all three smaller attachments.  And second, when using the accessory hose with the Shark in its standard upright configuration, the Shark has a strong tendency to fall over.  It happened to me many times and its a pain in the butt because you have to stop what you're doing to tend to it.  I think it happens because the base of the Shark is relatively small and the hose is attached too high for the Shark to be stable when using the hose.  As a result, you really have to keep the Shark very close when using the hose or the body just falls over.  This also happens on my Eureka (for a different reason), but not on my Dyson.  Of course, if you use the Shark in the canister configuration, this is not an issue.One of the coolest things about this Shark is the dirt canister.  I know, you're thinking, the dirt canister is cool?  Really?  Well, those of you who have bagless vacuums know how disgusting it is to empty the canister and that a lot of filth sticks to the screens and grills in the cyclone area of many vacuum canisters.  Well, not on this Shark.  They designed the dirt canister in such a way that it actually separates the dirt from the cyclone area.  No more filth sticking to the cyclone grills and screens!  So of the three bagless cyclonic vacuums I own, this Shark is by far the easiest one to empty with as little fuss and drama as possible - in fact, this is the first one I can recommend to people living in an apartment.  Good job Shark!So it works well, it handles well, it lights up your dirty carpet, it has the best dirt canister design.. but I'm not totally convinced that it out cleans my Dyson or Eureka.  Don't get me wrong, it does a really good job, but I feel like the Dyson and the Eureka may do a better job on my carpets.  I'm not positive though.  Its definitely close.  Could it be a false perception because the Shark is relatively quiet?  Maybe.  I have to do a test with empty canisters, where I use one vacuum and then try another and see if the second or third picks up what the previous ones did not.  If I do that I'll update this review with the results.In summary, this Shark has some great features and abilities that neither of my other vacuums have.  That said, with all of its modules and detachments, its kind of complex as compared with the other vacuums I own.  Its not a light weight and its not inexpensive.  And although it does a great job, I'm not convinced that it does a better job than my eight-year-old Dyson DC17 or very inexpensive, but very effective (and lightweight) Eureka Airspeed (AS3008A) on carpets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JPXMSU6XW2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGVEW0Y#wasThisHelpful","R8JPXMSU6XW2R","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided with an AccU-Rate SM-310 free of charge in exchange for an honest review.And I'm glad I was asked to review the SM-310 because I was not even aware that small devices like this existed.  I am not a health nut, but I do watch what I eat.  I try to be especially aware of the ingredients in the food I eat and have been avoiding soy, trans-fat and HFCS for years.  I take certain supplements like fish oil, vitamin D and resveratrol.  Even so, I feel fortunate that my health has been excellent but I've always been curious to know if I was getting the most out of the exercise that I do.  Plus there are certain things that you just cannot measure at a yearly visit to the doctor's office.For instance, with the AccU-Rate SM-310 you can easily and accurately measure your resting heart rate in the morning when you first wake up.  For it is when you first wake that you can get the most accurate measurement of your heart rate at rest.  And your resting heart rate can provide a good indication of your overall heart health.  With the AccU-Rate SM-310, you can measure your resting heart rate in seconds and you can measure it every day if you want - just keep it by the bedside.You can also easily measure your heart rate during and after excercise.  You can literally pick up the SM-310 and slip it on your finger while walking, running, cycling, in between sets of push ups, etc. and within seconds know your current heart rate.  You can even use it when doing chores like mowing the lawn.  So you can get a fast, accurate measure of your heart rate while actually exercising, which can be difficult if not impossible to measure manually without first stopping - and even if you stop, its not easy to manually measure a 150+bpm heart rate.  But the SM-310 will accurately tell you your heart rate in seconds.  Knowing your heart rate during exercise is important as it recommended by the American Heart Association to keep your heart rate between 50% and 85% of your theoretical maximum heart rate while exercising in order to see the most health benefit.  You can easily look up your maximum theoretical heart rate on the web.  You should probably consult your doctor before starting any exercise regime.The unit itself is small, lightweight and very easy to use.  Just slip it on your fingertip and turn it on.  Within about ten seconds you'll see your current heart rate and blood oxygen saturation percentage on the large, bright, crystal clear, high contrast OLED display.  The finger well has a smooth, almost silky feel and its designed to effortlessly expand to work well with any size finger.  There is just enough spring tension to hold it comfortably and securely on your finger without any pain or pinching.  Remove your finger and within about ten seconds the SM-310 will power down automatically.  It could not be easier.The SM-310 operates on two AAA batteries, a pair of which are included.  Also included is a soft silicone protective case, a fitted canvas-like carry case which has a belt loop and velcro closure and a detachable lanyard.Overall, I like the SM-310 a lot.  It's one of those things that I wish I had for years and I think this kind of item will become more common now that the size, cost and accuracy of these devices are as good as they are today.  The AccU-Rate SM-310 is very reasonably priced and it works great.  I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKBPMDJP8MSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5P190E#wasThisHelpful","R2EKBPMDJP8MSZ","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These small treats are very tasty, especially for lovers of coconut.  But the key word here is small.  Each one of these treats weighs only half an ounce and is literally the size of a stack of six quarters - and that is not an exaggeration.  They are very good.  The taste of lightly toasted and barely sweetened coconut is delightful and they are not sweet or chewy at all - just perfect taste and texture in my opinion.  But they are such a small bite, a tease if you will.  At $21 for a pack of 24, these are almost a dollar apiece and they are not even close to being worth it - thats $21 for 12 ounces of coconut.  For my coconut fix, I purchase a pound of organic, unsweetened coconut chips for $6 or less (and I do, all the time).  For me, this pack of 24 tiny tasty treats would have to be even less than $8 for me to bite.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B58IEC04JBOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRFLH8C#wasThisHelpful","R3B58IEC04JBOK","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The XGB3 is compact, light and it feels good in the hand due to the 1/16"" rubber surround.  There is one full size USB port located under the rubber lid which you can plug your phone or other devices into to charge.  There is a micro USB port also located under the rubber lid for charging the XGB3.  The XGB3 comes with a 48"" USB to micro USB cable that you can use for charging the XGB3 or you can use it to charge your phone or device with a micro USB port, but it does not come with a charger.  You can plug the XGB3 into any powered USB port to charge - charging time will vary greatly depending on the strength of the power source.  There is a small LED near the top that pulses red when the XGB3 is charging and it turns solid green when the pack is fully charged.  In order to charge your phone or other device, you plug it in to the full size USB port and press and hold the power button on the XGB3 until the LED turns green.  The LED will turn from green to red when the capacity of the XGB3 falls below 80%.  You can turn the XGB3 off at any time by pressing and holding the power button again until the LED turns off.  Fully charged, the XGB3 is rated to deliver 3000mAh@1A - good for phones, but not so much for tablets.  Additionally, the XGB3 can act as a passthrough and charge a device while being charged itself.Due to the light weight of the pack and the 1/16"" rubber surround, it can probably survive small drops onto concrete, but I wouldn't push that too far.  NOCO touts the NEMA IP65 rating, but if you look into it, NEMA IP65 just means that the battery pack is ""dust tight"" and ""protected against low pressure water jets from any direction with limited ingress permitted.""  It does not mean that the pack is water proof or protected against impacts.  So don't think that this pack is military grade or anything close, because its not.  In order to test the water resistance, I subjected the XGB3 to running water in the sink at various angles and I also submerged it under about 4"" of water.  No water was present under the lid and the pack still worked fine.  Just keep in mind that the same result could be achieved with any battery pack and a ziplock bag.But one of the issues I have with this pack is with the lid.  The lid is made of 1/16"" rubber with an additional 1/16"" double lip that fits lightly, not snugly, into a very thin plastic opening on top.  It does not snap closed in a positive way that requires any effort to open.  In fact, the lid opens far too easliy if you carry the pack in your pocket and it would probably open in a purse as well.  When the lid opens, dust, debris, pocket lint and whatever else happens to be around will get in to the USB and micro USB ports - precisely one of the things this pack was meant to avoid.The product is way over packaged for what it is consisting of a relatively large, heavy cardboard, really high quality, printed inner box contained in a plain outer box... excess packaging which I can see no benefit for what is supposed to be a rugged battery pack.  Most other quality, compact 3000mAh battery packs are less than half the price of this NOCO XGB3.  Even discounting the issue with the poorly designed lid, if you think that the 1/16"" rubber surround, the IP65 rating and the excessive packaging are worth double the price, then by all means, this is the battery pack for you.  Personally, I would make a different choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FX0FRR1T8SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXIA#wasThisHelpful","R29FX0FRR1T8SJ","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have a Bissell Lift-Off Steam Mop, but I'm not entirely happy with it.  For one thing, it has a small leak.  But most importantly, you must keep a manual trigger depressed in order to generate steam.  That literally ties one hand behind your back when using the device.  I wanted to try this new Dirt Devil which addresses both of the issues I have with the Bissell and it does so at half the weight and half the price.The Dirt Devil 2-in-1 Versa steam mop arrives disassembled and snaps together easily and positively using springloaded, interlocking pins and grooves.  The metal handle has two segments which snap together and then that handle snaps into the steam pod.  At the other end of the steam pod you can either snap in the mop head for cleaning floors or the cleaning nozzle to use it as a steam pod to clean just about any hard surface.  There are two pegs on the handle you can use to neatly wrap the cord around like you would on a vacuum cleaner, but the cord doesn't have a plug with a locking head like you would think it should, so the end of the cord just dangles there.  Also, neither of the pegs rotate allowing you to instantly deploy the cord.  Finally, as I found out the hard way, the edges of those pegs are much sharper than they need to be and one of them cut my finger.  The power cord ends in a standard two-prong polarized plug and the cord itself is sixteen feet long - so it allows plenty of range from an electrical outlet.  The Dirt Devil 2-in-1 Versa comes with a small, well designed filler cup, two washable microfiber mop covers and a ""carpet glide"" attachment.This seems like a good time to mention that I think the instruction manual sucks.  It is of the multi-fold, mixed language variety, but with all of the languages mixed under each topic instead of having individual sections for each language.  So you must wade through paragraphs of the wrong language to get to the next section in the language you're looking for.  Not that there is a lot of documentation, but I like to know all the details before I start using something.  Also, there's no mention of the ""carpet glide"" attachment until the end so at first you may be wondering what it's for - it's not even mentioned on the inventory list.Using the Dirt Devil as a mop, I attached the mop head with a microfiber mop pad, I filled the reservoir with filtered tap water and flipped it on.  Unlike the Bissell Lift-Off Steam Mop, there is no trigger that you have to keep pressing for the unit to generate steam - once you switch it on, you're ready to go.  After about ten seconds, the unit started to put out a woosh of steam and I started cleaning.  Along with the light weight, one of the things I liked is the rotating mop head which sort of automatically rotates to hug walls and corners.  Using slow, steady strokes, I was able to clean my entire kitchen floor on one tank of water - the mop pad was filthy and I was happy.  I found the handle comfortable and the whole process was quick and easy.  A word of advice - never leave the mop in one spot for too long - depending on the type of floor, you could get a water spot on wood or you could literally alter the surface of linoleum.  If you need to stop, be sure to turn it off and let it cool before letting it stand.I detached the mop head and the handle, attached the cleaning nozzle and refilled the tank.  I cleaned my stove top, dishwasher door and microwave inside and out.  It worked great.  The 1200 watt steam pod generated steam fairly steadily with some pauses, but it was steady overall.  When the tank runs out, the unit starts to vibrate.  I switched it off and refilled the tank with water as necessary.  Even after a few hours of steady usage, the steam pod never got hot to the touch, which I appreciated, and I detected no water leaks.  For me, that is a solid design.I did some unscientific steam temperature testing using my Polder and Weber digital probe thermometers.  The room temperature was approxmiately 75 degrees Fahrenheit (F).  I found that the steam exiting the very tip of the Dirt Devil cleaning nozzle was approximately 205~210F.  At one inch away, that steam temperature expectedly dropped quickly to approximately 165~170F.  And at two inches away, the steam temperature was measured to be approximately 140~145F.  This is important to note as temperature recommendations range widely for killing bacteria, but from the research I've done, the recommendations fall between 160F to over 300F.  The effectiveness of steam in killing bacteria depends on the strain(s) of bacteria involved, the type of surface, the temperature of the steam, the pressure of the steam, and the duration of exposure to the steam.  Generally speaking, the higher the temperature and pressure of the steam and the longer the exposure time, the better.  At 205 to 210F, this Dirt Devil falls towards the bottom of the acceptable range (IMO) and as such it will kill some bacteria, but it will not sterilize surfaces to medical or scientific standards, which require extended exposure to steam at or above 273F at much higher than normal pressure.  As far as I can find, only the best commercial steamers will generate steam at or above 270 degrees Fahrenheit at high enough pressure - probably due to the cost.  So although the Dirt Devil will clean surfaces and kill some bacteria, don't expect that it will sterilize surfaces to any scientific or medical standard - I doubt that any small consumer level steam cleaner will.That said, I like this Dirt Devil 2-in-1 Versa much better than my Bissell Lift-Off Steam Mop, it's quieter, much lighter, easier to use and it's half the price.  So if you're looking for a steam mop or a steam cleaner, I would say this Dirt Devil does a good job for a reasonable price.  I'm writing this review after using it for only one day (I was so happy with it), so I'll see if the good feeling lasts or if it develops issues.  I'll update this review in the future after using it more, but so far so good.One last thing... Keep your kids and hands away from the steam at all times.  At 200+F, the steam is extremely scalding hot!  Do not allow small children to get access to this unit.  It is no joke.  If you can do that, I think you'll be very happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BM4L2HRJS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4MHJLO#wasThisHelpful","R31BM4L2HRJS2","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start out by providing some specs for the IonBank 10k since they are not all included in the description...Dimensions: 4.84"" x 3.15"" x 0.98"" (12.3 x 8 x 2.5cm)Weight: 11.28 oz (320 g)Battery capacity: 10,000mAh, 37WhInput level: 5V at 0.5~2.1AOutput level: 5V at 0.5~3.6ACombined simultaneous output: 18W.The aluminum sided case is very attractive.  It has two Type A female USB ports into which you can plug the devices you want to charge.  It can charge two devices at once - any combination of phones or tablets.  Next to the USB ports there is a five-segment, white LED capacity meter and a small button which you press to show the current relative charge level of IonBank 10k.  As the IonBank 10k charges, those lights blink to indicate that the IonBank is charging and they indicate its current relative recharge level.  The finish and build quality of the pack are excellent.  One side of the case slides open smoothly to reveal a three-inch, hardwired USB cable with a Type A USB connector - this is used to charge the IonBank 10k.That's all great.But the IonBank 10k is not ideally suited for users of modern Android devices.  Why?  For the following reasons:1. In order to charge up the IonBank 10k, you must plug it into a USB port or charger that you already own, like one you use to charge your Android phone or tablet.  This wouldn't be a big deal since Android users probably have at least one and maybe more than one USB chargers around - except that you must plug it in via the built-in, hardwired, three-inch-long cable ending in full size type A USB connector.  This is not good because if your USB phone/tablet charger is plugged into a wall outlet, you'll have to hang the IonBank 10k off the charger and the wall since the three-inch cable is not long enough to reach the floor - and the IonBank 10k is relatively heavy (the specs list it as 11.28oz).  Or, for instance, if your charger is on the floor, you'll have to charge the IonBank 10k right down on the floor with it.  You could buy a USB type A male to type A female extension cable, but for a $100+ device, I shouldn't have to do that.  Ideally, it should have had a micro-USB female port that you could just plug the cable that you already use to charge your Android phone or tablet directly into it in order to charge the IonBank 10k.  For me, the lack of that micro-USB female port is a fail for this $100+ battery pack - especially for users of Android devices that probably already have a charger set up with a micro-USB cable plugged into it to charge your Android phone or tablet.2. You must have a USB cable with you in order to charge your Android device.  Unlike it's IonBank 5k sibling, the IonBank 10k does not have a built-in micro USB cable to charge your device.  Instead, you must provide and plug a separate cable into one of it's Type A female USB ports.  This is not ideal especially considering the IonBank 10k already has the hidden compartment with the poorly considered 3"" charge cable that shouldn't be there.  It should instead have been a similar short cable with a micro-usb male connector capable of charging your Android device.  Another fail for Android device users and the users of most modern devices (other than Apple's) that charge through a micro-USB port.3. You cannot charge a phone or tablet when charging the IonBank 10k.  The charging ports are disabled when the IonBank is being charged, so it cannot charge or act as a passthrough.  I was surprised since I have other battery packs that allow you to charge a device while charging the battery pack.  Unfortunately, that is not the case with this battery pack.  Even when IonBank 10k is fully charged, it still cannot act as a passthough to charge your device.  So you must unplug the IonBank 10k from your charger and plug your phone/tablet device into it or your charger.  That sucks.I've been testing this battery pack for about three weeks now.  It takes about five hours to fully charge the IonBank 10k from complete exhaustion using a 5.3V 2A output USB charger.  If you have a 5.0V 1A charger, you're probably going to be waiting ten hours.  The pack gets warm, but that's expected.  For my most excellent 2014 Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, I get about an extra five hours of serious 3D gaming when using this pack.  If I were only web browsing or doing some other light to moderate tasks, I might get an extra seven hours.  A fully, recently charged IonBank 10k can fully charge an exhausted 2014 Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 once with a bit of power leftover.  However, I noticed that when the IonBank 10k is down to about 40% capacity according to its own meter, the voltage drops off considerably and it can no longer keep my 2014 Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 fully charged when the IonBank is still supposedly charging it.  It drops off quickly from there.  I suspect that the LED capacity meter on the IonBank 10k isn't very accurate and the 40% mark is more like 10%, at least on mine.  Additionally, if you fully charge the IonBank 10k, store it and then use it a week later, don't expect to get the full 10,000mAh capacity.  The battery slowly discharges over time and even though the meter may read full, you're probably missing 10~20% of the capacity already.  So don't count on this to save your butt if you haven't charged it in awhile.  Finally, it comes with a very unusual if not pathetic case/pouch that I find less than useful - especially for a $100+ battery pack.All things considered, it is an okay to good battery pack.  But due the inconvenience of the design when charging and using the pack as an Android device user, I would say check out other battery packs before you purchase this one.  I'm not saying don't buy it, I'm saying there may be other battery packs available of similar capacity that address the issues I cited above.  For me, this is a classic case of form over function.  It's a pretty pack.  It's physically well made.  But the fact that it forces you to use the short 3"" cable to charge the IonBank 10k, and with no built in cable to charge a device with, for me it's not ideally suited for users of modern Android devices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBS8VZZSLMRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9Y47Y6#wasThisHelpful","R2CBS8VZZSLMRY","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About eight years ago, I purchased a Dyson DC17 Animal.  It is a seriously great vacuum cleaner.  It works great but it has three downsides - One, it's expensive.  Two, it's relatively heavy and three, emptying the bagless canister is an exercise in controlling filth.  I HATE emptying the canister.  But in order to have a second vacuum, I thought I would give the bagless Eureka AS3008 Airspeed a try which comes in at a fraction of the price of my Dyson.  I've had it about two months now.The first thing is that you'll need to assemble the Eureka as it comes disassembled in major parts which snap together easily in minutes if you follow the included instructions.  Once you assemble it, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is.  But don't let it's light weight fool you - this is a powerful vacuum cleaner.  Even though it's not self propelled, the low weight makes it easy to clean carpets with a lot less effort than any other vacuum I've used.On my very first and many subsequent uses, I would say that the Eureka Airspeed did as good of a job if not better than my Dyson DC17 on medium and low pile carpets.  It was very impressive, especially considering the weight difference.  The Eureka Airspeed is so much lighter than my Dyson DC17, it made vacuuming almost fun.  Almost.  I also find that it expells a lot less hot air than my Dyson.  That may not sound like a big deal, but trust me, when vacumming in the heat of the summer, its nice.  And the excellent two filter filtration ensures that exhaust air is clean.  One of the filters is washable - just hose and wring a few times then let air dry.  The other filter is for finer particles and its replaceable, but it doesn't have to be replaced very often (and as of now, I can't even find a Eureka EF-7 filter on Amazon).  I still hate emptying the bagless canister, but its easy to do with no surprises.  The canister snaps off with a lever, and snaps back on when emptied.  In fact, I find emptying and cleaning the caninster on this Eureka is easier to do and the results are better than emptying and cleaning the canister on the Dyson DC17.  Additionally, on the Eureka, you can hose down the entire canister assembly including the root cyclone part, so you can get it completely clean.  On the Dyson DC17, you can only hose down the canister, but Dyson warns against getting the root cyclone part wet, so it stays filthy.  Either way, I empty mine outside on the back patio.  Yuck!  I can't see getting a bagless vacuum if you live in an apartment... I would not be thrilled if I had to deal with this indoors.There are some features on my Dyson that I miss on the Eureka though.  For one thing, my Dyson automatically adjusts to different heights of carpet.  This Eureka Airspeed does not.  The Eureka has a five setting height dial on the head to adjust for bare floor to high pile carpets.  That's no big deal, but is it noted.Two, and this one is the biggest difference, my Dyson DC17 allows you to just grab the accessory hose at any time and use it.  When you put the Dyson DC17 in full upright, the beater bar is disabled and suction is automatically diverted to the hose.  When you put the hose back and put the Dyson at an angle to use on carpet, the beater bar activates and suction is returned to the carpet head.  When you want to use the hose with this Eureka Airspeed, you must turn a knob on the frame of the vacuum to divert the suction from the carpet head to the hose - And most importantly, you must remember to turn that knob back to divert the suction back to the carpet head when you're done with the hose.  As a person who is used to the Dyson, there were a few times I was pushing the Eureka around a bit with the suction diverted to the hose until I realized it.  Additionally, on this particular model AS3008A, the beater bar does not stop when the unit is at full upright or using the hose and there is no manual switch to disable it.  The accessory hose and tools do work well, but here is where the light weight of the Eureka Airspeed is a negative - The Eureka Airspeed is so light that you have to secure its body when using the hose or the Eureka will simply topple over.  You literally cannot use the hose on anything without worrying about what the vacuum body is doing.  I find that I have to keep a hand or foot on it at all times in order to keep it from falling over when using the hose - not an ideal situation.  Luckily, the times it did fall over, the canister stayed securely in place!  Whew!I cannot predict its reliability or durability over time but so far, so good.  Overall, I would say as an upright vacuum cleaner, this Eureka Airspeed does a great job - as good or better than my Dyson DC17 - and I say that as a satisfied Dyson owner.  Additionally, the light weight of this vacuum makes it easy to maneuver while using it and easy to carry around, go up and down stairs with it, etc.  But using the accessory hose and tools, even though they work well, is a hassle due to the lightweight body falling over at the slightest pull.  If you can live with that, then this is a great vacuum for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMJCO3RCT41J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQJLCX4#wasThisHelpful","R1KMJCO3RCT41J","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first opened the box containing these knives I did so with great caution as you could just tell they were very sharp.  I hand cleaned and thoroughly dried all of them and kept the Santoku knife in the plastic sheath it comes in.  All of these knives are Swiss made from cold rolled high-carbon steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened.  They all have Fibrox handles.  For those of you who don't know, (and I didn't), Fibrox mineral fiber is an inorganic, biosoluble, glassy material spun at high temperatures derived from molten minerals.  Although it resembles plastic, it is not plastic.  I've used these knives at least a dozen times over the past two weeks.The star attraction of the set I ordered is the Santoku knife.  The knife including the handle is just under a foot in length.  The blade is 6 and 3/4 inches long.  The blade has the telltale Santoku indents attractively machined along it's length which assist in releasing sliced items from the blade.  The five-inch Fibrox handle is solid, tough and hard.  It has a nice texture with rounded edges and is formed to be very comfortable to hold.  I find the handle to be very solidly attached to the blade with exactly zero play in any direction and the handle does not bend.  This Santoku knife as a whole is much lighter than I expected which makes it easier to handle with less fatigue.  It is very well balanced with the center of weight located just where the blade meets the handle.  I've used the Santoku knife for slicing cucumber, tomato, celery and onion for salads.  It goes though everything well and accurately including ripe tomatoes which a dull knife can easily ruin.  As this knife is very lightweight and the blade is thinner than other knives I own, I cannot predict durability, but it is my understanding that these knives take to sharpening very well and should last for years.The peeler has serrated edges and a nicely formed, comfortable Fibrox handle.  It is very light weight and the edges are very sharp.  I've used the peeler to shred carrots for salads.  I find I like the serrated edges and the tiny ridges it imparts to the carrot shreds gives them more surface area and makes them more flavorful.I find the utility knife to be very useful.  Of course, it too has a Fibrox handle.  The blade is serrated from one side (as opposed to both sides) and it is very sharp.  This knife is great for slicing bread at the dinner table - It goes though bread very well with no fuss and beats having a full-sized bread knife at the dinner table.  It could also be used as a steak knife or for anything where a serrated knife is perferred.Overall I like these knives but as I've only used them for two weeks, so I cannot say how well they will hold up over time.  So far so good though.UPDATE: 10/6/2014It's been another month and I've been using these knives at every opportunity.  The Santoku knife cuts london broil like a boss - you can make delicious, super thin cuts of london broil with ease.  I've even used the Santoku knife to cut birthday cake, and cuts it cleanly without any effort or crushing.  The serrated utility knife may seem like a throw in, but I find myself using it constantly.  Along with using it to cut loaves of French and Italian bread at the dinner table, I've used it to cut apple pie as perfect as can be without smushing it or destroying the crust.  I've also used it to cut homemade sicilian pizza with a crispy crust and it did so without crushing the crust and made perfect, clean cuts.  I have to tell you, both of these knives are super sharp and you have to be careful when handling them and especially when cleaning them.  They will cut you if you don't respect them.  I'm very happy with these knives so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXT9TCMPZGRIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFLTTC#wasThisHelpful","RXT9TCMPZGRIT","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This stand assist is easy to assemble and use.  I had it set up on a recliner my mom used all the time.  I found that I was able to recline even with the assist installed - basically, the frame would recline with the chair.  I don't think that won't work with every recliner, but it did work with ours.  The only caveat so far is that depending on what you're using it on, the end of the legs may stick out a few inches creating a hazard when walking near it.  On the recliner we used it on, the legs of the stand assist stick out the sides by only a few inches, but it was enough for my dad to trip on it.  Luckily, he didn't fall, but that worried me.  If you're using it on a couch, the legs probably won't be a problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAH2G34XN03P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I45JJRS#wasThisHelpful","R1LAH2G34XN03P","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already had a pretty good phone mount - an older Arkon model SM410, but it is a two piece design where the cradle that holds the phone slid into a groove on the ball joint.  The problem was that the cradle didn't *lock* into the groove on the ball joint and recently the cradle, with phone attached, slipped out while driving.  My phone fell onto my dashboard and luckily I caught it in time, but I had to pull over to remount it.  That incident encouraged me to investigate a new mount.I saw this new Arkon model MG279 mount and it looked sleek but sturdy with a nice strong vise action to hold the phone in the mount.  When I received it, I have to admit that at first I didn't like the way the vise action worked as the vise is always under tension to grip the phone with no way to release it.  But I quickly learned how to easily install and remove the phone with no fuss.  Now I love this mount!  The vise action is strong, smooth and precise.  The two fingers that hold the phone are hard rubber so once your phone is properly in place against the flat mounting surface behind the phone, there is no play even when using the touchscreen.  (At the moment, I have a 4.7"" LG Optimus G in a Body Glove case, btw)The suction cup on this mount has a sticky surface and it really helps it to grip my windshield.  Not that I ever had a problem with the ""regular"" suction cups of previous mounts, but this one is even more secure.  Regular suction cups work best with a little spit on them first, whereas this sticky cup works bone dry.  Spit would have the opposite effect on this mount as it would diminish the sticky property of the suction cup surface.  It takes a little more effort to remove the sticky mount from the windshield, but its worth it.  If you get this mount, I suggest you keep the thin plastic protective sheet that ships on the suction cup and cover it back up when you're not using it in order to keep it clean.  I never leave the mount on the windshield as it just makes your car a target for crime - whether or not the phone is in the car.. a thief wouldn't know that.The rest of the hardware also works well.  The joint which holds the arm to the suction cup has tiny teeth that keep the arm firmly where you set it once you tighten the screw.  The ball joint works smoothly and it allows you to tilt your phone easily but firmly if you have the ring tightened properly.  There is one issue though -  For some reason, Arkon put what I can only describe as a ""tab"" right behind the ball joint and that tab limits your ability to tilt the phone.  I see no reason for that tab to be there and I may remove it from my mount.  That tab aside, this is a great quality mount that will hold your phone securely to the windshield that is easy to set up and use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KIGTYCOXK3RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I58VAZS#wasThisHelpful","R2KIGTYCOXK3RR","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this pan in the hope that I could use it to reheat and cook some items better in the microwave as opposed to normal microwave heating or turning on the conventional oven.  Summer is coming and I hate to turn on the oven in hot summer weather.  So I was really hoping this pan would function as more of a conventional oven in the microwave, but it doesn't.  What it does is function exactly like an overheated frying pan in the microwave.  The cooking surface gets really hot really fast and you can't control the temperature.  You also can't see the food while its cooking since its under the cover and in the microwave.  Because the cooking surface gets so hot and you can't see the food, food burns easily - far too easily - and it will burn the bottom of the food in contact with it much faster than it reheats or cooks that food.  A difference of 30 seconds or a minute could be the difference between very burnt but uncooked food and still uncooked-but-not-yet-burnt food.  Without any control over the temperature, the pan has limited usefulness for me.  And there are other issues.  Let me explain.Last night I decided to try to make a hamburger in the pan.  You can't get simpler than that, right?  I put a very tiny amount of coconut oil in the center of the pan - less than half a teaspoon.  I put the raw hamburger in, put the cover on and popped it into my 1100-watt microwave.  I put three minutes on the clock.  Went to turn the burger over and the pan is filled with smoke already - and now so is my kitchen.  Additionally, the grease from the burger was splattering all over the place when I had the cover opened to turn the burger - exactly as if I was frying the burger in pan.  Furthermore, I can see that some grease is getting in behind the seal that surrounds the pan's cooking surface.  This is a big problem, since you can't immerse the pan in water, you can't put it in the dishwasher and you can't remove the seal, so its literally impossible to remove what grease gets in there.  By the end of cooking the burger, the kitchen had its share of smoke and stinks of burnt fat.  There is grease all over my stove just from the time of checking/turning the burger.  And while the burger cooked okay, it would have come out much better under the broiler in my oven, or in a conventional frying pan for that matter.  So I won't be making burgers in this pan again.After that experience, and some others, I just don't see anything this pan can do well for me.  I may experiment with it a little more, but knowing that it functions exactly like an uncontrollable, super hot frying pan, I just don't see much use for it.  If I need to fry something, I'll fry it in a conventional pan where I can control the heat and see the food as it cooks.  That food will come out much better than it will in in this pan.  Just because this pan has slightly raised ridges, doesn't make it it a grill.  It's a frying pan for the microwave.  Who needs that?","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ9QCSQYDWMPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FGAVEK#wasThisHelpful","RJ9QCSQYDWMPT","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have Verizon FiOS for TV and internet at home and for all you Verizon FiOS users, you know that the Actiontec wireless router provided is not exactly the best for strong wireless signals.  I have an older model MI424WR-GEN2, so the best it can do is wireless-G.  It does not have AC or even N.  For years I had to deal with weak wireless signal throughout my house, especially in the bedroom which is located furthest from the router, two floors up and across the house from the router which is located in the basement.  Additionally, where I live, there are a TON of other wireless installations in the area, all of which are competing with my wireless for signal strength.  I could only get one bar of strength in the bedroom, even with the antenna on the router aimed correctly and with the best channel selected.Enter this TP-LINK TL-WPA4220KIT Advanced powerline/wireless kit.  This kit works by adding a second wireless access point to your house which you can place in an ideal location.  It doesn't have to be anywhere near your router because it links back to your router via an ethernet-though-powerline connection.  It sends its signal though your house wiring, so you don't have run ethernet cables throughout your home.Setup can be a little tricky and if you're not a computer person, you may need to borrow or rent somebody who is.  I have a Windows PC, so I cannot speak for Mac users.  This is the installation in a nutshell for a Verizon FiOS user, since the Actiontec router does not have a working Wi-Fi Clone function.  First, install the included software onto your computer.  The ""Powerline Utility"" is used to locate and configure the the base unit.  The ""Powerline Scan"" is used to locate and configure the wireless access point.  It would be nice if there was one program which did both functions, but its no big deal.Then, plug the smaller, wired connection into an open LAN port of your router with an ethernet cable (this kit includes two if you don't have any).  Now plug that unit directly into a wall outlet - Note that you shouldn't plug it into any kind of surge protector, UPS or power conditioner.  If you do, you may not get the maximum speeds this system is capable of or it may not work at all.  Now if you run the ""Powerline Utility,"" you should be able to see the base unit show up in the list.  Now plug the larger, Wireless Access Point (AP) unit into another wall outlet.  For the purpose of configuration, just plug it in near your computer and the base unit.  Don't worry, you can relocate it later.  Now press the ""pair"" button on the Wireless AP unit, and then press the ""pair"" button on the base unit (it doesn't matter what order).  If everything went well, the powerline lights are now lit or blinking on both units and the two units should now be communicating with each other over your house wiring.  Also, the larger Wireless AP unit should now show up if you run the ""Powerline Scan"" software.  Now you have the hardware installed, but not configured.Now open a web browser, and go to 192.168.1.1.  This is the default IP address for the larger Wireless AP unit.  Note that this default default IP address for the TP-LINK *may* interfere with your router or another device on your home network, so it wasn't the best choice IMO.  You log into it using the default username/password provided.  And from this web interface, you can configure your new Wireless AP exactly as if you were configuring your home router - for instance, you can control the SSID, wireless security, network type etc. of the new Wireless AP.  From here you can set up the remote unit to be a duplicate of your main wireless AP, or set it up with a different SSID, preshared key, etc.  Once you have everything set up the way you like, you can simply unplug the larger, Wireless AP unit and locate it where you need it to be in your house.  It will automatically reconnect with the base unit - you don't have to re-pair it with the base unit or do anything else, just plug it back in.I have my new TP-LINK access point set up in a room on the 2nd floor of my house as a duplicate of my original wireless setup, except I have it set to wireless-N only and I have it set to a different channel for maximum performance.  Now when I connect to wireless in my bedroom on my LG Optimus G or 2014 Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, I can get the full speed of my FiOS setup, which is 50 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up, where I could barely get 5 or 10 Mbps down before.  Additionally, the remote wireless AP unit has two ethernet ports which you can plug computers or other devices like game consoles or DVRs into directly or install a network switch or hub without having to run ethernet cables through your home.  On average, I'm seeing amost 200 Mbps when plugged in directly which is much faster than my internet connnection is capable of.For me, there are only two minor downsides.  For one thing, I'm losing two electrical outlets.  The units have no passthrough.  That's no big deal, but it is worth mentioning.  And second, because of the nature of my installation, where my Verizon Actiontec router only has wireless-G and I have the new TP-LINK access point set to wireless-N, and I have them manually set to different channels for superior signal strength, my wireless devices do not switch between them automatically when I'm closer to one access point or the other.  Again, this is no big deal for me as it takes only seconds to cycle the wireless off and back on my devices after which they then pick up the strongest (closest) access point.  I think if I had them set identically to wireless G and to the same channel, my devices may switch between them automatically, but I haven't tried that - and I'm not going to use the new TP-LINK access point on slower G when it has N.  Since in my case, they do act independently, I may set up the TP-LINK with a separate SSID, etc., so I know exactly which one I'm connected to.Overall, I'm very happy with the kit and it solves a problem I've been having for years.

"Until recently, I had been using an previous model Norelco QT4022 which I got in 2011.  It worked well, but the battery was starting to show its age - meaning that the battery charges weren't lasting very long.  In addition, it developed this extremely unusual problem where it would not work corded in my bathroom, but would work corded everywhere else I tried!  That drove me nuts!  That model also had the issue of the mystery battery charge as there was no indication of the status of the battery when using or charging the unit.This new Norelco BT5275 is improved over that previous model in many ways.  Most importantly, the motor speed is faster, so it cuts faster and it cuts closer to the skin if you so desire.  It seems to vibrate less and it feels more precise than the QT4022.  Beard and sideburn trimming are fast and precise.  They don't show it in any of the photos here, but there is a hard plastic length guide that snaps into the top of the unit.  You snap that guide in, and then you turn the nicely rubberized grey wheel in the center of the unit to select a length.  The wheel is notched and it has numerical markings on it to indicate the desired trim length.  As you turn the wheel, you can also see the guide get higher or lower over the cutting blade.  This guide allows you to trim your beard or sideburns to any length you desire, quickly and easily without having to worry about making mistakes.  Take the length guide off the unit and you can make precise edges on your beard or sideburns - or you can trim your beard down to fine stubble to make it easier to shave.  The top of this unit actually rotates between the main trimmer and an even more precise mini-trimmer.  I don't have a use for the mini-trimmer, but I can see that some people may find it very useful depending on the style of beard they have.  Since this is a wet/dry trimmer, you can use it bone dry or in the shower or just with a wet face, which I prefer.  Simply rinse the trimmer off and let it dry.  Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  My previous Norelco QT4022 had none of this.  Battery life has been stellar so far, much better than I remember it was on my previous Norelco QT4022 even when it was new.  I've used it many times on a single charge!  The manual states 60 minutes of use from a 60 minute charge.  So far, that seems accurate.  Maybe that's because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit used a nickel-metal hydride battery.  Finally, this unit requires no maintenance and no oiling, so thats one less thing you'll have to be concerned with.There is one thing I don't like about it, and that is the placement and type of on/off switch.  The switch itself is a push-button electronic switch.  It feels mushy and imprecise.  I also feel that the switch is located too low on the handle of the unit.  You have to make an effort to turn it on and off, instead of the switch being located where your fingers fall naturally higher on the handle.  A slide type switch, located higher on the unit would have been ideal.Overall, I am very happy with this trimmer.  It works great, it handles well and keeps my beard the way I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TCD1PHUGIC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB2ARDU#wasThisHelpful","R39TCD1PHUGIC4","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:20 MinsThis is an all-around excellent Android tablet.  Let me start off with a brief review of the tablet's physical attributes.The first thing you'll want to know about is the display.  It is very, very good.  It is very high resolution by today's standards at 2560x1600 boasting 299 pixels-per-inch (think about how laser printers were once the same at 300 dots-per-inch).  It is also very bright with great color reproduction and good contrast.  The screen uses IPS technology and it has excellent viewing angles - so you don't have to worry about being perfectly aligned with the screen in order to see it clearly and the contrast stays good even at steep angles.  The screen has an aspect ratio of 16:10, so the Note is ideal for internet browsing, gaming or viewing HD video.  The Note also has very good stereo speakers located along the upper right and left edge (when the tablet held in its native landscape mode) - they produce loud and clear audio and the speaker placement doesn't interfere with your hand placement.  Of course there isn't any bass to speak of, but one cannot expect any bass from speakers of this size.  Still, the audio sounds good when playing games or watching internet videos.  As I previously mentioned, the Note is meant to be held in landscape mode, with the hardware home button closest to you.  Of course, the screen content can rotate to portrait, depending on the program.  Most of what I use it for works in landscape, which is good because I prefer it that way.  Unfortunately, the USB 2.0/power port is located in the center of the bottom edge right under the hardware home button.  This can present an issue if you want to charge the battery when using the tablet at an angle on a stand in landscape mode as a USB plug can interfere with the bottom edge.  I think it would have made much more sense to have the USB 2.0/power port located on either the top or right edge of the tablet.  Located just to the left of the USB/power port on the bottom edge is a microphone.  There is a Micro SDXC slot under a cover along the right edge which can currently accept up to a 64GB Micro SDXC card.  This is useful for storing large amounts of media such as music, photos and video files, which can be quite large.  I highly recommend the Samsung 64GB Pro microSDXC card as it currently the fastest and most reliable 64GB Micro SDXC card available.  Moving on, there is an 8MP rear facing camera with LED flash and a 2MP front facing camera.  I haven't used the cameras very much at all, so I can't really comment on them.  There is an infrared port along the top edge which facilitates the use of the tablet as a smart universal remote control with an integrated program guide (for which the software is included).  I know it works because I tried it with my TiVo HD, but I didn't find it very useful for me so I haven't used it since.  Depending on your home A/V setup, it may be very useful for you.  The power and volume control buttons are located along the top edge on the far left.  I feel that those buttons are too difficult to navigate as they are small with very little feel or button travel.  As a result, I installed a software volume control which resides in the Android notification shade that I like a lot better.  The earphone jack is located on the top left edge.  On the top right edge is the slot for storing the S-Pen (along with the actual S-Pen).  The S-Pen, which is one of the main features of this tablet, allows you to draw and write directly on the screen.  I have used it at times for text input and the tablet will recognize your handwriting (either in block or script!) and translate it into editable text, which is really cool.  The tablet feels really good in the hand.  For me, it's not heavy at all and I can easily hold it with one hand.  The back of the tablet has a grippy, faux leather like finish, which I like, but my tablet lives in an excellent Poetic Slimline case, so I don't get to feel that very often.Although the 2014 Note 10.1 can be used for a wide range of things, what I got this tablet for is gaming!  And boy does this tablet deliver.  With it's 3GB of RAM, the latest generation Samsung Exynos 5420 octa-core processor (which is really a dual quad-core) and a Mali-T628 graphics processor, I get excellent gaming performance!  I regularly play Asphalt 8, which looks amazing on this tablet with it's real time reflections, motion blur, advanced lighting and particle effects.  It looks and plays great!  Since I'm a sucker for good racing games, and racing games are a natural fit on tablets since you can usually steer by rotating/tilting the tablet, I also play GT Racing 2, which again, looks amazing playing in the full 2560x1600 resolution of the tablet.  I also play Armored Aces, which is a great, WWII 3D multiplayer tank game, Heroes of Destiny, which is a great 3D dungeon battle game, and Dead Trigger 2, which is an super fun 3D first-person-shooter which pits you against hordes and hordes of very unreasonable zombies in locations around the world.  These are among the latest and greatest 3D games available and they look and play incredibly well on the 2014 Galaxy Note 10.1.  Not surprisingly, 2D games like Clash of Clans also look amazing and play extremely well on the Note.  It also plays video very well both from the internet and local files you store on the SD card.  This device is a great companion for a trip or flight.  Battery life is stellar for me.  I get over six hours of screen time when 3D gaming the whole time (yes, I really need to get a life).  If I were to use it like a normal person, I could easily see getting over eight hours of screen time on a charge.  One minor issue is that I don't feel that the charger is strong enough as it really doesn't charge the battery very much at all when charging while the tablet is in use.  It will charge a few percent, but it doesn't really charge well at all as long as the screen is on.There is one fairly important issue though which I would like to touch on and that is the some buggy behavior with the touchscreen itself.  At the moment, there is an issue where if you touch and hold any area of the screen for 24 seconds, your touch will be reset and it will not work well again for about five seconds.  Why is this a problem, you ask?  Well, say you're playing a racing game that requires you to push an on-screen gas pedal.  After 24 seconds, you won't be pressing it anymore, even if you are in fact, still pressing it.  If you try to immediately press it again, it will immediately disengage again for about five seconds until it acts normal again for the next 24 seconds, and so on.  That is but one example of the issue, but it could happen with controls for direction in a first-person-shooter or some other type of game.  But really no matter what you're doing, or what software you're running, whether it is a game, productivity software, music, or whatever, if you touch the screen in one area for 24 seconds straight, it will reset your touch and not work well again for about five seconds.  It's a problem.  Through the XDA Developers forum, I verified that this problem likely exists on all of the 2014 Note 10.1 devices (model SM-P600) with firmware MK1.  I believe it is a driver issue.  From what I understand, so far Samsung has not acknowledged the problem.  Hopefully, they will discover and fix this with the next firmware release as it can be a really a major issue depending on what you're doing.  Luckily most of the racing games I play have the option for automatic throttle, but I wish I could use a manual throttle control.  It does affect my Armored Aces gameplay as I have to remember to quickly get off and then back on the throttle prior to 24 seconds in order to avoid a bad situation.  *(4/27/2014: The 24-second-timeout issue with the touchscreen was fixed with new ND2 firmware!)*Overall, it's a great, versatile tablet.  I love it.  In fact, I own two of them and I gave a third to my girlfriend who also loves it.  If it wasn't for the issues with the weak charger and especially the touchscreen, I would give it five stars.***04/27/2014 UPDATE:***Lets say four and a half stars!  In the past week, Samsung released its Android KitKit 4.4.2 firmware update for the US version of the 2014 Note 10.1 (firmware ND2).  I applied it a few days ago and I can tell you along with the update from Jellybean to KitKat, it also fixes the 24-second-timeout issue with the touchscreen.  The KitKat update has made the overall tablet experience faster and smoother.  Samsung made some nice changes to Touchwiz including a better notification shade and a better task manager to name a few.  Unfortunately, the KitKat update also introduces the Google-mandated restriction on which apps can write to the external SD card.  Even though I'm not a fan of this restriction, it doesn't really affect me (yet) and I don't think it will affect most users.  The restriction can be eliminated if you root the tablet.  Overall, I'm very happy with the update so far, and I will report back if I find any issues!***05/17/2014 UPDATE:***One thing I've seen some people complain about is that the speaker grilles either are or get loose and then have a bit of play in them.  Mine were a bit loose from the start, but it wasn't an issue until today.  Today I noticed that the right speaker grille is very loose.  It's not falling out and it doesn't come out, but the top edge of the right grille is literally hanging out.  Just to make sure it couldn't fall out, I tried pulling it off using some masking tape, but it held in place.  The left grille has some play in it but its not nearly as loose as the right grille (yet?).  Since it doesn't snap back into place and the grille is so small and fine, I haven't figured out a way to fix this.  I'm not sure I want to use glue as glue could damage the finish and it may make it difficult to disassemble the tablet, if that is ever necessary.  I'll update if I fix this or if it gets worse.  While this is something to look out for, this is an excellent tablet, and this is not something that should keep you from considering one.***06/26/2014 UPDATE:***I have found Real Racing 3!  (see video)  Wow!  Hands down it is the best racing game on the Android platform at this time!  It has the best physics, the most detailed cars (including interiors) and it is both fun and challenging to play!  There are currently 91 different cars and 12 tracks (many with multiple configurations).  It looks great and plays really well on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1!  Alphalt 8 and GT Racing 2 are out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2L2YEXCJDNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3SOJ88#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2L2YEXCJDNP","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could have been an all around great relatively compact camera.  It has a full size image sensor for low noise and high light sensitivity - it enables the camera to take images with a high degree of detail and the camera great in low light situations.  It accepts interchangeable E-mount lenses.  It has an amazing flip-up and tilt LCD touch screen with a high-pixel density so images are super clear and you can easily frame and even manually focus shots well if you choose to do so without a viewfinder.  It has almost all the latest bells and whistles such as Wi-Fi, NFC, face recognition, a fast autofocus, touch-to-focus, and full-HD video recording at 60-frames-per-second, etc.  The one thing it does not have is a built in flash.  Surprise!  That's right folks, Sony sacrificed functionality for form factor and this camera does not have a built-in pop-up flash.  It comes with a separate flash unit that you have to plug in and screw onto the top of the unit, which is a pain in the #$$ and I think it kills the overall flexibility of the camera.  If you're buying this camera instead of a larger DLSR, are you going to want to carry a flash around with you, either in your pocket, or mounted on top of the unit where it can be easily damaged?  Sony has other cameras in the NEX line with a built in, pop-up flash such as the NEX-3NL/B.  Why couldn't they have made this camera body slightly larger to accomodate a built in a flash?  What was Sony thinking?  It seems like such an afterthought.  You either have to have the flash unit with you and/or attached at all times or do without the flash.  Either way it limits your flexibility.  A lot of photos are taken indoors, with friends or at functions, etc. and you need a flash.  I want to be able to grab this camera and go.  I don't want to have to think about whether the flash is attached or not.  It's not even like its a hotshoe flash (which this camera does not support, no hotshoe on this model).  Its a dinky little flash.  For me, this takes what could have been a great compact camera and relagates it to only good.  And what a shame considering all of the other technology they put into this thing.  It takes great pictures, clear video, it has good battery life, and it has all kinds of other bells and whistles but I think Sony made a mistake leaving out a built-in flash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XG6VNB78N9SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENZRP38#wasThisHelpful","R2XG6VNB78N9SC","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I that find this lantern comes in handy more often than you may think.  Need to get wires straightened under a desk?  Bring the lantern with you to light up the area.  And that's what it does very well, light up an area.  Unlike a flashlight which generally provides a beam, this lantern lights up an pretty good size area, nicely and evenly.  You can carry it using it's very ergonomic carry handle which is nicely textured and feels good in the hand.  You can just put it down somewhere with its very stable, nicely weighted base thanks to the four ""D"" batteries inside and use it upright.  You can even remove the clear polycarbonate dome, which twists off easily, and use the hook recessed on the very bottom of the base to hang it upside down for use as an overhead light.  It has two brightness settings.  On high, the 260 lumen output is fairly bright and is good for outdoor use or lighting up that project you're working on.  On low, it provides more than enough light to deal with a dark room easily, like if there was a power outage.  It even has a USB outlet which you can use to charge a phone or tablet off of the four ""D"" batteries.  There is a small, red LED light which blinks when the four ""D"" batteries are running low - note that when the batteries are low, the light only blinks when the light is on - so the battery monitor apparently does not sap power from the batteries when the light is not in use.  The power switch is rubber coated and so are the sides and bottom of the unit, so its very grippy and feels good in the hand.  The USB outlet also has a rubber cover to keep out dust, dirt and water.  The unit seems very well made and solid, although I'm sure if you drop it onto concrete bad things will happen.  The only somewhat negative thing I can say is that I often find myself trying to turn the unit on by pressing the rubber cover on the USB port... because the USB port is mounted directly over the power switch, which my brain thinks is backwards. :-)  But overall, I think its a great little light!  Pick one up with some ""D"" batteries just to have for when the power goes out.  But like me, I think you will find it more useful than that.  Trust me, you will not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5H6N8HT1N7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ6L7DO#wasThisHelpful","RD5H6N8HT1N7R","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is good toilet paper.  It's soft and absorbent.  It works well for what it's intended for.  It's convenient to have it delivered to your door.But let me tell you the problem with it and with every other brand of toilet paper lately.  Charmin and all the rest of the manufacturers must think we're all stupid.  They keep making the cardboard hubs larger while putting less and less paper on ever increasingly narrower rolls while still calling them ""double rolls.""  The ""double rolls"" of today are nothing more than what used to be ""regular"" rolls of ten of fifteen years ago.  The cardboard hubs get larger, the paper gets smaller.  I get it that we are in a bad economy and I get it that the price of the materials has increased due to inflation and other factors, but when does this stop?

"The GoPro HERO3+ Black Edition has very definite and noticable improvements over the HERO3 Black Edition.  Pretty much everything is better about it!  Starting with the new lens which helps the HERO3+ Black Edition produce much sharper video than before, with better, more lifelike color, better saturation, better contrast and truer white balance (say goodbye to the yellow cast!).  It also has better low light performance with better clarity and color accuracy than before at night and in light challenged situations.  The new microphones and audio system produce video with waaaay clearer, much more accurate and dynamic audio.  The HERO3+ Black Edition has about a 20~25% improved battery life/charge thanks to both a higher capacity battery and better power consumption.  The WIFI speed and range have been dramatically improved thanks to a new WIFI chip.  In my experience, I get a range increase of close to five times that of Hero3 Black Edition.  Even the waterproof case has been improved as it is about 20% smaller, with a much-easier-to-use latch system and much-easier-to-use buttons.  Additionally, the HERO3+ Black Edition has a new super wide angle mode called SuperView which gives you the widest viewing angles yet.  GoPro has really been listening to the user community and these improvements make an already great live-action camera even better!If you do pick one up, be certain to purchase a GOOD, FAST MicroSD card.  I highly recommend the Samsung 64GB Pro microSDXC(MB-MGCGB/AM) card.  I have had zero problems with it in my HERO3 or HERO3+.  I have had problems with SanDisk Ultra 64GB cards and cannot recommend them (I have friends who have also had issues with SanDisk Ultra cards in their GoPros).For those of you who are concerned about the talk of a ""focus issue"" with the HERO3+ Black Edition mentioned in some reviews, I suggest that you don't listen to the negative reviews without checking out the comment section of this review for links to direct head to head video comparisons of the HERO3+ Black Edition vs the HERO3 Black Edition (I can't post links in the main review).

"Based on my many years of experience, I consider myself to be an electronics expert.  I can tell you that good power protection is an important, relatively inexpensive investment that can save you thousands of dollars and even more importantly, help to protect the life of your priceless electronic memories.  I do recommend that if you're going to invest thousands of dollars in an audio system or an expensive big-screen tv or a high performance computer, yes, absolutely, get a good surge protector to protect that investment from extreme events and every day power woes.  Or even better, get a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply).  But this specific device, with it's claims of ""Enhance the Performance of Your Video Display,"" I cannot justify.  It's simply dishonest hype.At the time of this review, Amazon is selling this two outlet, surge surpressor/line conditioner for $110.For $105 you can get a CyberPower 1000VA/600W UPS with EMI/RFI filtering, RJ11/45 & Coax Protection and nine outlets!  An excellent, more versatile, battery back up system for about the same price!For a little more money, $135, you can get the even better CyberPower 1350VA/810W UPS with with EMI/RFI filtering, RJ11/45 & Coax Protection and eight outlets!

Again, a battery backed UPS, not just a surge protector.Based on its actual specs, the lack of hard proof of any of its dubious claims, and knowing full well they are not true, I cannot recommend this product.

"A trimmer is something I don't want to think too much about.  I just want it work when I need it to.  I don't want to spend time wondering if the unit is charged, if it's charged too much or if the battery is near depletion.  Unfortunately, with this otherwise perfectly nice unit, you'll have to keep on top of the battery condition because this trimmer doesn't do that for you.The first problem I have is that according to the manual, it takes ten hours of charging to every one hour of usage!  10 hours charging for 1 hour of use?  Seriously?Second, the battery management is so bad, that the unit has no way to even let you know when it is fully charged.  In fact, there is no battery life indicator of any kind.  When you plug the trimmer in to charge it, a light near the plug base slowly blinks.  Sounds promising, right?  But to quote the manual and counter to all reasonable logic, ""After the trimmer is fully charged, the charging light will continue to blink.""  Really?  That seems perfectly logical and modern... NOT.  Why didn't they use an inexpensive circut to stop charging the battery once it's fully charged? ?  ???  Really?  How is anyone supposed to KNOW when/if the battery is fully charged then?  Should I summon Karnak the Magnificent?But it gets worse.  Yes, because according to the manual ""Continuously recharging the trimmer will reduce the lifespan of the battery"" and ""Do not charge for more than 24 hours"" and ""...do not recharge the trimmer between trimming sessions - continue using it until the battery is completely empty"" and ""Do not keep the cord permanently plugged in"" and ""Discharge/run down the battery completely twice a year by letting the motor run until it stops""Basically, if you don't manage this charging game well, you'll kill the Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery prematurely.  According to a very well known, major manufacturer of electronics and batteries, ""extensive trickle charging (of NiMH batteries) can cause battery deterioration due to overcharging, and it is the least preferred charging method concerning battery performance.""I don't know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need it.It's a shame because other than that, it's a nice unit.  It's light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it's easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.

Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31B208Z57PKOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NHYQAS#wasThisHelpful","R31B208Z57PKOG","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have to move a lot of data between computers or wish to carry a lot of software or music or movies or backups around in your pocket (and protect it with hardware-based encryption), this may be the drive for you.  It's small and light enough to fit in your shirt pocket (though I wouldn't recommend that) and it has a large, 500GB capacity!  The drive gets its power through the USB cable, so there is no separate power cable to carry or plug in - only a small USB cable (which is included).  Just plug the drive into your laptop or desktop computer's USB port, install the included encryption driver and go.  About the only thing not impressive about this drive is that it's not the fastest drive in the world - its speed is limited by both the USB 2.0 connection and the slow, low RPM (low power) drive itself - so the high capacity and portability has some trade-offs.  The included USB cable is really short (18""), so if you need a bit more length, you'll have to purchase a separate USB to Micro USB cable.  Finally, just plugging the drive in prompts Windows to request for the installation of Western Digital's SES device driver to your PC.  The SES device driver handles the drive's optional 256-bit hardware encryption.  I have no use for the encryption, so I didn't wish to install the SES driver.  Unfortunately, if you do that, you'll be prompted to install the driver whenever you plug the drive in or restart your system.  I never allowed it to install and I don't want it to install so I disabled the SES device in Windows' device manager to stop the prompts.  The average person may not know how to do that.  All in all, if you can live with the relatively low speed, or if you want a portable drive with encrypted data, or you need to move or carry a lot of data or backups around, especially for a laptop, this may be the drive for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285NFC5TND5WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZK5NZY#wasThisHelpful","R285NFC5TND5WP","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a serious hair dryer, no compromise here.  It's ergonomic, nicely balanced and although it's heavier than my previous dryer, it's also much more powerful.  I like the fact that it has a removable filter on the back for easy cleaning.  I also like the cold air setting which my previous dryer lacked completely, including a separate quick ""cold shot"" trigger you can activate at any time.  You can customize the heat/speed easily since the heat and speed are controlled by separate rocker switches.  The controls are easy to use, but because of their location and easy movement, you may occasionally change either the heat or the speed setting unintentionally while using it.  I find myself getting used to holding it more and more so that doesn't happen.  Most importantly, this thing has power.  It can really move some air and get that air nice and hot, too.  The outside stays relatively cool.  Interestingly, it's not as loud as my previous dryer either.  If you can get over the color scheme they used, dark purply brown with pink trim, this is a great hair dryer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M9RAQW8G8QBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V264WW#wasThisHelpful","R1M9RAQW8G8QBT","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Cottonelle for years, and I can say without hesitation that this is a superior product.  Don't let the fact that this is single-ply get in the way of trying this... it's strong, it's soft enough without being so soft that it disintegrates easily and most importantly, it doesn't shred either.  Since it is single ply, you don't run into a badly spooled split-ply like I would with Cottonelle sometimes.  Another observation is that unlike Cottonelle, you don't get a fine paper mill dust with it that ends up accumulating on the floor - this is a clean product.  These double rolls fit the fixture just fine without any issue.  Let's face it, we all use TP.

"I had high hopes when I opened the box.  The device was light, sleek and attractive (for a laptop cooler). Unfortunately, I immediately discovered some major flaws.I plugged the device into my Lenovo Thinkpad R40 which tends to run hot.  There is no mention of this on the Amazon product page, but there is no A/C power adapter included.  The product is designed to draw power directly from your laptop via a split, dual USB cable included with the unit.  If your laptop is short on free USB ports, this could be a deal breaker.  You can use one or both USB leads to power the cooler.  They recommend using both for ""maximum cooling,"" but I only detected a slight difference in the max fan speed when using both USB leads as opposed to using only one (that was while the laptop was plugged into a/c power - there might be a more discernible differerence on some laptops, especially if running from battery power).  But that is the least of your concerns.The cooler has a small, on/off/speed adjustment dial on the right-front side near a tiny, bright, white LED light to let you know when the unit is on (at least theoretically).  I turned the switch so it clicked on and the three 80mm x 10mm fans spin up for a split second and then they stop.  They stopped?  Yes, they stopped.  Hence the unit's first major flaw.  The fans will only actually run at medium to max speed.  Instead of the fans running slowly and silently and then steadily increasing in speed as you turn the dial, I had to turn the dial to max to get the fans to spin up at all and then dial it back to get any speed other than stop or max.  Even then, if you dial it back too far, the fans will just stop.  There really isn't a slient, low speed.I say they are cheapy made fans because of the second major flaw - the fans on my unit buzz, whir and generally make noise.  One of the three fans on my unit even sounds like it's completely unbalanced to the point where it actually makes a clicking noise at lower speeds.  At max RPM, the fans all straighten up and spin right, but they are noisy fans at max RPM.  They make your laptop sound almost like a desktop pc.Even at max RPM, the cooling provided by this mat is again limited by the fact that the fans are only moving air in a straight line of 80mm x 280mm as the three fans are all lined up in a row close to the rear of the unit.  This is the third major flaw.  If your laptop generates heat or has air intakes in the front, the middle or just nowhere near the main area of airflow in the rear, the Chill Mat will be far less effective for you.  It will provide some amount of cooling, but less than I had hoped.Also note that the description boasts that the ""Grill is constructed of anodized 2040 aluminum alloy"" - but it is only a very thin, surface layer of aluminum bonded to plastic.  90+% of this unit is plastic.  Again, attractive, but not made of aluminum.In my opinion, the flaws are unacceptable for a $60 laptop cooler.  The average person may not even realize that the fans have stopped spinning at a low setting when they are expecting this unit to reliably cool their laptop, let alone an expensive ""gaming"" laptop.  It only works reliably at or near max rpm and then the unit produces a lot of noise.  Even then, it will typically provide only very limited cooling due to the small area in which the fans operate.  I don't think I would recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKW4K0MJ2LXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSHKJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2TKW4K0MJ2LXI","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First thing I'll note is that the packaging for this device is supremely stupid.  It's made of that thin, clear, tough plastic that can have sharp edges, doesn't play well with fingers and it's of a size and complexity that is completely unnecessary for a device of this size - small!  They should have put this in a small, printed cardboard box without all the unnecessary plastic, layers and compartments.Getting past the packaging, you'll see that unit is very small and compact - 2 & 7/8"" long by 1.25"" wide by 3/8"" thick.  The LCD display covers most of the front and there are four rather spongy, rubber buttons along the right side.  Overall the unit is very light and it feels solid.  After you insert the included CR2032 button battery, you'll have to provide the unit with a few pieces of info to set it up.  First the measurement units - either metric or standard.  Then enter your weight, stride length and the time of day.  You can measure your average stride length by marking a point on the floor, taking five or ten steps, measuring the distance, and then dividing the distance you travelled by the number of steps you took.  The more steps you use for your measurement, the more accurate the unit will be - though realize that however accurate you are, this measure can only serve as an approximation.  That's it!  Now you can carry the device in your pocket or purse and it will measure your walking activity - just don't let it swing freely from the included lanyard which will cause it to be inaccurate as it measures inertia.The basic display is large and clear.  It displays the amount of steps you've taken since 2am that day and the current time.  You can press the ""mode"" button to display the total approxmiate distance you've travelled and the approximate number of calories you've burned that day.  You can also press the ""mem"" button and then use the up/down and mode buttons to review and compare your activity through the past fourteen days.  There is also a small bar meter along the bottom you can view during activity which will indicate how fast or slow it thinks your moving at that time - of course, the faster you move, the more calories you are burning.The battery is supposed to last for about a year and the unit will shut down the display during periods of inactivity - though the unit is always on and measuring your movements - there is no manual on/off control.If you're looking for a pedometer, this device seems to work pretty well.  It's small, light, solid feeling and easy to read.  My only negatives are the spongy buttons they used and the terribly unfriendly, unnecessary packaging.  Overall, I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7EWJX07963O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VQK0HS#wasThisHelpful","RT7EWJX07963O","A2240J73FTPR21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2240J73FTPR21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not really happy with these.  I like my pens to feel solid with absolutely no play in the mechanism.  Unfortunately, I feel there is a just a bit of play when putting these pens to paper which I don't like and I can't tighten that play out.  Once you do make contact, the pen does write very smoothly.  But unfortunately, the ink does not dry immediately and it could take some time to set depending on the surface, so you have to be careful not to smudge what you've already written - for me, this is a deal breaker.  The pens do have a rubber grip and I was expecting more of a soft cushion, but the rubber layer is very thin so there is very little cushioning effect for your fingertips.

"Love it!  It immediately solved a problem on a day trip during which we needed to use our GPS due to frequent non-reception areas for our cell phones (therefore, no map program availability), and also needed to charge both of our cell phones.  With only two 12v power outlets in our vehicle, this allowed everything to happen at once.  The blue light around the outside of the unit is nice to know for sure that the unit is powered, particularly with one 12v outlet powered all the time, and the other only powered when the engine is running.  Having a cord included was a big plus (we already had one cord in the vehicle for use, but would have been caught short when it became apparent that both phones needed charging toward the end of the trip.  I'm not one to easily pass out a 5-star rating unless a product is among the best options in terms of price/functionality/design.  This met our needs nicely, since we don't have iPhones (note that there are different purchase options for compatibility, so don't blame the unit if you didn't order the right one).  Finally, the power rating is quite welcome - too often, less expensive similar products are lower power, meaning longer charging times, etc.NOTE: If this does not last over time, I will automatically update this review with a significantly lower rating.  There are always going to be a few defective units with any product, but generally electronic items fail quickly or last a long time.  This was used continuously for almost all of a day-trip, with no overheating of the phones or cord, and no failure.

"If you ever want to save bacon grease, you cannot do it with this product.  If you just want a simple way of draining it off your bacon, leaving it less greasy, this will do a nice job.  The product is basically a 2-layer product, with the inner (upper) layer being perforated to allow the grease to drip down into the lower portion at the bottom.  When you're done, just throw out the entire pay (it's a single use product).At the current listed price on Amazon, you're paying $1.67 for a single cooking of bacon strips, just for the convenience of not having to lay out a far less expensive sheet of aluminum foil on a cookie sheet (or similar), pull the corners up and fold the sides up just a bit to hold the grease, then fold all that up carefully after cooking is done and throwing it out the same as you would with this product.  Very little extra effort, and far less expensive.  And there's very little else you could probably use this product for.Also, what about recycling?  Aluminum is recyclable, but somehow the grease should be drained out (and separately recycled) before this is put in a recycle bin (I just verified that with a recycling company).  Do NOT pour the grease down the drain (bad for your plumbing, even worse for your city's sewer system).The definition of three stars is, ""It's okay.""  So I gave it three stars based on its intended purpose only.  It accomplishes it  Otherwise, it's an expensive way to do bacon and creates a recycling problem if you don't go through the trouble of cutting out a corner and draining as much grease as possible before recycling it.  We will not buy it ourselves.  While we're not environmentalist whackos, we do what we reasonably can to preserve, recycle, etc.  This is a wasteful and, frankly, an environmentally irresponsible product from a major corporation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BS4OT68TE2ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UN39MI#wasThisHelpful","R2BS4OT68TE2ZE","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own the black version of this same model, so this review directly applies to this watch also (only difference is silver vs. black face).The dial is fairly easily readable, but there are several problems with it. The TINY date window in the center of the circular area at 6:00 is very hard to read anyway, and if either the hour or minute hand are near the 6:00 position, the date window is completely covered. Even when not covered, the date is so small that it's almost impossible to read unless the watch is held up close. Even worse, within an hour of midnight you can't tell what the date is - the date slowly rotates toward the next date as that final hour of the day passes. The date function is purely mechanical, with 31 numbers on it so five out of twelve months you'll have to reset your watch by moving the date forward on the last day of the month.The circle around the date window has 12 metal dots around the outside of it like a clock face, suggesting that perhaps that's a second-hand window of some sort. They're simply decorations with an extremely tuny date window in the middle. You get hours and minutes by the two conventional hands - that's it.Setting the watch? Extremely difficult. Pull the stem out all the way and set the hours and minutes (but make sure you know whether you just passed 12:00 noon or 12:00 midnight, or your date window will be changing at noon rather than midnight). Setting the date is extremely difficult. I could feel no intermediate ""click"" when pulling out the stem part way to set the date. If you don't get it just right, you won't be moving the date window, but will be moving the hour and minute hands and have to reset them again. Don't be confused by the printed instructions - you do NOT have to screw out the crown (stem). You'll just pull it out like most older style conventional, mechanically set watches.Finally, the clasp. Despite considerable education and some very technical positions in life, I simply could not figure out how the clasp works. The metal ""thing"" attached under the band simply makes no sense without any instructions (and there are none with the watch). I finally had to call the company. Be sure to save the little tag attached to the watch with the model number on it - you will need that for the customer support person. (Alternately, the watch model is printed in very tiny letters/numbers on the back of the watch case.)The trick is to look carefully at the 4th photo on the Amazon product page, noticing that BOTH sides of the metal piece under the leather band unsnap from the band to open up much wider so it can slip over your wrist. You can't on the watch and then adjust the band to insert the little pin in the proper hole in the leather band in order to fit it to your wrist. You GUESS at the size of the watch band when fully closed, fit the pin through the hole you think might work in the band, then open up both sides of the metal clasp underneath, slip the band over your wrist, re-snap the metal clasp closed, and then slip the end of the leather band through the small straps across the band to keep it from flapping loose (that part is just like a normal leather watch band after you've gotten all the other operations done). When the company representative told me to fit the band BEFORE putting it on my wrist, I had no idea what she was talking about. She said there's an internet page that shows how to do it, but when you go to the web site listed in the instruction insert, it simply says the web site is ""coming soon."" I have not been able to find any other instructions following a fairly substantial web search. Fortunately, the representative finally said something - I don't even remember what - that made me realize that the metal portion of the clasp that goes underneath the band, snaps and unsnaps in a way somewhat similar to a traditional all-metal watch band that unsnaps, unfolds, and then can be slipped off the wrist, reversing that action to put it back on again. Still, the end of the leather strap has to be fully removed from under the two leather retention bands across the main band, in order to undo the watch band from your wrist. Once you've put the watch back on and re-snapped both sides of the metal portion of the band underneath, you then have to slide the leather portion back under the retaining bands just like a ""normal"" leather watch band.Even adjusting the leather portion of the strap initially to get the metal pin through the proper hold is a very, very difficult task, until you realize that the metal band that goes across the top of the leather band has an unsnap feature of its own. That allows somewhat (relatively speaking) easier open of that metal area so the leather strap will slide through it without immediately catching the pin in the first or second leather strap hole. You then guesstimate which hole to stick the retaining pin through on the leather band, snap the metal retaining band down tight again, and proceed to figure out the metal retention mechanism down underneath the leather strap.If all that sounds confusing, it's because it truly is! I cannot describe a more logical set of instructions even now that I've done it a few times. It's the most non-user-friendly thing I've ever seen. And the representative on the phone said, ""Don't feel bad. You're not at all the first person that has called about this."" I suspect that was an understatement.... It would take a slow, stop-action video, with excellent verbal description and arrows pointing to various pieces on the band for a user to fairly easily follow operation of this band. I hate to belabor this point, but the clasp mechanism and strap are just absurd. Another reviewer said it would be difficult for a person with arthritis or some other manual dexterity problem - I fully concur.Would I spend a little over $60 for this watch if I knew what was involved in using it every day? Not a chance, despite the fact that the basic appearance is quite nice (disregarding an almost unreadable date, and no second hand). The $395 ""list price"" is one of the most absurd jokes I've ever seen on any product. This is by far the most inconvenient watch I've ever owned (I've owned many watches over many years, including expensive watches such as a self-winding Hamilton that I still have from nearly 50 years ago). I've just never seen anything this non-user friendly or poorly designed in my life, masquerading as a quality time piece.At least it has a 5-year warranty, as long as you keep your proof of purchase and send them $15.00 along with the watch you paid to ship to them, including insurance. BUT - warranty exclusions? Everything is excluded EXCEPT the movement itself. The warranty ""does NOT cover the watch case, bracelet, strap, crystal, battery or crown, pushers or stem of the watch."" So if the stem stops working to set the date or time in the next five years - not covered. And if you have to replace the battery in that five year period, you must contact the company to find an ""Authorized Lucien Piccard Repair Center."" Failure to let one of those people replace your battery will void your warranty. Nowhere do the watch case or printed instruction sheet provide you with the battery type. Why do I suppose that replacing the watch battery might be far more expensive than with almost any other watch?I recognize that this is probably the most negative review I've ever given a product. I'm not usually that way, even when I don't like a product. But this product is so poorly designed, with almost no documentation to tell you how to properly set it up, and with a very exclusionary warranty that will still cost you money to get it fixed (after you insure and pay to ship it), that I simply cannot give it any more than a solid 1-star review. And be aware that as you read the ""Product Description"" on Amazon, you're really only reading a generalized description of Lucien Piccard watches, and many of the features in the ""Description"" do not apply to this watch. And again, be CERTAIN to study the 4th product photo on Amazon carefully, so you can get an idea of how the metal closure mechanism works. It snaps shut on BOTH sides, once you've put it on your wrist, and then you slide the leather band back into the retention straps on the other side.Oh - unlike another reviewer, I did find that it keeps accurate time. After two weeks, it's spot on. But I still can't bring myself to upgrade it to two stars. If I'd had to pay for this watch (I'm an Amazon Vine reviewer), I would never have even considered it, knowing what I now know about it. And if it fails within five years, I would not even bother trying to get a warranty replacement or repair. It's that bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BN42Z7EJL2X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXIJ5M#wasThisHelpful","R1BN42Z7EJL2X9","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very attractive watch.  Setting it was fairly easy (be sure to choose the correct set of instructions in the booklet that comes with it).  Compared with another watch I got recently, the instructions are FAR easier to understand (and they're accurate).  So far, it appears to keep virtually perfect time.The instructions for operating the closure are also quite easy to understand (and it's fairly intuitive even without the instructions, unlike the above-mentioned previous watch.  And if you have a decent jeweler's screwdriver set, you will not need to take it to a watch shop to have links removed or the clasp adjusted.  Those were very easy.  It takes a very tiny jeweler's screwdriver to unscrew the pins that hold the links together, but once they're out, it's easy to remove and rejoin the links to fit your wrist.  A paper clip will work just fine to push in the spring-tip pin in the clasp to adjust it.  Within minutes of arrival, I had three links removed and the clasp adjusted to fit my somewhat small wrist.  There aren't any instructions in the booklet for this, but it's quite obvious what needs to be done.  If one has ever pushed in a pin to remove a watch band, and then replace the band and the pin to hold it to the watch, that's all that's needed on the clasp adjustment.  And instead of spring-loaded pins on the links, it's a simple screw-out/screw-in pin.  Just make sure you use the proper size screwdriver in order not to strip the pin end, and also make sure it's properly tightened.Be aware this is a BIG watch.  Look at the specs on the product page and picture it on your wrist.  It will not fit nicely over the cuff of a long sleeve shirt.  But that's a style many like these days, so it's simply personal preference.  Just be aware that unless your long sleeve shirt cuffs are fairly large, the shirt is unlikely to fit over the watch and down past your wrist.  With some sort of sport shirt or short sleeve shirt, it would be fine, and look great!My one real complaint is visibility of the actual time.  It cannot be read in the dark.  And the black pointers on the minute and hour hands, with a fairly dark grey background, make it difficult to see the time in anything other than fairly decent lighting.  It appears that the crystal may be a bit tinted, but that may just be because the overall color scheme is silver/grey.  Regardless, in low light it will be somewhat difficult to tell time, and in the dark it will be impossible.This last remark is more of a personal preference.  This is a HEAVY watch, not just in appearance, but in actual weight.  I have a cheap Casio multi-function watch for general use that weights 1.8 oz.  This beast weighs in at over ½ pound (8.2 oz)!  It's going to take some getting used to, I think.  <grin>  But I do like the looks of it.  It's a very substantial looking watch - it just unfortunately carries the weight that goes with it (and perhaps even then some!).With those last two items in mind, if you otherwise like the watch, I can recommend it (unlike the one I gave a 1-star review to not long ago).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRY2OU4B91NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445IESQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SRY2OU4B91NB","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The set is attractive, and will clearly do the job.  It replaces a set with one less wrench in it, so having the extra size will be nice.  The main shafts on these are rather thin and narrow, compared to ""old style"" wrenches, but presumably will hold up just fine.  The carrying case is VERY handy.  Yes, it's ""just"" a piece of plastic, but it's well designed and allows all of the wrenches to fit in a compact area, with easy removal.  The end of the case even functions very nicely as a hand grip for the entire set.The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star product for me is that the inner surfaces of the closed end wrenches are a bit more rounded than my old set (which had a bit more of a distinct angle on the high spots).  I'm concerned that with a somewhat worn nut or bolt that this may slip easier, but so far I haven't found anything to really test it out on.  It's made in China, and NOT what some of us older guys remember as Crescent quality - but then that's getting pretty universal for most products anymore.  ""They just don't make 'em like used to,"" as the saying goes.Overall, this is a nice set, and for the price, quite worth the selling price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJIXQCUIBHBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXX8MNC#wasThisHelpful","R2QJIXQCUIBHBM","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very pleased.  It's a foot longer than the original (supplied) Apple cable, and the right-angle keeps the cord from bending as much during data transfer or charging.  I consider it almost borderline for deserving to also have a charging brick, given the retail price, but not quite.  Still, it's longer than some cords, designed specifically for Apple products, and seems sturdy enough, so what's not to like?

"Very, very comfortable, and incoming sound quality really is excellent.  Outside noise is also very nicely reduced despite the fact that these are on the ear, rather than over the ear.Several callers reported that sound was lower volume than with just my regular cell phone microphone, but that the volume was acceptable (therefore not as easy to understand.  However, I learned that I could loop the cord over one speaker and the microphone will hang almost right next to the mouth, and sound quality is better.  However, I have had my wife call me with it plugged into her phone,  and personally listened to the difference between this unit's microphone and her cell phone (identical model to mine), and the difference is very, very significant (FAR better when using the phone microphone directly, compared to this unit).  It just would have been better to put the microphone up higher in the line in the first place (it is the lower black element on the cord in the photo).Also, the plug is a 1/8"" plug, so it will not fit many cordless home phones (such as our Panasonic system).  A far less expensive (and far lower quality) headset we purchased for my wife to use with one of our home phones also came with an adapter so either a 1/8"" plug OR a sub-mini (2.5mm) plug could be used.  At the cost of this unit, a $2.00 adapter should be included!Would I spend the kind of money this set is currently selling for on Amazon?  No.  The only exception might be if I was a frequent flyer, for example, or often listened to music with a headset, and well over $200 was not an issue.  Then I might consider it because of the incoming audio sound quality and the comfort.  Given the incredible reported frequency response, for example, this is truly an amazing piece of equipment.  Few people will fully appreciate just how good it is, because few ever expect (or even know to want) the kind of performance this is advertised to provide - and apparently does.  Music is wonderful with these!  But the more I've used the microphone with my cell phone, the more complaints I get.So, put the microphone higher (to give better output volume to the other person on a phone call), add an adapter to fit the other common size of plugs for devices this might be frequently used with, and this would be a 5-star product without question.  I shouldn't have to figure out how to loop the cord over one ear piece just to give the person at the other end of a call adequate volume to listen to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGYSXLVQFZEVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3A0LLE#wasThisHelpful","RGYSXLVQFZEVT","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not only are they at least as good as any other parchment paper she's used, but they also lay flat - a nice change from parchment paper cut from a roll.

I gently squeezed a half-full jug of full strength bleach with the mask on my face and IMMEDIATELY over the opening of the jug.

"I've been using these for many years in the dryer that came with my Trans-Ear device for single-sided deafness (the same audiologist invented both devices).  My Trans-Ear (a specialized type of hearing aid) has lasted many years between very rare occasions where maintenance or repair were needed.  I attribute that at least in part to the superior reduction in possible moisture-related problems with the drying device and these dessicant ""Briks.""  HIGHLY recommended for any type of hearing aids.I will note here that I am a patient of the inventor of this and the Trans-Ear by choice.  I started out as the patient of an audiologist locally, with terrible results (and nearly gave up on my Trans-Ear ""hearing aid"").  But I chose to drive a full day, several states away, stay overnight, and become a patient of the inventor (who owns Ear Technology, Inc.), and could not be more pleased.  So I've got that association solely by choice, but without any prompting on his part, let alone any compensation.  This review is given solely as the result of a purchase on Amazon, and without knowledge of anyone at Ear Technology.

"I certainly would not pay more than the lowest price currently showing on Amazon for this device.  It's functional, but not terribly convenient.  The audio isn't going to rival a Bose, but shouldn't be expected to.  Still, it's more ""tinny"" than I would expect from modern electronics.  I have a Bluetooth speaker that's around this same price and size, and the sound quality is amazing - this is ""adequate"" at best.  For emergency use, it's fine.Tuning is a royal pain, to be quite honest.  There is no possible way to move quickly from FM 88.x up to FM 107.x, for example (or AM 540 up to around AM 1600).  You have to push the channel ""up"" button once per channel frequency.  In other words, if you wanted to go from the bottom of the FM band (88.0 mHz) to 89.0, it would require ten button pushes just for that short span of frequencies.  There is a rapid-tune feature whereby if you press and hold the frequency up or down buttons the radio will then cycle up/down automatically through all the intervening frequencies until it finds the next broadcasting station.  But If you're in a larger city with many, many stations, the rapid-tune feature would be equally frustrating, because you'd have to re-start the ""seek"" feature every time it stopped on a new station, and hope the station you want isn't at the other end of the band (AM or FM).The crank charging is definitely JUST an emergency feature.  It is not something you'd want to do for very long (there's a fair amount of resistance as you crank), and you only get about 1 minute of talk time on your cell phone for every 4 minutes of cranking time if you need a charge on your cell phone, for example.  Or you get about 10-15 minutes of radio time for every 4 minutes of cranking time.  Fortunately, you can charge this product with the included USB cord, plugged into a wall adapter or the USB output on your computer (remember, that would drain the computer battery though, if not plugged into a wall socket).The LED flashlight is definitely not going to light up a tent, for example.  Would it get you around in the dark if needed?  Yes, but you'd have to go slowly and look very carefully.  It's not at all brightIncluded is a little carrying strap that is designed to loop through two holes on one corner of the radio.  I was never able to push the cord through to the other hole so it could be looped back on itself and actually used.  I ended up having to use a jeweler's screwdriver to loosen both case screws at that end of the radio, use a separate flat blade screw driver to pry and hold open the case, then slip the carrying strap through the larger gap between the two sides so it's threaded between the two holes intended for its use.  Then the screws were tightened back and the strap was looped over itself in order to be used.  Again, poor design - why not just install the strap before shipping it out?The little rubber cover on the bottom hiding the two USB ports and earphone jack is perpetually loose.  It does not hold itself in place very well at all.The radio does seem to have pretty decent reception on the weather and FM bands, but exceptionally poor on AM - you're only going to get very local stations there.Overall, adequate for an emergency kit or when the power is out.  It does have an alarm feature on the weather band for whenever the National Weather Service issues an alert of some sort, which would be nice in a situation where power is out and storms are in the area.  But for everyday use, this is NOT the item you'd want.  Tuning stations is, all by itself, a deal-killer if you thought of using this for general use.  There's no way to put in a specific frequency for one desired station - you simply have to push the button and wade through the entire band to find your desired station.I gave this a 3-star rating, meaning it is probably worth having, but it simply isn't worth what several places are charging for it, and would not be my first choice for such a device.  Perhaps a good three-word summary would be ""adequate but underwhelming.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBHGQERRIITU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTKQ1P4#wasThisHelpful","R1VBHGQERRIITU","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It might be helpful that - until recently - Epson was the ONLY printer we would recommend to anyone.  We've owned more Epsons than we can count, for over two decades, starting with our first dot matrix printer, and including an Epson 600, 777, R300, WF7520, 1400, and others.  We've used their inks in the past, and finally started using one specific company's inks many years ago because they had such high reviews from professional photographers.  Plus, their inks were FAR less expensive than Epson's, particularly when we did our own refilling.  So this review is coming from someone that would not every buy any other brand of printer - until now.We got a different model for our daughter a few months ago, and it died after a week.  Epson very quickly (just two days) sent her a replacement at no cost, and didn't required return of the old one (it was a less expensive model).  No problem.  Occasional problems happen.Then I purchased an Epson 3640 at Office Depot, and as always, declined the extended warranty, figuring I had 14 days to figure out if it worked and I could still bring it back without a shipping hassle.  We've saved so much in extended warranty fees over the years, that we'll just have to ""eat"" this one.From the start, the color quality was poor on this printer, but despite my long years of experience with many Epson printers, I simply could not figure out what the problem was.  It started with the Epson original cartridges.  I switched to our ""old faithful"" 3rd party ink company, first with their remanufactured Epson cartridges.  The problem continued.  They sent me, at their cost, replacement cartridges (they use the Epson WF3620 at their own tech services desk, with those very cartridges!).  It appeared to be a printer problem, but they didn't want to put me through the hassle of having Epson trying to blame 3rd party ink and not honoring the warranty.  They even (again at their expense) then sent me a full set of refillable cartridges, full of ink, since we're already used to using that ink in our other printers.  Same problem with ink not feeding first black, then later magenta.  The troubleshooting was far more extensive than Epson ever would have asked me to do - by their own admission once I finally had to call Epson.Epson customer service?  Absolutely no complaint.  They listened to my experience with Epson over the years, as well as the 3rd party ink, and the extensive troubleshooting that other company took me through first, and almost immediately agreed that it was a printer problem  They did, to protect themselves, put a $179.99 HOLD on my credit card until they got the first printer back, but that never converted to an actual charge, as promised, and disappeared within a day of the old printer arriving at Epson.  And I received the replacement three days after I called - with FedEx shipping of a 33 pound box at their expense, both ways.  What else could I ask for?!2nd printer: Dead On Arrival with a 0x69 error code straight out of the box.  2nd call to Epson: again, absolutely superb customer service.  I didn't even ask for it, and they sent the 3rd printer OVERNIGHT by FedEx - again, at their expense, with return of the 2nd printer at their expense of course.  That's almost unheard of customer service, anymore.  Too bad that same ethic doesn't apply on the manufacturing side of Epson.3rd printer: worked OK initially, including using our usual 3rd party ink once the original (absurdly over-priced) Epson cartridges ran out.  Then it started all over again - exactly what happened with the first printer.  This time it was cyan - the ink simply would not flow - at all.  I'm highly familiar with these refillable cartridges, but called the ink company to see if they had any other ideas.  I pulled 1cc of ink out the bottom just in case there was air there, and had no problem with ink coming through.  I then blotted the hole dry with tissue and reinstalled it.  No change, except that there was more ink in the hole when I pulled the cartridge back out, clearly showing that ink was coming FROM the cartridge - it just won't feed through the printer what Epson acknowledged was a hardware issue when that happened with the first printer).So: Epson lost their money for the printer they sold to Office Depot, because they paid for a 33 pound box to be shipped FedEx Ground three times, and one other time at overnight rates.  And I lost my money on the printer because I rolled the dice and lost by not buying the extended warranty from Office Depot.  Office Depot got my money, so they're the only winner.  And I'm not saying I will never, ever, again trust Epson.  They simply are not the same company they used to be.  When our 1400 and WF7520 finally wear out or die, they will be replaced by something other than Epson from then on.Roughly a quarter century of top notch experience with Epson printers is now history.  I don't know what changed, but don't care.  They're junk.  Just read the reviews, not just this one disgruntled customer's trashing of this printer model.  Remember, I've got decades of previous top notch experience with the company.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MEAGJJ915AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGEUC#wasThisHelpful","R17MEAGJJ915AA","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both cartridges were apparently over-filled (I thought), and would not feed the tape to print it.  The machine could not pull the tape out of the cartridge for some reason.  Eventually, after tugging gently on the tape, I figured there was nothing to lose, so I grabbed and pulled very hard.  Finally, the tape barely began to be pulled from the inside, and after I'd wasted a foot of tape (a full 10% of the entire roll), it was loose enough that the machine could feed it properly.  After that, printing was fine.When I inspected the cartridges more closely, I saw that the inside of the cartridge is fairly visible from one side, and there is clearly a huge amount of empty space on the inside of the tape area, so it's not a matter of being over-filled.  These are only 10 foot tapes, whereas I  currently have a 23 foot black-on-white cartridge that has exactly the same amount of space inside the cartridge for tape.  With the much longer tape, it simply winds further inside the empty space, leaving less space in the middle of the circular area containing the remaining tape.  For whatever reason, these two cartridges have the tape very tightly pushed up against the outside edge of the circular area containing the tape supply, and the inside end of the tape isn't loosely unwinding itself into the middle to give the tape some slack (like it does with the 23 foot long cartridge).Bottom line: if you have the same problem of the machine trying to print but nothing comes out, grab the colored portion (not the black character tape underneath it in the cartridge) and pull it as hard as you have to, to get it started.  Once you've pulled it far enough to be able to feel that it's feeding fairly easily, try re-installing the cartridge and it will probably work fine.  It's just sad to have to waste 10% of the entire supply on both cartridges in this package.ADDED: As a Vine reviewer, I do not see the selling price, and hadn't gone to look at that before the review.  Before this edit, I had rated this a 3-star product because of the wasted tape due to the apparent internal defect in both cartridges.  I have now downgraded it to a 2-star rating after seeing the price.  I already own one of these Dymo label makers, and recently ordered a black-on-white cartridge that is 23 feet long (more than the combined total of these two cartridges).  As with prior cartridges, there were no problems with the tape feeding, unlike these two shorter (10' ""Neon"" cartridges).  Yet the price of the 23' tape is only 54% of these two 10' tapes (20' combined).  There's no way that more than twice as much tape should be half the price of a double-pack of the same tape just because they're using different colors in the plastic.  Yes, the two cartridges cost pennies more than one cartridge package, but they're selling in bulk, thus saving costs there on packaging.Worse, I just recently ordered (and received) a replacement 23' cartridge because the old one was getting close to empty.  After doing the initial review of this Vine product, I decided to see if it feeds OK.  It does not!  It too had to be pulled out of the cartridge, though not as far as the 10' cartridges, before it would feed automatically during printing.  It appears that Dymo has a manufacturing problem that goes well beyond these new little 10' ""neon"" cartridges.  The problem is now also in the old standard 23' cartridges as well - a fundamental manufacturing issue.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTJTKZ09GADY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y4S5KPE#wasThisHelpful","R2PTJTKZ09GADY","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Instructions are very limited, and someone not familiar with replacing wiper blades would be quite frustrated.  But preliminary experience with the actual product is very positive.  I recently had to replace my blades during a long cross-country trip, and the truck stop where I purchased my replacements was out of the higher quality brand, so I had to get their ""bargain"" wiper blades.  They were just ""OK"" for the rest of the trip.  Since I was only able to get one 18"" blade through the Vine program, I installed it and had to leave the other 24"" ""bargain"" brand on the other side.  What a difference!!  While I have no way of knowing the longevity of the product at this point, Bosch products have typically been associated with high quality.  And the initial performance of this blade is excellent.  I really, really want to give it a 5-star rating, but because of the very poor installation instructions (not even as good as the ""bargain"" brand I got at the truck stop on my trip), I just can't do it.  Just be aware that if you're experienced at installing replacement wiper blades, or don't mind experimenting to figure out which insert to use, or don't mind measuring your wiper arm to determine if it's 7mm or 8mm, this is a top notch product.  Otherwise, be prepared to be frustrated until you get the thing to finally go on properly - then you'll love it.  I trust it to perform well long term, simply because of the Bosch reputation (and my experience with them over the years).  If it fails in just a few months, I'll downgrade this review.  But if the review stands in a year, it means the product performed well long term, not just initially.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUH2Z8JB1P99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX40B16#wasThisHelpful","R3MUH2Z8JB1P99","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does it work, i.e. does it kill fire ants?  Apparently.  But does it really kill the queen, or just kill some ants and cause the colony to migrate?  I cannot tell, so far.  But what I do know is that I'm not going to be buying this product long term.  I stopped using Ortho products years ago when I kept noticing that I got better results with fire ants (different insecticide chemical back then) from another brand of the same chemical.  Why?  Because Ortho was using a lower concentration of the insecticide - meaning you had to keep buying more of the Ortho product to keep killing fire ants.  It turns out that this particular chemical (bifenthrin) is again at a lower concentration in the Ortho product than some other brands of fire ant treatment using bifenthrin.  This product is only .1% bifenthrin, whereas I've found some other brands that contain up to twice as much.  To me, that looks like the old reason I quit using Ortho products - less effective with the same price, requiring more purchases.Another concern I have is that Ortho does not disclose on the package which type of bifenthrin it is.  In my research (which I try to do before using any insecticide in recent years - we try to grow our veggies as organically as possible, for example, and also protect other welcome animals as much as possible), I learned that there are two types of bifenthrin - one of which is far more toxic to fire ants, but the other is far more toxic to mammals (including humans).  Ortho doesn't say which one they're using.Is bifenthrin highly toxic to humans?  Apparently not in comparison to some insecticides, including some I used to use but that have since been taken off the market years ago (before I bothered to do my own research prior to use).  But just because it's apparently less harmful to humans (and other mammals, and birds), doesn't mean it's completely safe.  And it turns out that it is also ""effective"" (i.e. lethal) with worms - which I DO want to promote around my yard.So my bottom line is that if I use a bifenthrin-based fire ant treatment in my yard, it won't be Ortho's.

"The bottles appear to be of adequate quality, the droppers are more cheaply made and apparently cannot be separated from the rubber bulb/cap for sterilization/cleaning.

Therefore, these should all be considered contaminated upon arrival because of the manufacturing process, requiring complete cleaning/sterilization before use, depending on the intended use by the end user.

"ORIGINAL REVIEW - SEE EDITED COMMENTS BELOW THESE:  The Epson XP-320 Printer is a great little printer.  It is small and compact so it doesn't take up too much space in my small office.  I have been using the wi-fi print and it's perfect.  The colors are vibrant and the speed is quite fast for something so small.  The copier works great as well.  I tried the scanner and though it's a little slow, it did a great job.  It's certainly nothing to complain about.Set-up was very easy and quick.  I love that the paper is loaded from the back instead of the front so that it doesn't have to fold up inside the printer before coming out the front again.  It prints beautifully on card-stock and doesn't jam because of being able to go straight through the printer from the back.I would definitely recommend this printer.  Based on my experience for at least 20 years with nothing but Epson printers, I expect it will last a long time and do a great job.The ONLY thing I don't like about Epson (but I understand it's true of most if not all other companies) is that their ""starter"" cartridges are filled with just a tiny bit of ink.  Even their ""regular"" cartridges are, in my opinion, way over-priced (hence the lower price on the printers - you still end up paying in the end, just longer term as you buy expensive ink cartridges that are not filled as full as they could be.  Also be aware that virtually no printers actually tell you the cartridges are empty because they're empty - it's pre-programmed to estimate when it's getting close, and generally there's till ink in the cartridges - you just can't use it.  I'm not downgrading the printer for that, because that is not unique to Epson.  We don't allow our kids to say, ""But everybody's doing it,"" yet companies basically are getting away with that logic.  Epson is no worse than others, and personally I would not have any other brand based on many printers over at least two decades (we generally have at least two printers at any given time, plus I've purchased for our church and gotten Epson).EDITED REVIEW: After working for a short while, it had a fatal error that Epson agreed could not be fixed.  Their customer service was outstanding, and the replacement printer arrived in a couple of days, literally.  The original printer didn't even have to be sent back (apparently not worth it to Epson).  The most I'm willing to give this printer now is a 3-star rating, because it didn't last but a matter of weeks with very little use.  To make matters worse, we're currently now on our THIRD (already dead) printer of a different model (a Workforce 3640) from Epson that we purchased for a different purpose (this one was for our daughter's use).After more than two decades of all-Epson printers, with high recommendations to friends and others over those years, I will not purchase or recommend Epson ever again.  Whatever happened internally, I do not know, but just look at their reviews.  For example the new Epson WF3640 has 20% 1-star reviews!  We've now received three of them, and they're all unusable.  I give up entirely on Epson, which is really hard to do after something approaching 10 Epsons over all these years in our family.  When our current (excellent) Epson 1400 and WF7520 finally need replacement, it will NOT be with Epson.  I can only hope this 2nd XP-320 doesn't die too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8XGGFBBXX47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX0R3A4#wasThisHelpful","R3L8XGGFBBXX47","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were really excited to try out this toaster, but quickly found out the limitations.  Don't expect to make a nice grilled cheese sandwich, for example.  In fact, don't expect to make a LOT of sandwiches that have two normal pieces of bread - one on each side with some sort of sandwich filling in between.  Problem?  Read the directions:""Take care when using ingredients that could melt and run out of the food item.  We do not recommend the use of high fat or similar fillings that may drip into the toaster as this will be difficult to clean.""[and]""When cutting your paninis or ciabattas etc do not cut all the way through, instead leave the bottom side uncut so that it prevents melted cheese from dripping into the toaster.""In other words, this toaster is definitely not suitable for a wide variety of different sandwiches and kinds of toast.  My wife likes to toast in a little toaster oven because she can spread butter and cheese across the top of the slice of bread, lay it flat in the toaster oven, and there is no dripping problem.  You can't do that with this very substantially priced toaster.Does it work?  Yes.  Is it worth spending this much money on?  Probably not for most people, unless they just happen to like to eat a lot of the narrow range of types of sandwiches suitable for this device.  (And frankly, I don't see the justification for the retail price - it's not like there is anything significantly sophisticated in it electronically.Other reviews are pointing out some good practical uses - and there appear to be many.

"I simply cannot give it five stars due to cost vs. the very small amount that it filters out.  But compared to any of the other alternatives, it's less expensive and much better quality.  I tried not one, but two ""Great Value"" filters from Wallyworld locally - neither worked at all.  I went to Home Depot and looked to see what they had - $50 for a 6 month filter?  Not a chance.  When I compare what is filtered out by Black Berkey water filters that last 6000 gallons per pair, vs. the tiny amount this filters out for only 6 months, there's no comparison.  I wish Berkey made this type of filter, but alas....  Still, 6000 gallons is a huge amount of water (far more than 6 months), and the list of chemicals plus biological items that they filter out for that long is amazing.  They're about the same cost as three of these (just 18 months worth), and these filter a tiny number of chemicals to a relatively minor degree.  We're basically paying for better tasting water, with little additional safety, at a premium price.So why still four stars?  Because I can't find a better filter at a price that equals the price of this filter - they're all outrageously expensive, and lesser quality.

"The birds insisted on a 5-star rating!  What else can I say?  The only reason I rated it as a 4-star rating is the price.  Yes, I got it for evaluation for free through the Amazon Vine program, and would be very tempted to purchase it, except that I looked at the price.  In this 4.5 pound size, the price is outrageous per pound, even without shipping if you've got Amazon Prime.  Yes, the price comes down significantly for the 20 pound size, but then there's another $4.99 shipping (no Prime availability for the larger size).  Now for more specifics of the seed itself.I've been using a very satisfactory product from a large membership warehouse store, and the birds thoroughly appreciated it.  There was some waste, but they just tossed it aside when inadvertently grabbing the little pieces of twigs, etc., out of the feeder.  This product seems to have almost zero waste (other than the natural hulls, of course) - it's all seeds.  And within one day the birds decided they didn't mind something different and had used up more of it in one day than I've almost ever seen eaten on any previous day.  Recently we've noticed additional different (and less common) varieties of birds that we've never seen at our feeder before.  Today, they were back.  Clearly ""everybody"" still likes the new offering.  So, the birds' vote is 5-stars.Since they're eating more, and my income is fixed, I'll happily use this up but probably go back to the large bags at the warehouse store once this is gone.  It's just too expensive.Bottom line:  much better than average bird seed.  If you can justify the cost in your budget, go for it.  I won't downgrade it simply because of our own budget, since it is higher quality than what we've been using (which - fortunately - is quite satisfactory).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0PWYVGZLCT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQRGQY#wasThisHelpful","R1I0PWYVGZLCT3","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fortunately it hasn't had to be used ""hot,"" so this review is only having held the primary unit and used the practice canister.  I can see a problem if a larger hand used this, as some others have pointed out, but my wife's hand is relatively small and she merely uses a 3-finger group, not all four, and the stream clears her hand.  However, it's close.  But as my grandfather said, ""A miss is as good as a mile.""  There are no grips on the practice canister, but the grips on the black ""real thing"" naturally tend to bring the three largest fingers onto the housing, with the little finger curling under the bottom.The stream was forceful enough to easily reach out 10 feet and do its job without significant drop in the stream.  And it's probable that any ""miss"" could be corrected almost instantly before an attacker got to the user unless that attacker was sprinting and the user didn't notice it until the closing distance was too little to allow decent reaction.My wife attached it to her keyring and immediately said, ""Oh, I could just carry my keys out to my car like this,"" as she gripped the Sabre case, ready for use.  The ""safety"" was easy to operate, and worked exactly the same on the real unit as on the practice canister.The only thing standing in the way of a 5-star rating is the very real possibility of gripping the case a bit too high and getting spray-back or blocking the spray altogether.  While unlikely, practicing in the back yard is not the same as a real emergency.  Also, we have no way of knowing just how effective the spray itself is (no, I wasn't willing to be the test subject LOL).  Overall, looks like a VERY good product.  Yes, I'm a Vine reviewer and therefore got the product to evaluate without cost.  But one of my criteria in reviews is whether I would pay the retail price to actually purchase this myself.  $10-15?  Absolutely, particularly when it comes to my wife's safety.  This is close to a 5-star product (something I ONLY give to what I consider to be in the ""best of the best"" category).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R345940JR58T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058ENC7G#wasThisHelpful","R3R345940JR58T","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, it appears to be a reasonably good product.  I will come back at a later time and update it one way or the other, as needed, to report how it performs longer term.  I got the product for use on an outdoor plastic shed that gets mildew easily.  I cleaned the shed first using bleach, allowed it to dry, then applied the 303 product as instructed on the instructions.  However, be aware that the warning about too much of it can drip and run, and that it needs to be wiped and dried immediately, is entirely a non-issue.  There is a 2nd set of instructions that just continues from the first set, pertaining to either a spray or liquid application (can't tell which, but clearly they switched to liquid application, not the moist towelettes).  It says that excess product might be a problem with liquid, therefore it has to be wiped and dried immediately.  The moist towelettes in this container could hardly be accused of being too saturated.  If anything, I was a bit unimpressed with the limited amount of product actually in each towelette.  I actually ended up using four different towelettes for the first section I did  as a test (something less than two square feet).  At that rate, the product is not going to last long at all, making it a very UNeconomical product to use for something as relatively non-critical as an outdoor shed.  There are only 40 towelettes measuring 7""x8"" in the container.  I expect that once I get done with the entire shed, I'll have used a minimum of half the container (probably nearly all of it).  I'm not convinced that I'd want to spend either the Amazon price or the listed retail price just to keep an outdoor shed mildew free for just a few months.  A little bleach will take care of the same problem a whole lot cheaper.IF this really keeps the mildew away for considerably longer, it might be worth it.  And I plan to update this review as needed, since I only did a section to start with (bleached twice as much as I intended to use this product on, to compare return of the mildew on the untreated but bleached portion, vs. the treated portion).  For now, it's just a so-so product, with instructions that were apparently applicable to two different forms of the product.  I was not encouraged when the product itself recommended re-use in just a few months.As for the cancer-causing chemicals some reviewers are all upset about, I'd just ask if they've ever read any OTHER labels for products sold in California.  You need a permit to blow your nose in California, and then have to call the HAZMAT team to come safely dispose of your tissue and supervise the proper washing of your hands and disinfection of your home.  And they'll send you a bill for their services.  (Only a slight exaggeration.)  Those warning labels may have some validity, but California is way overboard with them compared to any other state.  As with any chemical, use good sense.  I simply used disposable nitrile gloves for the job - protected me from the bleach as well as the ""horrible cancer causing chemicals"" in this product.

"We've had these right at 3 years, they've held up very well (only two sets rotated between washings), and to quote my wife, she'd only replace them if she ""could get 1200 thread count silk, or something like that.""  The price is high, but they're very well constructed (thus infrequent replacement), soft, and very, very comfortable.  They may or may not lower the temperature, but they're certainly at least as comfortable in terms of temperature in both winter and summer.  $219 is a real stretch for our budget, but they're lasting at least as well as other very good sheets we've had in the past, and sleeping comfort is outstanding.

"I'm surprised, but this is a really nice product.  I did not expect a 1-ply toilet paper to be either strong or soft.  While it's not quite as soft as one of the other Charmin products, that's purely a matter of preference.  I slightly prefer one of the other Charmin products, personally, but when I use this I'm fully satisfied.  I give few 5-star ratings, but this gets one because it's quite acceptable to me as a very close 2nd choice, and it is my wife's solid first choice.  She had no problem with the other product, but once she tried this one, she insisted we keep it in one of our two bathrooms - which she now uses almost exclusively because of this toilet paper.  Frankly, I never thought I'd be writing a glowing review of toilet paper, of all products, but this is really good.  We're finding we're using less of it than we use of the Charmin ""Ultra Strong"" (my preference, but only very slightly).  If we had to choose one over the other, I'd be satisfied with this one, but my wife would be insistent on this one.  And I have to agree - despite being ALMOST as soft as the ""Ultra Strong,"" it doesn't shred any more than the ""Ultra Strong"" (and FAR less than their specialty ""Soft"" version - which I can't stand).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLNLILM0EHRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOSANPM#wasThisHelpful","RDLNLILM0EHRN","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Simple idea that makes jobs easier and less messy.UPDATE: Just purchased replacement pads for this a couple of weeks ago.

"Raw, unsweetened, non-GMO, and organic.  That automatically puts this product above so many others, and almost qualifies it for a 5-star rating by itself.  But it would have gotten a strong 4-star rating except for one thing.  My wife is the cacao nibs fan, not me, yet both of use combined got to the 5-star level in our assessment of the product.  She thought it tasted better than a previous brand we got several months ago - and I thought at this level, this type of product would be ""you've tasted one, you've tasted them all.""  So, despite really not liking raw cacao nibs, I tried some just to see.  And no, I did not like them.  BUT, they seemed less ""bitingly bitter"" as I've always experienced this type of product to be, and there was very little unpleasant lingering after-taste I normally experience with it.  In fact, I did not have to go find something else to eat to mask the taste - I just let it dwindle and go away on its own, and wasn't particularly bothered by it.  Despite not personally liking it, that's a big plus for me.  So on top of my wife's assessment that it tasted somehow better than the last brand she tried (a good one), and my finding it quite a bit less distasteful, ironically that puts it up to a full 5-star rating for us - a relative rarity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6JAN21QTMJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW81YM#wasThisHelpful","R2L6JAN21QTMJB","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I am very reluctant to give any product or book a 5-star review.  I have worked in positions where the performance evaluation systems have gotten so inflated that it was almost impossible to tell the difference between the 80% of employees that got top-block ratings - at least by looking at their evaluations. Some of those systems were eventually replaced by methods where only a certain percentage could get top-block ratings, only another percentage could get the next level down, etc.  THEN it began to truly reward those that were among the very best employees.  I look at the Amazon review system as being quite similar.With that said, there was no question, before I even finished this book, that it would come out as a 5-star review.  It is simply among the very best of its kind.  But let me back up.As Vine reviewers, we have a period of time in which we MUST review a product, or be temporarily cut off from the program.  The amount of time is adequate for most types of products, including books, but it requires (for a fair review anyway) that the book actually BE read - fully.  I sometimes look at other reviews first, just to see if I'm ""seeing"" things accurately or not, but rarely look at reviews before even reading a book.  For some reason, I did so in this case, and was disappointed at what I was seeing in some of the lowest rated reviews.  I actually went into the book expecting something quite self-serving, even perhaps exhibitionist in a way.  I ended the book this evening with quite a different feeling, to say the least.  Is Tommy Rosen expressive?  Most definitely.  Does he push the limits of language at times?  Most certainly.  But if one is about to read a book about recovery from addiction, and is not prepared to hear language that is at times offensive to some, that person knows very little about the world of addiction and I would wonder why they're even reading it.  Harsh?  No, reality.Do I use some of the language the author occasionally throws in?  Not in the past 39 years - but that's just me, and my personal choice.  One of the tenets of recovery is often expressed as, ""Live and let live.""  This book isn't about his personal habits as some criticized, nor his language.  It is about his insight - and that is rare indeed.I am more than well acquainted with the 12 Steps.  I am more than aware of the relatively low rate of recovery associated with them.  Does that bother me?  Very much so - but not because of the program.  It's because of the intensely sad fact that most people do not truly understand what the 12-step programs are trying to teach, and most have probably never even seen the Big Book except across a room when someone sharing in a meeting happens to hold one up as s/he refers to it in some way.  The 12 Steps are one of the most inspired sets of teachings, or even life-instructions, in existence.  Dr. Bob and Bill W. understood things they tried to put into words, but like any other human being, were not entirely able to do so in a way that would resonate with everyone.  That's just the way we humans are.  But it doesn't change the power and depth of the 12 Steps.  Rosen clearly and fully recognizes that, however, and does a masterful job of explaining the 12 steps in a different way than the Big Book does, for example, and he will therefore reach some that weren't reached before.But he goes beyond the 12 Steps.  DO NOT read an implication there that he pushes them back into some 2nd-rate position while still paying lip service to them - not at all.  They are still the core.  And thus he came up with the title of the book: ""Recovery 2.0.""  It is built ON Recovery 1.0 (the 12 Steps), not a replacement FOR Recovery 1.0.  If you look at the code for any version of a major computer operating system, they all build on the original code for the first version of the system.  Take away all the original code, and it doesn't work.  But build in the enhancements, and it works together in a way that equates to 1+1=3, or 4, or 5.  That is what Rosen does when he adds in v2.0 of Recovery.  Don't like Yoga?  Tough.  Read all the way through it and understand WHY it worked for Rosen.  If you want to use something else like Tai Chi or Qi Gong?  Fine - as long as you get the same things out of it that Rosen describes as HIS benefits FROM yoga.  Yoga isn't the magic.  Just like the 12 Steps, you can ""do"" Yoga and still not get much out of it.Diet?  Don't like Rosen's 30-day cleanse?  Fine.  Just find something else that works as well.  He even says as much, as he talks about all the different diets out there.The point?  It's not about the 12 Steps, or Yoga, or diet.  It's about the mental transformation that comes with the combination of all of that - and more.  If you TRULY want recovery (not just abstinence), this is, in my opinion, one of THE very best approaches I've ever seen.  And I'll stack up both personal and professional experience behind that assessment, not just some amateur observations from the result of a chocolate addiction and/or taking a psychology class once that had an emphasis on addiction.  Rosen understand the 12 steps in a way few do, unfortunately, and he is intelligent enough to have learned from others how to move even further than is generally possible with the 12 Steps along (again, not in ANY way diminishing them - they are, after all, the core ""code"" in the program).This is a study-and-contemplate book, not a straight read-through book.  Don't like some of his examples?  No problem.  They're not the point anyway.  Ask yourself, ""Was he learning about himself and his recovery FROM his examples, and how can that apply to ME, in MY situations, with my examples?""  I'm just glad I took the entire time, to the end of the last day, before I decided to write this review.  It allowed me to more fully appreciate what's in it.  Sincere thank you, Tommy Rosen.  Despite 39 years in recovery, I now see that the remaining years until that ""exhale"" are going to be even better.  (You have to really read the book - all the way - to ""get"" that.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H091GR0B8IAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944485#wasThisHelpful","R3H091GR0B8IAR","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Electronically, this seems to be a very big improvement over our previous router.  Speed is noticeably faster.  BUT - the documentation that comes with it on paper is next to useless.  It omits some key, essential information.  I'm nowhere near a network expert, but fortunately knew there had to be some kind of security involved.  Yet nothing in the printed instructions even hints at security.  It appears that once you've completed the instructions, you're done.  And even the printed instructions were insufficient.  If you don't know whether you've got a static or dynamic IP address, the instructions just tell you to use the auto-detect function.  I just happened to use the auto-detect function.  The problem is, it ""detected"" a static IP address for my computer, then asked me to fill in the various fields on the next screen with the IP address, etc.  Ooops!  First, how would I know that?  I wasn't even connected to the internet yet, and set-up wasn't complete.  I happen to know how to use the Windows command prompt to determine IP address, etc., but how many computer users have no clue how to do that?  It would have driven them nuts!  I also happen to know I've got a dynamic IP address, so I went back and changed to ""dynamic,"" and was able to proceed.  What would another user have done if they'd been trying to set up ONLY wireless connections with laptops, for example?  They could not have gotten on line to search the web site (virtually useless anyway).Fortunately, my desktop computer is wired to the router, so I was able to get on line quickly.  But then our laptops weren't able to connect.  Reason?  A different configuration (unspecified by the router screens) existed since our previous router (I used the same name and password).  I finally figured out it was a mismatch on security settings - but which one(s)?  Nowhere on the box, and actually not even anywhere that I could find on the company web site, did it show what settings to use (WPA2 and AES are the pre-set defaults for anyone stuck there).  And at the time I was trying to set it up, all I could find was email technical support with a promise of a response within 2 days.  That's totally unacceptable.  Only later did I find a tech support number, but I'd already sent the email and will just wait for an answer.  The web site and documentation are not at all user-friendly.I finally popped in the documentation disc that comes with it and found that they recommend the above settings for security (our previous router used TPIK - thus the mismatch).  And once I corrected the settings in the laptops, we were on - with excellent speed (apparently far better than our old router).  Signal strength in our house is about the same as our old router (pretty good), if not just a bit better.  Interestingly, my smart phone showed a considerably stronger 2.4GHz signal than the 5GHz signal, though the 5GHz signal was still good at the other end of the house through multiple walls.  (The laptops don't ""see"" the 5GHz signal.)The CD documentation is NOT user friendly for a novice.  I pity someone that has no clue how to set up a router.  It would be virtually impossible for such a person to ever get this thing working.  So, I give it a 5-star rating on operation, and a 1-star rating for the necessary documentation to set it up, averaging out to a 3-star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6BFPEUFDAD7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDLRHFW#wasThisHelpful","R6BFPEUFDAD7B","A26X7W5UM5QFT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26X7W5UM5QFT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked the first movie the Hunger Games and liked similar type movies better so had mixed feeling about seeing the sequel.I loved Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods out at the same time. A group of young people in a remote cabin on a weekend are unaware that they are on a reality show and are slowly being killed off in creative and horrifying ways for ratings. The theme is a little similar, and it's a brilliant movie inspired by Sam Raimi's horror classic The Evil Dead.Hunger Games put me in mind of Oliver Stone's movie Natural Born Killers, a keen satire on consumerism and how death somehow becomes entertainment, and villains become icons, a great movie which coincidentally stars Woody Harrelson.Upon the good word of friends and good reviews I decided to go see Catching Fire, and loved it more than the original and I will definitely go see the next one.For one thing, the sequel moves from being a simple action movie, to developing the characters and giving them soul. Katniss is told she will never have to fight again, yet despite the ratings success of the Hunger Games throughout the districts natives are getting restless, and now surviving tributes admired by the public for their fighting skills are viewed by President Snow as a threat which does not bode well for our heroine.  The promoters have to find ways of getting higher ratings while keeping the restive natives from rebelling.As our tributes become heroes they also become icons the people can rally around, yet they are paraded to maintain the status quo. How does a dictator President Snow maintain control, when our heroes are perceived as threats.I loved how this sequel blossomed from a routine adventure movie into more three dimensional characters. I found this added to my entertainment experience.  For one thing there is a deeper relationship between Katniss and Peeta and other characters.We have the romantic triangle with Katniss' two potential suitors, Peeta with whom she agrees to maintain the pretense of love for the cameras, and the Liam Hemsworth character with whom she seems close but can it go the distance.  Can adventure and excitement, and life and death situations ignite the real thing?  Will feigned love blossom into the real thing with her renewed proximity to Peeta, and what new adventures are in store?I am very delighted with how the story developed, managing to surprise me with its twists and turns departing considerably from my modest expectations in engaging ways.I admired what J Law brings to the part of Katniss.  It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job.As she is paraded in a chariot I  could as easily imagine her playing an iconic role like Cleopatra or Helen of Troy, she has that kind of presence.  She adds a noticeable dimension to this movie, elevating it beyond what it would otherwise be.But not all credit belongs to the actress. Simon Beaufoy creates an excellent screenplay, having previously won the Academy Award for Best Adapted screenplay for Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Francis Lawrence has previously directed other excellent movies such as I am Legend and Water for Elephants. Both deserve kudos for what they have done here.I think most people will love it, and probably more than the first movie, because in my opinion at least it is considerably better, and I hope this was helpful.  I have high hopes that the third one will be even better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1GCX93IACAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUS8M#wasThisHelpful","R3H1GCX93IACAO","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Say what you will about Delivery Man one thing it has going for it is an original premise.

Meanwhile he has debts, and commitment issues with a girlfriend.I went to this movie expecting to see a regular movie, with punch lines and much laughter, the kind of comedy one often goes to see, full of laughs yet instantly forgettable. What I did not expect was a sentimental and somewhat touching movie. I doubt if the Vince Vaughn of 10 years ago could have pulled off this role in quite this way. Yet at times this movie transcends comedy and becomes touching without ever becoming maudlin.To tell you too much about it would be to render an injustice to the spontaneity of your experience. I found it a worthwhile, and enjoyable experience, and am glad I saw it, and I think most people will feel the same way, and it is an original premise, in a world where recycled premises are beaten to death through overuse, and if you're like me you long for something you have not seen before. Glad to see a comedy that breaks with convention.I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GBK69WG0U0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEKNTQW#wasThisHelpful","R13GBK69WG0U0B","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1985. A sexually active, straight, carousing, drug abusing Texas rodeo cowboy collapses. At the hospital he is told he has HIV and has less than thirty days to live. Does he succumb to the diagnosis, or does something else happen entirely?Dallas Buyers Club is based on a true story about Ron Woodruff. I must admit I was unfamiliar with this movie. The ticket seller gave me an unconvincing outline, and I was about to walk away when a couple overhearing our conversation assured me it was a good movie.I am glad to say they were correct. This is the exact type of movie that wins Oscars, and gets many nominations.Matthew Mc Conaughey deserves to be nominated for playing someone battling a deadly disease who takes on big drugs and the FDA, to enable other sufferers like himself to have access to supplements and life saving drugs. He reputedly lost about 40 pounds for the role, and at times does look very gaunt, which gives an added layer of reality to his portrayal.This is a multi faceted movie full of interesting characters, which operates on multiple levels at once. The personal struggle, the parallel struggles and contrasts, and the battle against different facets of authority. Jennifer Garner in a supporting role plays a feisty yet compassionate doctor, while a colleague with more of an eye to profit becomes a doctor shill for big drugs, which are experimental, still unproven, and in the clinical trial stage, and may have toxic side effects, while our protagonist has to chase down a caring and competent doctor in Mexico who was disbarred, for less toxic alternatives.Why does one experimental method, with an unproven drug, take priority over drugs that are unapproved by the FDA? Aren't drugs undergoing clinical trials also unapproved? In both cases aren't people offering themselves as guinea pigs, and why shouldn't they be allowed to do that? After all, it is their lives.I loved this movie, and I found the story far more engaging than I thought I would beforehand. I was particularly intrigued and a little surprised by how hard hitting it was against the FDA, and the role it plays in connection with the big pharmaceutical companies, and how it restricts our access even to harmless supplements.I love it when a character is resourceful, so I loved the answers he gives an FDA official when he is stopped and questioned at the border.As often happens in a movie of this nature, there is more than one great performance. An unrecognizable Jared Leto gives a breathtaking performance as a gaunt transgender woman also undergoing treatment who Ron meets, and who sources customers for him. Ray like others has to deal with Ron's homophobia, and it's refreshing to see how it plays out as the character develops. What I love is the journey the character makes through being confronted with his own mortality, and how that affects a wider circle of people.If Leto does not get an Oscar nomination for his role then there is no justice in Hollywood. He would have to be a leading contender for Best Supporting Actor, as Matthew McConaughey would be for Best Actor.One thing that has impressed me in recent years is McConaughey's transition from lightweight romcom, and pretty boy roles, to more challenging roles. For instance, I consider Lincoln Lawyer to be one of his best roles as a wheeler dealer lawyer but not the type of role for which an actor is typically nominated. He battles the system but has no weakness.Actors win Oscars for playing two types of roles:One is the psychopath, such as Daniel Day Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.The second is actors battling disabilities or diseases and/or social injustice. Recently Octavia Spenser won for playing a maid dealing with racial discrimination, Meryl Streep for playing a Prime Minister battling alzheimers, and Christian Bale for playing a former boxer battling drug addiction. Jennifer Lawrence won playing a character battling grief who acts out sexually. Bradley Cooper was nominated for playing someone with bipolar disorder in the same movie. Jeff Bridges won an alcoholic country singer. More recently the trend has been moving toward playing real life characters.As often happens the best movies of the year are released in December and timed for an Oscar run. I think most people will love it","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LKJ2N1RVBCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUO3C3W#wasThisHelpful","R37LKJ2N1RVBCT","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if you're like me, but I have three desires. One, the protection of my data. Two, portability. Three, a smaller laptop type device with all the capabilities of a typical laptop.My previous computer crashed due to a defective hard drive, and I found myself taking the longest time before buying the Chromebook. I also wanted something better than a typical tablet. Make no mistake this is a tablet on steroids. It is not a pc, but it is close offering most of benefits of a pc, and in some respects offers considerable advatages.I bought it at a well known national retailer for about the same price as Amazon. What made me decide to buy this computer was the excellent advice given by someone from google who worked at the store.May I say that in terms of sophistication and ease of use it far exceeds a tablet device. I own a Nook, but I would not use it for buying an airline ticket, for example.The following made me decide to buy:100 gb of free storage for two years, offering considerable saving on online storage.Able after easy setup to walk out of the store with it working.The possibility of google cloud printing.The fact that you press a button and it's on, like a calculator.It updates automatically.It has in built antivirus protection, so you do not have to purchase software.You have the full benefit of the google technology, including drive.You have a wide range of apps available, particularly for document production, and its compatible with MS Office, and ODT.It also has pdf apps that are excellent, and you can easily convert a document into a pdf for easy printing..Other factors I liked after purchasing.It's light, compact, and easy to carry.It's very quick at connecting to new networks if you're roaming.It has great battery life about 6.5 hours, and this can vary depending on the nature of your usage.It even has an indicator which tells how much battery life is left.Google Drive offers you the opportunity to sign in and access your documents from anywhere.You can also create documents from anywhere, and even share documents online and allow other people to edit your document.Comparison to full pc laptop. For an extra $50 you can buy a laptop.On this computer you can do most but not all of what you can do on a regular computer. This is an absolutely excellent internet computing device. It's quick, and can process a lot of content, and you can have multiple windows open simultaneously without any noticeable slowdown. Unlike a regular PC it will never slow down.Automatic updates mean you never have to shut down it down like a regular pc to make updates.It does not have a cd player, so if cd burning is important, this is not for you. You can listen to your music collection on google cloud. I can easily listen to my amazon cloud music for example.It works with apps not with software. There are plenty of applications you can get at the google store many for free.I found that I cannot use Snagit on this computer to capture content. I use my pc for that.I love streaming movies on this machine. The pictures are crisp and vibrant, the sound excellent.I could watch a movie in bed without any of the awkward balancing you might have with a regular pc.Around the same time I bought this I also got a regular Dell PC. By comparison this is way faster to get going on. The Windows 8 apps on my new PC I found very annoying. They do not seem to work very well, and it's like running an obstacle course to get to a regular desktop setting.Although the google cloud printing was a major selling point, I went to another national retailer and bought an Epson 3520, which the salesperson assured me was cloud compatible. It's the most up to date. But when I attempted to integrate it with this machine it was not cloud compatible. So, if you do go for a cloud ready printer, research the makes and models before you go to the store, as salespeople do not always know.I like to Skype, so that was one of the considerations of getting the Chromebook which does not have skype. It does have calling and video calling capabilities called google talk, which I assume are comparable to skype.ExperienceI find that I love the Chromebook, and I tend to use it more than my two regular laptops, which I would be reluctant to take anywhere when I have this more compact, lightweight portable alternative. This is the number one seller in it's category on Amazon, and Samsung makes an excellent machine.As it's a Linux based operating system you will become acquainted with the Google Chrome browsing instead of window. The google drive you can access anywhere even from a different computer, and access your original bookmarks. I bookmark many sites, and I found the bookmarking somewhat preferable on the windows explorer browser.One of the ideas I love is the online storage, which means I could be in a different country yet still able to access 100 gb of content online, which offers considerable advantages over a tablet.I find this to be great hybrid between the tablet and laptop, and I highly recommend it.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT6HEINYM1FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LL9VDG#wasThisHelpful","RT6HEINYM1FS","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit I awaited the publishing of this book with some anticipation, hoping that it might go into some detail on the whole 'Hand D' issue which some Shakespeare scholars consider to be Shakespeare's handwriting.  How they can make such an evaluation is open to question, as the only sample to which to compare this handwritten manuscript is six poorly formed and inconsistent signatures.Recently, a scholar named Bruster from the University of Texas accepted this doubtful attribution as fact, and studied spelling variants to claim that Shakespeare wrote the additions to Spanish Tragedy.  If one attempts to make a case based on spelling variants based on a dubious attribution one is on doubly shaky ground.  He des this in hope that two conjectures might equal a fact. However, he fails to acknowledge the evidence and the fact that  according to Henslowe's Diary Ben Jonson was paid for making the same additions shortly before the play was republished with those additions in 1602.I also hoped that it would show the handwriting and photograph excerpts in sufficiently detailed form so that one could make one's own evaluation.  Although the scholarship is quite engaging, the photograph excerpts are not sufficient for one to do one's own evaluation if one wishes, in my opinion.  Another thing is that the presentation is choppy with some many footnotes on single pages, that there may be only several lines of dialogue on a single page.  I found this quite disruptive to the continuity of reading, compared to say reading it on Kindle where one can look up individual words or meanings as one goes along.Sir Thomas More lay unpublished as a manuscript for about two hundred years, then receiving a publication as Shakespeare in book form.  The play was a collaboration between several authors, and several portions of it were subjected to censorship.  The play does have some points of interest particularly in dealing with this Catholic martyr who lived and died under King Henry VIII's reign.For instance as a study in pathos, it's absolutely excellent with fascinating dialogue for example between More and his executioner, who admires him, and so is reluctant, and an earlier scene which I am sure would hold an audience spellbound shows a group in the process of being executed when a pardon arrives for all.A critique of this play is that the cast is too large making it unwieldy for the economics of regular production.All in all, I do recommend this play, there are cheaper and what you may find to be better alternatives.  In my travels I found a rather interesting version online which I could read and enjoy without all the choppiness of showing the different hands, which probably would have been better shown in the appendix.I leave it to your tender discretion, and highly recommend the play, although I would recommend reading another version first, before investing in this particular version.  The Oxford Edition shows passages thought to be Shakespeare which runs to about two pages in that edition, and only about four pages if you reading in a regular format.I think most people will enjoy the play, and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38XGGVWTO5RWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1904271480#wasThisHelpful","R38XGGVWTO5RWQ","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I am not always a fan of watching stage plays recorded on film, much preferring to see the movie like setting varying between real locations, although neither I think is a match for actually being there to watch a stage performance.In the 1960s  Marlowe's  Doctor Faustus was made into a movie starring Richard Burton as Faustus, and Elizabeth Taylor makes a brief appearance as Helen of Troy.While that movie had its good points, and its star power, I particularly loved the note of pathos in Mephistopheles voice, showing that this was a nuanced portrayal as opposed to a stock character.What becomes apparent as you begin to watch The Globe's production of that classic by Christopher Marlowe is that this though this is a staged play it captures every nuance I think of what Marlowe intended, and perhaps a few he did not, and I mean that in a good way because it's all good.  In fact, if you ever wanted to see Faustus, I would highly recommend you get this version over any other.I particularly liked the comedic scenes, where one of the lesser character was accidentally using the magic book to make incantations, and what happens.  Then there is the beautiful and elegant expression of Marlowe.  There is the atmosphere created by the actors, and the response of the crowd particularly gives the play added dimension over staged plays which are filmed without audience participation.One also understands that the play is being performed in the medium in which it was originally written, so it would not be that difficult to go backwards in time and imagine what it would be like to be in an Elizabethan or Restoration period audience, probably loud sweaty and uncivilized, a raucous crowd that react to scenes where Faustus performs magic on the Pope.When one thinks about this particular era, although one tends to think of the Shakespeare plays as emblems of excellence, there were many great writers in that era who did create great works but who have been largely overlooked, and none were greater than Marlowe whose lines echo within the Shakespeare canon.""Mingled with coral and with orient pearl.""  Tamburlaine""I'll have them fly to India for gold,Ransack the ocean for orient pearl ""  Doctor Faustus""Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.""  Jew of Malta""This orient pearl.

Good luck.Complications, and numerous adventures occur, and is the stripper hard hearted, or does she have a heart of gold?What impressed me most in watching this movie was Sudeikis' vast improvement and his presence and charisma in the movie.In previous movies he has been the also ran among greater stars, but here he occasionally displays a charisma reminiscent of George Clooney in his comedy roles, and I think this movie will prove to be a major breakthrough role for him, and put him on the map as a leading actor.Jennifer Aniston displays her usual comedy skills, and there are a couple of raunchy stripper scenes which display her physique very well.  Emma Roberts,  Julia Roberts niece, shows that that she is a creditable actress in her own right.

"Before buying this my familiarity with John Donne extended to his famous Sonnet X, Death Be Not Proud.In the Delphi edition, we have quite an extensive array of poetry, prose, meditations and three separate biographies contained within.  I own a number of Delphi editions and find them to be quite thorough, perhaps the most thorough offering you will get on a particular writer or poet.Sometimes, though an edition professes to be complete, I often find there is a missing piece, and when this is pointed out Delphi are quite good at doing updates.In this case, the Shakespeare epitaph poem from his 1633 collection, which is surprisingly similar to the William Basse poem in Shakespeare's First Folio is omitted.  Likewise Death's Duel, Donne's final sermon though referred to is not included.Contents include a very interesting piece based on Ovid's Flea, and Meditation XVII which influenced Hemingway's famous line 'For Whom The Bell Tolls.'  Donne's sonnets and poems range rather surprisingly from the profoundly spiritual to the bawdy, and the quality of poems and expression is surprisingly good.  Some of the Sonnets I find to be on a par with the Shakespeare Sonnets, and contain intriguing conceits and extremely well constructed conceits, with titles such as'Spit in my face you Jews, and pierce my side,' which is quite a bold and possibly controversial way to start a poem.  Another one starts: 'At the round earth's imagined corners blow.'  One of my favorites is 'Negative Love.'According to Ben Jonson who was not prone to giving compliments, he considered Donne first in the world for some things.For what is contained here and for the price this is quite an impressive collection.All in all, if you like poetry, I see no reason why you would not love this collection.  I think  you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUUDZ32C81KJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009BEE8CC#wasThisHelpful","RUUDZ32C81KJ1","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know where you are on the whole Shakespeare authorship question, but in 1955 after about 19 years of study Calvin Hoffman Hoffman published this book, which explores the idea that playwright Christopher Marlowe did not die in 1593 as reported but lived and continued to write plays under the pseudonym of Shakespeare.  Shakespeare first emerges as a writer within days of Marlowe's death with a poem called Venus and Adonis, a poem that refers to the poem Hero and Leander by Marlowe which would not appear for another five years.How could a new author's poem contain parallels  to an unpublished poem, and how could the yet to be published piece also contain links  and common references to this new poem.  Many scholars through the centuries have commented on the influence of Marlowe upon Shakespeare, and some Shakespeare scholars have even claimed that some Shakespeare plays were written by Marlowe.Edmond Malone, an early Shakespeare editor assigned Titus Andronicus to Marlowe, and he and others such as Tucker Brooke attributed the Henry VI plays to Marlowe.How important is this book?  Well it is the cornerstone upon which Marlovian theory is built.  He is not the first person to propose this theory and certainly not the last, but this book is probably the leading book which has converted people to the Marlovian camp, and you will find information in here that you will not find in orthodox Shakespeare books.He posts over 200 parallel quotes that run between Marlowe and Shakespeare plays.  Some of the themes Hoffman writes about have been developed since then.  What I found intriguing was his work on as You Like It, and his exploration of all the Anonymous plays that were issued during Shakespeare's lifetime.  Only 17 of the 36 plays which appeared in the 1623 First Folio were published during Shakespeare's lifetime, and eight of these were first published anonymously.One point of interest is that the name Shakespeare appears on several plays that have been discounted as being Shakespeare such as London Prodigal, and Yorkshire Tragedy.  Shakespeare's name was removed as author of Passionate Pilgrim  in 1612 after a complaint by Thomas Heywood to the printer about making so bold with his name.  The 1609 Sonnets were considered to be unauthorized, and there is a False Folio of 10 Shakespeare plays published in 1619 three years after Shakespeare's death where quartos are backdated, and the name Shakespeare added to previously unattributed plays.  The name Shakespeare has been discounted as the author of Sir John Old-Castle, and The First and Second Parts of the Contention.  In addition two versions of The Troublesome Raigne of King John 1611 by W. Sh, and 1622 by William Shakespeare have also been declared forgeries.  The heavily revised King John appears in the First Folio a year later.Shakespeare's name does not appear on any play until 1598, five years after Marlowe's death, which means that every quote in Shakespeare which parallels that in a Marlowe was first made by Marlowe.Certainly, if one is going to explore Marlovian theory then this is a must read book.  I would also recommend the documentary Much Ado About Something which led me to this book.I think most people will find the story of Marlowe quite engrossing, as he is a very interesting character.  Recently a movie was released by Jim Jarmusch called Only Lovers Left Alive, in which John Hurt plays a vampire named Christopher Marlowe.Approximately 80 people have been proposed as the author of Shakespeare, the leading candidate currently being Edward DeVere the Earl of Oxford.Did Marlowe fake his death?  He was arrested ten days before his death, and was likely to be charged with both heresy and atheism if he lived, and at least two people who were at the murder in Deptford were spies, and Marlowe had intelligence connections particularly to Thomas Walsingham and Lord Burghley, so it would appear that we do have the circumstances under which a person might fake their death, and the resources to do so, and being a writer then be free to continue to write under an assumed name.Hoffman's book is by means without flaws, the lack of an index being one, and the assertion that Marlowe had a homosexual relationship with Thomas Walsingham has no supporting evidence whatsoever, yet he claims they had such a relationship while Marlowe was still in University, again without any evidence.  Many authors of Marlowe though have treated Hoffman's speculations as fact.If the subject of Shakespeare authorship interests you, this is highly recommended.  If you are a true believer that Shakespeare was an author, you might want to give this one a miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ8YVDENDXBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006AU5OU#wasThisHelpful","R1YZ8YVDENDXBW","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have many books on energy. Yet there is nothing quite like seeing the various energy techniques demonstrated, most of which are new to me.I know I would not be doing these exercises properly if I did not see it demonstrated on the DVD. The method used here is a combination of acupressure tapping, and kinesiology method of energy testing to spot energy weaknesses. She also demonstrates the Wayne Cook posture for balancing energy. I found the Heaven rushing in exercise particularly good.I was particularly interested to learn that there are pressure points for fight of flight response (also the freeze response), which I now use for staying clear.In this package is a guidebook with her biography, case studies and an explanation with diagrams of the body's energy systems and a deck of easy to follow flashcards.There is also a cut glass crystal, with a string for spinning the crystal,which can act like a pendulum. The crystal can be used for chakra cleansing, and I could certainly feel a shift in energy in the chakras as they reattuned to the higher vibration of the crystal.There is also a cd. This package is a great value.If you are like me, you may be wondering which I should buy first, the Energy Medicine book or this kit.This EM kit stands by itself, and the multi media format is more user friendly than a book could be.

It's Jin Shin Jitsu, a complete system, very easy to learn and use.The EFT Manual (EFT: Emotional Freedom Techniques)by Gary Craig is a simple tapping process useful for letting go of troubling emotions. Imagine easily letting go of issues such as anger, anxiety, fear, forgiveness, stress, procrastination, traumas. [...], and buy various books on Amazon.The Emotion Code by Bradley Nelson.

"If you're like me you have probably dreamed of meeting the public person who most inspires your life many times. Maybe it will happen for you as it happens for some fans backstage on Part of Me.The next best thing would  be going to the concert and hoping that one day, maybe.. you could be one of the lucky few who make it all the way backstage and meet your inspiration, or would you meet them randomly somewhere? It happens.Here then is a rare opportunity to do something similar, experience Katy Perry in concert, get a backstage pass and a fly on the wall behind the scenes look at the California Dreams tour.I will be the first to admit that I am not Katy Perry's number one fan. I don't own any of her albums, but I do respect her accomplishments, her mighty alabaster orbs, her charisma and presence and the fact that she did manage to get five number ones singles off her Teenage Dreams album.In so doing she matched an accomplishment only ever achieved by Michael Jackson for Bad.Her number one Billboard singles were: Last Friday Night (TGIF), California Gurls (featuring Snoop Dogg), the anthemic Firework, E.T (featuring Kanye West) and Teenage Dream.As a writer I loved her use her use of alliteration on songs such as Hummingbird Heartbeat, and cherry chapstick on I Kissed a Girl.Part of me is combination biography, concert tour, real life drama. I loved watching the performances and I think she is a tremendous songwriter with one of the best voices in the business.The bio part shows that overnight success only came after years of hard work, struggle and rejection. It's an inspiring story about persisting against the odds.Although she was going through some tough personal stuff in her life during this tour particularly with the end of the marriage with Russell Brand I found this gave an emotional wallop to the movie. At one point before the concert in Rio she sobs uncontrollably in her dressing room. Her staff wonders if she can perform at all.Then she calls for her makeup artist. On her way to the stage she breaks down again her body racked with sobs. Then she gets on the elevator to the stage, she turns on her lollipops and we see a change in her facial expression as her game face comes on. It's a wonder to behold. What a trouper.Then the fans sing 'we love you Katy' in Portuguese almost as if they sense her struggle and lift her up. These were some of the greatest moments I will experience at any movie this year. The concert scenes I found to be visually spectacular down to the smallest detail with vibrant colors and a dizzying array of colorful costumes that dutifully and beautifully highlight her voluptuous figure.I commend her for letting us get so close and sharing something so deeply personal even though she was hurting at the time. In so doing she has fashioned a remarkable movie.I loved this movie and highly recommend it even if you are not a huge fan but just love great performance and I hope you found this helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8WLN61X7VBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CPEOC4#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8WLN61X7VBV","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went to see this movie because I wanted to see Whitney Houston's last performance.Sparkle tells the story of three sisters, raised in a nice home by a strict mother, played by Whitney Houston who used to be an alcoholic, but has found the Lord and wants to keep her daughter on the narrow path.As you watch this movie you will begin to notice this strategy has limited success.It's also framed as a cautionary tale about the bumpy road to fame.One daughter is a beautiful talented singer, another Sparkle is a talented songwriter who has always been in the sister's shade but prepared to sacrifice for the good of the group. The other one is simply brainy and attractive.The pitfalls of music and life are explored as the girls form a group and the singer gets into a relationship with a tv comedian and experiences a fall from grace. The movie explores themes of drugs and violence. Will she manage to retieve herself or will tragedy ensue? Rifts occur which threaten the family itself.I found the movie enjoyable. I loved Whitney Houston's singing solo. The quality of songs were pretty good with a mixture of gospel music and 60s motown type pieces.After I saw this movie I watched the original Sparkle with Philip Michael Thomas of Miami Vice, Irene Cara of Fame, and Lonette McKee.I highly recommend you check out the original. If you happen to be an Amazon Prime member as I write you can watch it for free. While the production values of the current movie are better, the original movie definitely has its moments. It features songs by Curtis Mayfield, a funk master, and I loved the singing performances of the girls with their delicate close harmonies. It also has an organised crime element. Events do differ between the two movies.The original is set in Harlem while the remake is set in Detroit. Judging by the reviews the original seems to have achieved a cult classic status with people claiming to have seen it a hundred times. I prefer the original but you may feel differently particularly if you are a Whitney Houston or Jordin Sparks fan. It really is a vehicle for her talent.I think most people will like it and trust this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UC4S4P550I26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y1YKTO#wasThisHelpful","R3UC4S4P550I26","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Martin McDonagh, among the best known Irish directors previously won an Oscar for the short movie Six shooter A Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Films although he is perhaps best known for the acclaimed In Brugesalso starring Colin Farrell, a dark comedy with tragic overtones about two hitmen on the run.I first heard of this movie last year when I saw the movie The Guard directed by his brother Michael John. A trademark of the McDonaghs is dark humor mixed with some irony and perhaps even some philosophy together with some absurdity. As I loved The Guard so much and it has the biggest domestic box office of any Irish movie ever made, I looked forward to this latest movie with more than a little anticipation.If you're like me and like American directors who also write such as Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, or the Coen Brothers with No Country for Old Men, I think you will also like this.Seven Psychopaths centers around an Irish screenwriter nemed Martin played by Colin Farrell planning to write a movie about seven psychopaths. Life begins to imitate art as a similar tableau to the one he writes about starts to unfold in real life.Woody Harrelson plays Sam a local organised crime leader whose dog is kidnapped by Walken and Sam Rockwell's character who happen to be friends of Martin. Sam cares more about dogs than people. The real mixes with the imaginary in very intriguing ways, and kept the movie audience entertained. I particularly liked the scenes with the Vietnamese priest and the hooker, and the Quaker story. There is also a hit man with a white rabbit played by Tom Waits.The revelatory performance in this movie comes from Sam Rockwell when he helps out Martin with the screenplay lending some psychotic absurdity to the scenes although everyone is excellent.What I like is that McDonagh while clearly inspired by Tarantino and Coen imposes his unique style and does not kowtow to Hollywood conventions and delivers a movie that experiments with different styles of humor and yet manages to engross you so much in the moment that you do not attempt to guess the end. If you do you would probably guess wrong.I love how he works the opening scene with two hitmen discussing preparing for a hit and how the scene turns out.While I would not consider this better than say In Bruges there is a certain heaviness in the theme of In Bruges that is not present here and some people may prefer the more light hearted nature of this movie which is a highly welcome and worthy addition to the McDonagh repertoire.I hope the McDonagh brothers will work together as I think they could give the Coen brothers a run for their money.I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF4RCSOV0KFZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007REV4LQ#wasThisHelpful","RF4RCSOV0KFZB","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Miller appears to have it all, great wealth, great family, supportive wife, a pending sale of his business, and a charming if somewhat cloying French mistress.  But disaster can lurk behind the most distinguished facade waiting for its golden opportunity.Major money off the books, an impatient friend come debtor for his sake, an ardent suitor blowing hot and cold, a frustrated mistress, inquiring auditors, a loyal curious daughter played by Brit Marling, a doltish son, an entitled wife played by Susan Sarandon who may be working her own Arbitrage.Anything that can go wrong does go wrong.  The inciting event occurs early when his mistress dies in a Chappaquiddick style accident while he drives becoming the tragic glass through which the movie is imbibed.Miller faces a succession of moral dilemmas.  The choices being black and white he somehow selects the moral grey.  You may wonder what you would do in his situation.  If you're like me you suspect he might do the right thing under different circumstances.The person who rescues him from this situation becomes the lever police use to get at Miller.  Interestingly, the detective does not pursue people of wealth directly, but puts the poor weak link to the most difficult test  manipulating the system against him.Susan Sarandon looked spectacular in this movie I thought and performed excellently and effortleslly in her scenes.  I have preferred Brit Marling's performances in her Indie movies such as Another Earth and Sound of my Voice.The golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules.Does Miller learn from his experiences?  Sometimes when a movie does not give you the type of closure you want, it's actually a good thing because it reminds us of how things really are.I think this is one of the best performances of Gere's career.  It achieved a modest $2 million on its opening weekend on a very limited release in 197 theaters yet managed an impressive $10,000 per theater.  Why it was opened in such a limited way is somewhat of a puzzle as it's quite a good movie.I think most people will love it and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQTGX3628IRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AP3HQK#wasThisHelpful","R3EQTGX3628IRG","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Greek Mythology Prometheus presumed to steal fire from the gods for the progress of mankind. He was banished, punished and bound for daring to interfere with domain of the gods.Similarly the author of Frankentein called her book the modern Prometheus, where a scientist presumed to usurp the very process of creation itself, and created a monster using lightning.In Prometheus the movie scientist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace, and her partner makes a series of scientific discoveries which shows that we were put here by extraterrestrials, and embark on a funded mission to a distant planet to meet these aliens.While the scientists aims are pure other people on board have mixed agendas. We have a soulless humanoid played by Michael Fassbender, and a ruthless female leader played by Charlize Theron and the mysterious owner of the company.Director Ridley Scott directed the Aliens series starring Sigourney Weaver, and I think Prometheus will please fans of Aliens and win new fans. Like Aliens we have a heroic female protagonist played by Noomi Rapace from the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series. Their arrival on the planet sets in motion a series of events with implications beyond the mission.While it appears to be a dead planet there is mischief on board the craft and danger on the planet itself.The alien planet is menacing as you expect, (so rarely do we meet friendly aliens), and if there are alien life forms they may not be friendly.There are several surprises and some well crafted scenes, which were quite originally done, including the duffel bag, and an improvised medical procedure which I found highly intriguing.One of my favorite lines from the movie: 'We may have gotten off on the wrong foot.'I love movies with a strong female protagonist, and Noomi Rapace really excels at this type of role. If you have seen the Alien movies, I think you will appreciate that he has given a style of science fiction that he pioneered a fresh and interesting twist. Who can forget that famous scene with John Hurt in the original Alien?Will Prometheus spawn a sequel? You could argue that it already has. I cannot speak as yet to how it will be on Blu Ray except to say that it was a visually stunning experience in the theater.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354E8Q8OLV06J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHY0#wasThisHelpful","R354E8Q8OLV06J","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having seen and been impressed by Brit Marling's other work Another Earth, it was with some enthusiasm I ventured forth to see this movie. As much as Another Earth has the ability to put on the appearance of being a bigger than Indie movie, The Sound of My Voice is clearly in the Indie tradition, and perhaps the reality tradition, yet manages to convey a sense of the mystical as well.A documentary filmmaker Peter, and his girlfriend penetrate the mysterious, inner workings of a cult. The members shower, are blindfolded, and driven to a secret meeting place. He is a schoolteacher with dreams of being a director. The mysterious and charismatic cult leader Maggie played by Brit Marling, has returned from the future, to save a select group of people, her followers. She breathes through a tube in the nose, yet occasionally removes the tube and seems to breathe with no bother.How one can get a camera in without being seen, and film without being noticed is a rather interesting question.On the surface she seems genuine and legit, though, if you're like me you will wonder, if she is a deluded soul or something more sinister. She appears to have extraordinary empathic and intuitive powers, yet some of what she does raises questions. She punishes bad behavior, and rewards compliance. I found it rather engaging, as when one member is ejected for asking questions, yet she claims this is not the reason for his ejection.Yet other members clearly become more compliant when she reacts like this. These tactics appear to work on the Peter, when she makes a very strange request of him, and she alienates him from his girlfriend. Maggie remains a mysterious character even to the end, with some intriguing twists and I loved the end.If you are new to Brit Marling's movies, I recommend Another Earth more highly. It won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival.Like Another Earth this is quite thought provoking, there are a few parallels such as the search for meaning, and in this case the search for truth.Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention and Brit Marling who was struggling like other actresses to get roles decided to go a different route and write the screenplays for the characters she would play and work with the directors she knew.I really admire that type of entrepreneurial spirit and this type of accomplishment.Last week I saw her in the Richard Gere movie Arbitrage so her strategy appears to have paid off.I do hope she will continue to make these types of movies as it brings a wonderful diversity to our moviegoing experiences.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109W44UY1GI7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007L6VQWW#wasThisHelpful","R109W44UY1GI7H","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to the Shakespeare Sonnets I have searched north, south and east, and discovered that of all the directions one can go West is best.When I read Shakespeare Wars by Ron Rosenbaum he recommended Stephen Booth's analysis of the Shakespeare Sonnets, although I find the presentation lacks the aesthetic of an artistic work and at times gets pretty technical which seems somewhat diminishing of the author's intent.When I read the Sonnets (No Fear Shakespeare)I loved the simplicity of putting a personal interpretation side by side with the Sonnets.  I think that the sometimes vague yet sensitive and allusive language is open to many interpretations and really is part of the mystery of the sonnets, so that book would be better if it offered more possible interpretations and hopefully the reader would wonder what else a word or line might mean to exercise and excite their own understanding.  Because it's inexpensive I use it for making notes.You can even get the Soonets for free because they aqre in the public domain having been written prior to 1923, if you want by downloading on your Kindle or Kindle app.  You will get the text without commentary and I like to search to track down a specific reference or theme.I also looked at The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets version.  It has all the aesthetics of an artful book even producing the original and modernised text yet I found it a little too logical and intellectual.I believe the best way to experience these poems is emotionally with some sensitivity and really to move beyond the ordinary world of consciousnessto the special world of the poet.I consider that West with his particular method offered me enlightenment and enhanced my understanding of several of the poems.  He publishes all the poems followed by one or two page essay/interpretation.  If I were to write a book on the Sonnets his book I think offers the best model for writing the ideal book at once both tought provoking and artistic.One of the mysteries of the sonnets is the apparent difference in experience between what is related in the Sonnets and the known facts of the life of Shakespeare.For we have themes of banishment, disgrace and scandal and anonymity, the dark lady and even the rival poet.  Scholars have attempted to explain this for many years. We know that Shakespeare was not touched by banishment digrace or scandal, and certainly not anonymous.  It has been explained as projection or role playing, although I believe they can be best understood and appreciated as deeply personal experiences.You would hardly choose to write poems about shame and banishment if they were not part of your personal experince, would you?I have also read Wraight's take on the The Story That the Sonnets Tell.  It's a book I would dearly love to own but is difficult to find and not inexpensive if you can.  It is possible though to read it online.  In terms of understading the author and the poems it yields the closest interpretation to the intent of the poet and offers another good model.Shakespeare was married yet the only real mention of a possible married relationship comes near the end of the book though the reference is to love and mistress not wife.Here are some lines on exile:How heavy do I journey on the way  Sonnet 50When what I seek, my weary travel's end,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'Scandal, exile:When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast state,And trouble deaf Heav 'n with my bootless cries,And look upon myself and curse my fate,  Sonnet 29Disgrace, banishment:Let those who are in favour with their starsOf public honour and proud titles boast,Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars  Sonnet 25Anonymity, death:The earth can yield me but a common grave  Sonnet 81Coward conquest of a wretch's knife  Sonnet 74So, if you want to get it here on Amazon as I write the price is on the lofty side.I encourage you to price compare with Amazon subsidiary Abebooks.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  West is best.  I hope this was helpful and encourage you to read or get the Wraight version too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1V2CQX0GKYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585679216#wasThisHelpful","RH1V2CQX0GKYX","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I am currently embarked on writing a book I went to see this movie not knowing much about it and found that it unexpectedly resonated with me.Briefly put it's a story within a story within a story. Bradley Cooper plays an aspiring writer married to Zoe Saldana. Life surely can't be that bad if you're married to Zoe Saldana. He sacrifices every other possibility to be a writer and finds that it challenges his manhood not to be living a life on purpose and in struggling to succeed.Everything changes when he discovers a tattered manuscript within the lining of his black leather attache case. Everyone who reads it acknowledges it as a masterpiece. It enables him to get his other works published and he gets all the acclaim he ever wanted. Only thing is the story is not his and soon the real writer appears played by Jeremy Irons who gives one of the best acting performances I have seen all year.A parallel story emerges with Dennis Quaid playing a writer telling the story played by Bradley Cooper which raises the question of whether it's truth or fiction and then we have the Jeremy Irons story within a story set near the end of WW2 in France and the events on which the book is based.If there is one thing I learned from this movie the number one reason to write a reason a book is not for acclaim or money or personal satisfaction, but book groupies in this case amply played by Olivia Wilde.How much of what a writer writes is imagination and how much personal experience?The Words poses that question and the answer is worth wondering about and I think the movie is well worth experiencing.If the story has one weakness I think the resolve is too easy, there's no real test of conscience or dark side.I think most people will find it thought provoking at least and as most people think about writing a book at some point, you may find some resonance with it as I did. Like most movies it will not please everyone. Hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AIXUXDA79YSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007REV58S#wasThisHelpful","R3AIXUXDA79YSH","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're thinking about buying this book you may be wondering what it contains and if it's worthwhile.I find that Tucker Brooke is one of the better scholars on the subject of either Marlowe plays and own several of his books including Shakespeare Apocrypha which contains the full text of fourteen plays some of which have been subsequently intorduced to the Shakespeare canon, and his book of English Drama 1580-1642 which has the complete text of 30 non Shakespeare plays from the era.The Marlowe canon contains 51 pages of criticism of Marlowe's known works.  What I found most interesting was reading about spurious or lost works.  For example, I did not know that Lust's Dominion was published as being by Marlowe for about two centuries until J P Collier found two pieces of external evidence which place the play as being written after 1598, and because of the supposed murder of Marlowe in 1593 this attribution was removed.Some of these out of copyright books you can read for free on archive and decide if you need to buy it.  I am certainly glad I bought this one, but I do always recommend you preview older books if you can so you know exactly what you are getting.  Unfortunately,  Amazon product descriptions are not as detailed as necessary on some of these older books.I also recommend you check out the books by Boas and Bakeless. Boas has written about both Marlowe and Kyd, and Bakeless I think is probably the best combination biographer and critic on Marlowe with highly impressive investigation skills.I think you will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5R4TLIX5KA7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1177320347#wasThisHelpful","R5R4TLIX5KA7P","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"More recently  as Steven Spielberg has become a more active producer, his directing credits are becoming less common.In 2011 he produced the brillant Super 8, one of my favorites, directed by JJ Abrams, the creator, writer and occasional director of Lost, and the recent Star trek. Super 8 is a great nostalgia piece evoking the early eighties, a movie within a movie, and an homage to Spielberg's earliest movies. Spielberg also produced Cowboys and Aliens, a somewhat weird meshing of two genres.Now with Warhorse Spielberg directs, and shows his masterful touches throughout. In fact, if you are like me you can see traces of many great movies of the past. The early portions of the movies showing English countryside scenes, and the musical soundtrack of John Williams are reminiscent of John Ford's The Quiet Man. Trench warfare scenes are reminiscent of that all time classic All Quiet on the Western Front. Incidents relating to deserting soldiers are thematically reminiscent of Kubrick's Paths of Glory.War, as bad as it is, somehow seems worse when an innocent animal is involved, which ultimately makes Warhorse the ultimate anti war polemic. And we have a love story between a young boy Albert, and a horse named Joey. As the movie begins we see the horse being born.Later Albert's alcoholic father instead of buying a proper plough horse, foolishly pits himself agaainst his own landlord in bidding for the flash horse Joey, instead of a huge Clydesdale, making his tenancy precarious, and imperiling his families limited fortunes. Joey faces many trials and tribulations adjusting to the plough. Here we have a wonderful perforamnce from Emily Watson as the mother, cruelly snubbed during awards season.When the war happens the father impulsively sells the horse to the military, despite Albert's protests. Albert, understandably distressed, too young to join the military, vows to be reunited with Joey. Meanwhile Joey goes to the front, and we have a poignant scene with his new owner. He and another horse escape the war briefly, and are adopted by a teenage girl. It's not long before the war interferes again, and Joey has a series of adventures.My favorite scene is when he gets trapped in No Mans land, and both sides have to cooperate to free him. I loved the wire clippers flying scene. I also loved the sub story about the two young German brothers, and the parallel structure about how the British deal with a similar situation.Ultimately the horse is a silent witness to the horror of war, becoming an effective storytelling metaphor.Later in the movie one scene I thought was a little overdone, the moment of blindfold recognition. I like to feel emotions in a movie, but not to have them evoked in a contrived way.Warhorse certainly deserves to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, yet I cannot help thinking that actors who vote for awards would prefer as I do to have the story centered around a human character. Nevetheless, when I was a child or young teen I loved watching movies like this, particularly Lassie Goes to war.Another movie I recommend if you don't mind subtitles is the French movie A Very Long Engagement (English Subtitled), starring Audrey Tautou, and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard. A girl seeks her boyfriend believed killed by being sent over the trench deliberately into no mans land for breaking military regulations. It has huge parallels with Warhorse except the protagonists are human, and also operates as a polemic. A beautifully filmed touching love story set against the war.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFIMD5HWRMCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072GPQNG#wasThisHelpful","R2AFIMD5HWRMCF","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned about this movie after seeing the Oscar nominated The Artist (DVD + Blu-ray Combo)also starring Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo and directed by Michel Hazanvicius.Dujardin bears an uncanny resemblance to Sean Connery which makes him a natural choice for this role. You may be surprised at how gifted he is as a comic actor, and how funny this movie is. Based on a series of French books called OSS 117 by Jean Bruce which appear to spoof James Bond, it's somewhat of a combination James Bond and Inspector Clouseau, and has a wonderful French ambiance, mood and soundtrack. The attention to detail is incredible.The first of over 100 OSS 117 books was written by Jean Bruce (JB) 4 years before Ian Fleming's 007 James Bond book. The books have been translated into 17 languages and sold over 75 million copies worldwide.Curiously, even though Hubert Bonnisseur de la Bath is a secret agent, people seem to know who he is. When a fellow agent and his best friend is killed he gets sent on a mission to Egypt and goes undercover as the owner of a chicken factory. An attractive young lady (Berenice Bejo) is his liaison, and he immediately rubs her the wrong way with his insensitive comments. As he hunts for clues he inadvertently upsets the local Muslims, when he silences a Muezzin who wakes him up with his yelling. And there are Nazis too.I also recommend OSS 117: Lost in Rio (English subtitled) featuring the same actor and director. I prefer the Cairo movie as it has both actors from The Artist. It's interesting to watch Dujardin's independently moving eyebrows in these movies.Dujardin has since since engaged an eyebrow coach to coax those wayward brows into submission in his sublime majestic turn as Georges Valentin in The Artist, which has been winning huge during awards season with 10 Academy Award nominations and seems to be destined for Oscar glory. Recently it won 7 BAFTA Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Music, and Cinematography.If you wish to watch the trailer paste OSS117movie into your browser press CTRL and hit enter.I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AD5JOJO4WGME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001APM44O#wasThisHelpful","R1AD5JOJO4WGME","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my favorite Oscar moments a few years ago came when after a highly distinguished career, fellow directors Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola finally presented Scorsese with his first and long overdue directing Oscar for The Departed.Throughout an illustrious directing career, Scorsese has directed some of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, such as Raging Bull, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, and The Aviator, and many many more.Not only is he a great director, he is also a tremendous movie scholar, responsible for keeping in circulation classic movies such as Thief of Bagdad, a 1941 masterpiece, which influenced him, Coppola and Lucas, and the classic Red Shoes by Powell and Pressburger.In addition he lectures in University on the movies, and you can get his dvd A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, which explores movies by well known directors of the past such as King Vidor, Fritz Lang, Cecil DeMille. Watching this made me realise the importance and contribution of the director.Hugo leads the Academy award nominations list this year with 11 nominations, closely followed by The Artist with 10, Warhorse, The Descendants, Midnight in Paris, all outstanding movies. Nominations for Hugo include Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.As the movie begins, in one extended shot we zoom through a bustling Paris railway station in 1931, and you become instantly aware that this is no ordinary movie. We meet a 12 year old urchin named Hugo who lives there. Circumstance has committed him to winding and repairing the clocks, and scrabbling for survival as a railway urchin, and we notice that he has a tremendous gift for repairing gadgets, be it watches, clockwork toys, or automatons. Although the story appears to be about a boy, it quickly morphs into a dual story as he comes into contact with a store owner in the station, from whom he steals, and his young granddaughter who befriends him. Secondary stories develop with various other characters at the station.The store owner played by Ben Kingsley is based on a real life character George Melies, and the story develops in simply amazing ways, and the urchin combines with a young girl to reveal a mystery to which she holds the key, a boy, a girl, an automaton, movie magic, and the story works in wonderful ways.I saw it in 3D and I believe this is the best way to watch, so see it if you can while it is still in the movies. As you watch the movie moves ticks along like clockwork, and we have extensive intricate imagery that I was at times simply in awe as I watched the movie, we have crosscutting between the events of the time, and silent movies, with parallellism and repetition from classic movies occurring in the actual story. This is where Scorsese's scholarship and love of the movies shows through, as the the two children meet a movie scholar who looks a little like Scorsese, and ultimately the movie becomes a homage to cinematic genius.Ben Kingsley does an extraordinary acting job, and I was particulaly gripped by one emotional moment few actors could do with the same effect. As you watch this movie, if you're like me you become totally transported, some of the imagery and ticking sound effects remain with me even as I write.Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, which explores storytelling with pictures, the author has also written The Hugo Movie Companion: A Behind the Scenes Look at How a Beloved Book Became a Major Motion Picture, a book which I happen to own, as I wanted to read about the naking of the movie.One thing I notice about Hollywood movies set in France in France is the convention of hiring using English actors to play French parts, and using American actors with English accents. Interesting. It turns out that Martin Socrsese and I share the same birthday so we share a little more in common than a love of the movies. I highly recommend this movie. It's quite spectacular.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4106FXU34FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5H5H4#wasThisHelpful","R2T4106FXU34FX","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I went to see this movie in December, inwardly I was lamenting the overall quality of movies in 2011, with a plethora of remakes, reboots and sequels, and I wondered if Hollywood was running out of fresh ideas, while recycling the same formulas.  Remakes/reboots in 2011 included  Straw Dogs, Footloose, Arthur,  The Thing, Conan, Spy Kids, Final Destination 5, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Some of the movies were high quality such as Girl with the dragon tattoo, and Xmen First Class.Last year Michelle Williams deservedly received her second Academy Award nomination for Blue Valentine, and now she is nominated for the role of Marilyn Monroe.  I liked this movie enormously, and was disappointed that it did not get nominated for Best Picture instead of Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, a dubious choice.Nevertheless politics being what it is  if MWWM was nominated it might give the appearance of Weinstein Studios having too much sway with the Academy Awards, as they also released the Artist with 11 nominations, and the appalling Iron Lady whose only redeeming grace is Meryl Streeps nominated performance, and last year had The Kings Speech.What Michelle Williams and the movie delivers is a very delicately nuanced and multi dimensional portait of Marilyn that we have not seen previously, those shifts in personality, her ability to be vunerable, to charm, to seduce and manipulate, and if you are Larry Olivier the ability to frustrate your ambition to make an incredible movie. In a perhaps ironic twist in view of recent events we see the entourage of people who can't say no or risk punishment or exclusion.So we have a young wideeyed  man who through connections gets his first job in the business working for Olivier, and responsible for keeping things even with Marilyn. If you're like me you wonder if he will be drawn too far into the web of Marilyn, and if the obvious siren attraction of Marilyn will be his doom.  They grow close and here is where the movie takes some liberties on the book on which it's based, but the will they won't they aspect will keep you guessing after the final credits roll.  The movie captures the period very well.Although most attention has focused on the performance of Michelle Williams, I loved the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier. He listened to Oliver on audio to perfect the mannerisms and the lines, and even had the exact same shoes custom made to fit the part.It seems fitting that someone who has spent a career following in Olivier's footsteps, acting Shakespeare and bringing the plays to the screen, may finally get the Academy Award for walking in his shoes.It's clear here that he is a superior actor, and perfectly achieves both his theatrical mannerisms and intonations particularly rolling the R's, and all the grand subtleties of the theatrical master.  At the end of the movie he delivers a portion of a soliloquy from Prospero in The Tempest.  This for me was like a spiritual experience, it was so sublime.  Naturally,  I hope that he wins although Christopher Plummer appears to the stern competition this year winning several awards in the runup including the Golden Globe.When I left this movie I felt optimistic and relieved at finally seeing a good movie.  Shortly afterwards all the best movies were released in time for an Oscar run including  The Descendants,  The Artist, Warhorse, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.  So, if you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.Recently we have seen a trend in the Academy Awards toward real life characters with Marion Cotillard winning for  portraying Edith Piaf, Helen Mirren for playing the queen, Colin Firth for playing a king, Christian Bale for playing an addict.  Usually the character has some flaw or adversity to cope with, tragedy, a stutter, addiction.  This year it's  Alzheimers, addiction/neurosis and racial discrimination.I loved this movie.  I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE47BHXNWSUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XTUB8#wasThisHelpful","RJE47BHXNWSUP","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're new to Adele you may be wondering which cd to buy.Recently, traveling overseas in the UK and Ireland, every house I visited seemed to have an Adele cd, usually belonging to a teenage girl or young lady. When I inquired further, nobody had anything but good to say about her. Even parents like her.Upon my return I bought 21 never having listened to an Adele song. By the time I got home from the record store I had listened to most of the album, and immediately ordered her other album 19.On youtube you may discover a Saturday night live skit about her song Someone Like you where cast members broke into tears when they heard this song. So later when I watched her on video, I had quite a strong emotional reaction to it, which is unusual.If one talks about Adele either a flattering comparative or a superlative might be in order.Not since the Beatles has an artist had two top five singles and albums in the UK charts simultaneously. Not since Madonna has a female artist held the number one position in the charts for 12 weeks consecutively before Adele with 21. In the Uk it's the bestselling album of the century so far beating Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Six million recoreds sold in the USA in 2011,  231 million views of Rolling in the Deep on youtube. Her previous album 19 sold more than 5 million copies. She has sold more than 4.1 million copies of 21 in Britain alone.  Now she has 6 grammy nominations winning 6, including Song of the Year for Rolling in the Deep, and Best Album for 21.Called 21 because that's how old she was when she wrote it. Several songs including Someone Like You and Turn The Tables are relationship driven pieces, inspired by an ex boyfriend, who broke her heart and inspired her art. The major hits are Someone Like You, and Rolling in the deep, although I find all the songs to be high quality. I have been listening to this album in the car, and only this album for about two weeks, and never pressed the skip button once.In interviews, refreshing and down to earth. Asked on Chelsea Lately about her ex boyfriend, she said: 'I believe he's living in a shabby apartment in London. I am staying in a very nice hotel around the corner.'Rarely have I experienced a singer who grabs your nervous system and drags you into her emotional world. At once she manages to sound both modern and retro. This album is very well produced, and in addition to her voice, we have great instrumentation with catchy piano fills and intriguing backing vocals from female singers, even a brass section on some tracks. If she reminds me of anyone it's Dusty Springfield, Son of a Preacher Man, but she is distinctly Adele..My only concern for Adele is her vocal issues, surgery with bleeding vocal cords, canceling her American tour. Having undertaken vocal training for several years, I know of several great singers who have lost their voices through flawed technique or overdoing it, the obvious example being Julie Andrews, so she needs to follow a proven successful method adopted by many successful singers, such as the speech level singing method which will protect and nurture her voice. It would be a tragedy if someone as talented as Adele was lost ot the world because of what would be preventable issues.If you are wondering whether 19 or 21 is better, get 21 first. Her voice is better. The song quality is better overall, the production values are superior. On 21 all the songs are good, and some of the songs are great. Not to say that 19 is not good, just that 21 is better. I love the energy of Rumor Has It, and also Turn The Tables, and Someone Like You is an iconic relatable anthem to lost love. I also love Rolling in the deep.One thing that intrigues me about her songwriting is her figures of speech, whether it is the metaphor of turning the tables or can you imagine what it's like to chase pavements, and can you really hit someone with your cold shoulder?I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6XRFOVSU0JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EBT5CU#wasThisHelpful","R2D6XRFOVSU0JY","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently,  I have become very interested in the subject of Christopher Marlowe, and read several books.I consider the scholarship in Marlowe books to be of a very high standard.  Now, if you wish to acquire the poetic works and the plays,  I recommend the Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe (Illustrated), which not only includes all the work, but source materials, and includes Lucan's Farsalia, and Ovid's Elegies aka Amores.  It also includes the book by Leslie Hotson, now out of print who discovered the inquest report in 1925 which identifies the murderer, Frizer, and gives the official version of what happened to Marlowe.You can also get the Scarsbrook The Life & Complete Works Of Christopher Marlowenot quite as complete on the works as Delphi, yet includes many other very interesting pieces, such as the Privy Council letter to Cambridge, the Flushing affair, the  accusation by Baines, the transcript of the Dutch church libel, Thomas Kyd's arrest and torture, and so forth, which may satisfy your immediate curiosity as it did mine till you get this book.Charles Nicholls reckoning, I consider a must own book, particularly as some of the great books such as Calvin Hoffman's book is tragically is out of print.As there is some doubt about whether you are getting the 1990s edition on Amazon USA, or the revised, 2002 edition, in which he substantially revised his original work, and indeed his conclusions,  I consider the latter version the must own version.  You can buy it on Amazon.co.UK, and as I write, even with shipping the price is substantially cheaper, about half price.The reason I got this book, was because I saw Nicholl interviewed on the PBS Frontline documentary, and it was clear to me that his investigation skills were impeccable, and that he worked with primary source material.  For example he develops the connections between different characters, and Marlowe, and unmasks much interesting information on people and events such as Richard Poley, witness and spy,  and the Babington conspiracy.As you read you enter the world of Elizabethan intelligence, where the wrong word to wrong people can result in torture and death, and nothing is as it appears to be, even the death of the prominent playwright of the era.  I will say that I do not necessarily agree with everything Nicholl concludes, but I do understand  that many people will agree with it.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10W1DQ1RV331H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226580245#wasThisHelpful","R10W1DQ1RV331H","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"32 of 38 people found the following review helpful: Reviewed September 8, 2011. Original reviews of this product have been deleted by Amazon.Michael John McDonagh previously wrote the screenplay for Ned Kelly starring Heath Ledger which I remember as a good movie. His brother Martin has won an Academy Award nomination, for Best Original Screenplay for In Bruges, which also starred Brendan Gleeson, and what I consider the best performance of Colin Farrell's career, and an Academy award for the short feature Six Shooter, A Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Films, also starring Brendan Gleeson, and at least two other characters you will see in The Guard, written and directed by MJ.As the movie begins we see Gerry Boyle, the guard played by BG, in his white squad car parked behind a stone wall, when a red car whizzes by. He does not respond to the speeding car. His response to what happens next, has no words, yet it establishes the nature of the character, as he rummages through pockets, and does something with the drugs. We can deduce that here is a guard that does not follow the established rules, and in fact may even be corrupt.Next we see him responding to a murder scene. Here we get a truer sense of his character by how he acts around the new cop who will be his partner. Here the comedic tone of the movie gets established. He likes to push buttons and get a reaction. They theorise about the murder, a potted plant placed on the victim's crotch, the significance of the number 5 1/2 painted on the wall. Perhaps he was the 5 1/2th victim, the young one theorises.Like another reviewer I was struck by the parallels with the Coen Brothers, particularly Fargo, and No Country For Old Men. Instead of the barren landscapes of Minnesota, and the quirky Nordic accents of Minnesotans, we have the bog landscape of the Wesht of Ireland, and the quirks and mores of the locals. We have sociopathic criminals. We also have the quirky Spaghetti Western music, reinforcing the ironic tone. We also have a trace of Ryan's Daughter, and a half cracked young lad on a bike, who mirrors John Hurt's character in that movie. We have murderous criminals who debate their favorite philosophers as they drive along.So, strait laced, by the book FBI agent Wendell Evers played by Don Cheadle, moseys into town, hot on the trail of an international smuggling ring hoping to land half a billion dollars worth of drugs in Ireland. Instantly, this sets up a culture clash, with Boyle making racially insensitive comments. When rebuked, his response. ""I'm Irish. Racism is part of our culture.""When Boyle is by himself he wanders his house in his red or yellow y fronts scratching. He does not seem like a brilliant cop. However, not following the book, opens up levels of resourcefulness for him. Guards don't carry firearms in Ireland, yet in a prescient way he manages to acquire weapons, donating the balance to the local IRA man who wears a cowboy hat. With his seeming amorality, you wonder if when push comes to shove, he will back off and let the criminals do their thing or if he will intervene.Perhaps my favorite scene, the second derringer scene, reminiscent of similar scenes at the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, and final scene with Woody Harrelson in No Country for Old Men. Life and death hangs in the balance.Boyle tells Evers he came fourth in swimming in the Olympics, which made me search the internet after the movie. The answer may surprise you.Another theme is the nihilism, which is that events have no inherent meaning, a consistent theme in several Coen Brothers movies.For non Irish speakers, our FBI detective attempts at one point to interview some Irish speaking people. In speech they refer to him as fear gorm, which the subtitle translates as black man. The word gorm actually means blue. If you were saying it literally, it would be fear dubh (pronounced far duhve).I know that some people claim that they cannot understand foreign accents. Where on earth do you hear more foreign accents than in North America on a daily basis? If I walk the streets of San Francisco, I will hear German, English, Chinese, Filipino, Mexican, South American, you name it. So, we have Oprah Winfrey, or Sigourney Weaver, narrating BBC produced documentaries because producers think customers cannot discern an English accent. The English in this movie is well spoken with a slight accent. West may be pronounced Wesht, just like Sean Connery doesn't say accent, he says ackshent. Even Schwarzenegger was not the governor of California, he was the governor of Callie phone ee yeah.I saw this at Robert Redford's Sundance Theater in San Francisco. It was an afternoon show, and the political incorrectness, and several American pop culture references, and fun poking commments resonated with the audience.If you wish to see Brendan Gleeson in another movie, I recommend John Boorman's The General, where he plays Martin Cahill based on a real life Irish gangster.So, I loved this movie. I think most people will feel the same way, and I think we have seen a great new talent with Michael John McDonagh, in a very impressive first outing as director. It's clear that talent runs in this family, and perhaps they see parallels between themselves as brothers, and the Coen Brothers. I don't think such a comparison is grandiose, and I wonder if they will work together on future projects. I believe that 'genius, in order to be emulated, must first be imitated.'Update. 11/30/11. Last week, on my flight back to San Francisco, I watched a program about the making of The Guard, which has become the highest grossing Irish made movie ever at the Irish box office grossing 4.3 million Euros, beating the previous best, The wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy. To put this this in an American context, it's about $1.50 for every man, woman and child in the country.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful. Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWY85DP07ETZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WAP2V0#wasThisHelpful","RWY85DP07ETZ8","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy comes to us with an impressive pedigree. Director Tomas Alfredson previously directed a critically, and publicly acclaimed vampire movie Let the Right One In, a foreign language movie, now remade as Let Me In starring Chloe Moretz. If you don't mind subtitles I highly recommend it, and the remake.Colin Firth won the Oscar last year. Gary Oldman, got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Mark Strong gave a great performance in The Guard, and Ciaran Hinds excels in playing spies, as in The Debt, and Munich.If you're like me you have neither read the book, nor seen the series starring Alec Guinness, so my experience of watching it fresh might be a good indicator.I probably would not have seen it if I did not accidentally meet someone in the movie business, who had seen Gary Oldman and the director do a presentation at their campus.When asked how he would like playing a stoic character, as opposed to his often passionate characters, he said he had waited thirty years to play a role like this, that often actors don't get to pick and choose their parts, but take what is offered and to put food on the table, and hope one day...As the movie begins, we become aware of a 'mole' at the circus, and an agent played by Mark Strong is sent to Hungary for a secret meeting to discover who it is. When complications arise retired agent, the stoic George Smiley played by Gary Oldman is brought out of unscheduled retirement to find the mole, the spy who despises his fellow spies. It's like a game of chess, with chess symbolism, where we read between the lines both of unfurling events, and Smiley's furrowed brows to gauge the churning depths beyond the stoic mask.He has a wife we never see, who cheats on him, and we anticipate a break in that stoic exterior, so as a study of character acting by Oldman this is a wonder to behold. In a way this movie sets out to be deliberately dull, somewhat the antithesis of the impression you get from a Bond movie, these men are bureaucrats, they ironically sing the Russian national anthem at office parties, not much seems to happen, they're not particularly interesting or handsome, with one or two exceptions, then the action livens up with an intrigue, betrayal and occasional murder.When the finger of suspicion points different ways, the 'circus' people suspected get very nervous, knowing full well what the outcome of that suspicion will be.As I sat very close to the screen, close enough to see the dots, I noticed the rather grainy footage like the detail of movies set in that era, the 70s. While I enjoyed it overall, this is definitely a more cerebral movie than say Bond, in fact it reminded me somewhat of The Good Shepherd, a movie I love, starring Matt Damon but which has gained mixed reviews. I think they were expecting The Bourne identity, instead of backroom antics at the CIA, the other circus.Several people around me left the movie early on, did not give it a chance, a yuppie sitting next to me, clearly on an early date, started immediately checking his iphone for other movie showings, was annoying, and thankfully they left shortly after to see a different movie. So this is not perhaps a date movie.I would say that I did not understand everything, some detail was lost I think in reducing this to a two hour movie. For instance, he gets a lighter from Magda,which seems important, who I assume was a woman but apparently was not. From an acting viewpoint, everybody gives a strong perofrmance, from a directing viewpoint, if you're like me you probably want more action, then it would not be what it is.I am now curious to check out the original with Alec Guinness. I think fans of Gary Oldman and/or Le Carre's original story will love it, and a varied response among other people. The movie also got nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.I hope this was helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L53B8GZPZO1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XTTXC#wasThisHelpful","R1L53B8GZPZO1M","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If like me you're into the whole Shakespeare thing, then this romantic comedy is well worth experiencing.Inspired by the prose piece Rosalynde by Thomas Lodge, the pastoral poetry of Christopher Marlowe, The Passionate Shepherd, and the romantic poetry of Edmund Spenser who would stick his poems on trees,here then a very endearing period piece, that captures the spirit of the play very well.  The name Ganimede appears in Marlowe's poem Hero and Leander, as is the title line above, quoted in this play.Helen Mirren does an absolutely excellent job playing Rosalinde /Ganimede, whose father becomes disinherited from his estate by his brother the Duke.  She is allowed to remain because she was raised from birth with her female cousin.When Rosalinde gets banished too, she and her cousin both head for the Forest of Arden, located near Stratford, and for safety she changes identity,  assuming the guise of a man.  Meanwhile her would be suitor, heartbroken, heads to the same forest, and pines and writes poetry which he sticks on trees.  When he meets her in her disguise he does not recognise her/him despite the common resemblance to Helen Mirren.  Several alternate romantic themes are developed with different with different characters simultaneously.The language reaches the very height of invention we have come to expect from Shakespeare.Her would be lover's life is in jeopardy from another parallel story.I have enjoyed this and watched it several times.  Now, if you have Amazon Prime,  as I write you can watch this for free, as you can watch many Shakespeare movies. Some of the BBC Shakespeare Tragedies DVD Giftboxcannot be bought separately, and can be quite expensive to get the whole collection, but again, as I write you can Derek Jacobi's BBC Shakespeare: Hamlet for free on Prime.If you like this I highly recommend Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, and you can watch it on Amazon video. Olivia Hussey, 15 at the time, gives a simply awesome performance as Juliet, and the movie conveys the wonderful passion of these star crossed.I think you will enjoy this and I hope this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HR46RMMT95WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KBGIXM#wasThisHelpful","R3HR46RMMT95WU","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Original review posted Nov 2009.. Deleted by Amazon along with many other original reviews of Blind Side.  Vote totals  115 helpful iut of 130. Save your movie reviews.I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012. So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so. For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself. He is the underdog we love to root for.The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description. Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommend Akeelah and the Bee, another five star movie. In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe for her performance.A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor. Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny. I predict this will be the year of the exception. Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice. This would be Bullocks first nomination.Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.I hope this was helpful to you, and I think you will enjoy the movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTLA9O0DYLWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VECM6S#wasThisHelpful","RCTLA9O0DYLWM","A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initially I was going to use this for video conferencing, however, my son decided that he could use it better for gaming purposes.Pros:1. Easy to use on a PC, you only need the USB cable, plug it in and you're ready to go. No drivers or software need to be installed.2. You can use it on a gaming console such as a PS3/PS4, XBOX/ XBOX One, via the USB cable. However, it will register as a headset on the PS4 and therefore you cannot record party sound with a capture card.3. The physical aesthetics are appealing, the surface and buttons have a good texture. Not that this matters much.4. It has five microphone settings, four of which are single direction microphones and the last setting is an omni-directional setting which activates all the microphones. These settings can all be changed with the simple push of a button.5. The microphone range is very good as I stood about eight feet away and the party on the other side heard me clearly. My son also uses the built in microphone for voice recognition when connected to his PS4. Cons:1. As noted by other users, it does not support mobile devices well. You would need a USB power source, such as a computer, and the audio cable. So it really doesn’t make much sense using it with a mobile device since you might need to get a PC to power it.2. Sometimes the party on the other end can hear their voice echoing. I don't know if this is due to the VX-1 or something else on their side.3.

"This is a pretty big mesh bag that looks exactly as pictured.It can easily hold a pair of training flippers, a pull buoy, goggles, kickboard, hand paddles and towel, plus other swimming gear.The material is breathable, so your gear can dry off in the bag, and so far has survived storage in the car trunk.The one problem is that the small pocket for keys and other small items is not waterproof, as even though it is solid at the front, the back is the mesh material of the actual bag.With this small correction, it would be a five star swimming gear bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TNG3XQS6MONU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EL3N0LI#wasThisHelpful","R3TNG3XQS6MONU","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router is replacing a Linksys EA2300 for use on a home network.Pros:1. Quick set up if using the supplied CD.However, if you are using this to replace another router, the CD setup could overwrite theprevious wi-fi settings on the computer you are using to set it up. Just reset the wireless password on your computer if you want to re-use your old settings.2. Good range, can get the signal up to at least 200 feet, but with poorto ""meh"" strength at this distance. Closer to the router, the strength isexcellent. We live in a concrete, two-storied house and get excellent tovery good signal strength in every room.3. Very good speed given the ridiculously pitiful bandwidth available where we live.However, the in-house gaming expert has reported that the download speed on his PS4 isslower than when we were using the older router.4. A cool feature is that you can attach an external storage drive to therouter using the USB port, and this  can then be accessed by otherusers/devices on the network.Cons:1. The biggest con is that it is very unstable. The ""limited signal strength"" notification pops up at the worst times - like during an uploading process, and it requires re-booting at least once every other day, even with the firmware upgrade. Hopefully Linksys will release another firmware upgrade in the near future that will improve the stability.2. IPhone 4S users may have a problem connecting to this router. The iPhone 5 and 6 don't seem to have this problem.3. Takes up a good chunk of real estate on the desk.Even with the good range and fast internet speeds, I gave this router 3-stars due to the frequent need to re-boot it.Note:After posting this review I received information from the manufacturer (see comments below) that solved the re-booting problem.Kudos for great customer service.I now give this router 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXFW866UZC8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19M72#wasThisHelpful","R3JXFW866UZC8I","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beginning with the meticulously planned execution of a wealthy jet-skiing jet-setter, this impressive first novel powers along at similar breakneck speed, gathering momentum all the way to almost the final chapter - said final chapter providing the perfect conclusion to this remarkable story of greed and revenge.The author captures the reader's attention right away, and then establishes his realistic characters, weaving seemingly unrelated story lines into a cohesive multi-genre thriller.  Set for the most part in the Republic of Turkmenistan in Central Asia, a hired killer begins eliminating the relatives of a powerful businessman.  Head honcho of a mega-empire, the businessman has plans to construct a natural gas pipeline leading to Pakistan and India, and is in talks with an American company to make it happen.With the realization that someone is eliminating his nearest and dearest, and with money not being in short supply,  he hires his own private ""consultant"" to investigate on his behalf outside of regular channels, and fortuitously, the consultant, an ex-Green Beret, happens to have the necessary skills for the job.Just when you think you know where the story is going, along comes a chilling twist with the introduction of a power-play, the repercussions of which could cause deadly serious international conflict.Recommended reading for fans of thrillers with twists, action-junkies, and anyone who still appreciates a good book.Amanda Richards, September 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I62VFIU44C1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IO5YB8K#wasThisHelpful","R1I62VFIU44C1G","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an awesome little toy for your iPhone 5, but obviously with limitations - you can't expect Carl Zeiss technology for this price after all.You get a fisheye lens, a wide angle lens and a macro lens in a device the width of your phone.  To access the macro lens you need to unscrew the wide angle lens. It comes with lens caps and a drawstring carrying case.Limitations include:1. You can't have a protective screen on your phone as the fit is THAT snug2. No flash when using this attachment3. You need to take it off when calls come in4. You need a very steady hand to get crisp macro images, and you need to be thiscloseupto your subject5.

"Pros:1. The 102 is small enough for everyday toting - great size for everyday working folk who always keep their camera close at hand.2. Enough space in the main compartment for a DSLR with medium telephoto/standard zoom lens attached, plus an off camera flash and one more lens.3. Easy zippers allow quick access to the camera, and support straps keep it secure.4. Comes with an all weather cover neatly tucked away in a pocket and a built in microfiber cloth.5. Two external compartments and a pocket for small accessories.  Handy memory card pockets in main compartment.6. Includes a tripod holder and strap7. Nicely padded with customizable dividersCons:1. The 102 is a lot smaller than it looks on-line.  A Nikon SB900 flash can't stand upright as illustrated, but has to be pivoted over the DSLR compartment.2. The upper compartment can't hold a change of clothes, or anything other than small accessories, keys, a wallet and a couple of calling cards.  It can hold filters, a small lens or a point and shoot camera.3. Can only hold compact tripods or monopods, and even then, it becomes unwieldy.4. If you sling the strap over one shoulder, the bag isn't balanced and keeps slipping off your shoulder, especially if you're doing anything with your other hand.5. If you sling it over your head and across your back as illustrated, it's stable, but not comfortable for the female anatomy, and certainly not aesthetically pleasing for frontal views.6. If you use the additional support strap, it doesn't fit around your waist as it should, but across your chest, hence even more problems for female photographers with curves.7. No place for water bottle, no cell phone pouch on strapI bought this to use for everyday toting of my DSLR.  Size wise it works for this purpose, but is not comfortable to walk around with.  It's not big enough for travel or comfortable enough for nature shoots, or weddings, or suitable for anywhere you'll need extra gear, water or clothes.  Definitely not for a theme park or hiking expedition.I would recommend this to male urban or street photographers (or non-zaftig female photographers).Amanda RichardsJuly 22, 2013","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVURL4R2A8NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003656Q7C#wasThisHelpful","R3GVURL4R2A8NY","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, this is a monopod, and should not be expected to perform the duties of a tripod.  The two are not on the same playing field, especially if said field is not level, and the monopod's job is simply to hold the fort when a tripod can't go into battle.Pros:1. This monopod comes with its own little stand, and is perfectly capable of standing on its own three feet.2. It can easily support a DSLR with a medium telephoto lens.3. Set up is simple, requiring only unscrewing the bottom section, opening the legs and screwing the base back on securely.4. Extends over six feet tall with two adjustable sections5. Perfect for concert and theatre events in low or changing light, when a tripod either isn't allowed or is impractical.6. Great for weddings and museum visits7. You can sit with the monopod braced against your chair and your feet anchoring the legs for extra stability. (I also use a cable release)8. Padded grip9. Handy against attacks by stray animals in the wild.Cons:1. At the shortest it's still more than two feet long, and doesn't fit well in the external tripod section of smaller camera bags.2. It's very heavy for all-day trekking around theme parks, museums, big city tours and the like.3. No carrying case (but has a strap to fasten it on to stuff)4. Little legs make a lot of noise when concealed (but see below)5. A bit tricky on uneven ground if you want to use the legsThings you can fix:1. Needs a Quick Release head (albeit adding extra weight and cost)2. Rattling feet can be muffled with a rubber bandOverall, I'm happy with this monopod, except perhaps for the length and weight. It does a great job when you're rushing around in crowded places where tripods fear to tread.Amanda Richards, June 19, 2013","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYUAQAR62R13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PSF9O#wasThisHelpful","RVYUAQAR62R13","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior experience: First set of dedicated gaming earphones.Used with: PS3 - I don't have an Xbox360.Using the Quick Start Guide that was supplied, the cable connection part was easy enough, but the overall setup experience was a bit of a pain - first pairing the headset with the PS3 via Bluetooth, and then configuring the PS3. I didn't get any sound out of it at first (except for it telling me that it was powered on or politely saying goodbye) until it was fully charged, and then everything fell into place after that. It needs to be paired with the PS3 first as instructed or you cannot set it as your input/output device in the PS3 settings.There are three modes - game, movie and music. With game mode, you can choose from eight presets to enhance your gaming experience. There are also about eight presets for chatting, some of which can alter the sound of your voice. In addition, you can plug your headset into your computer and go to the Turtle Beach website (http://www.turtlebeach.com/community/preset-community) to customize the sounds of your favorite games to give yourself a competitive advantage, or to immerse yourself in the game through the use of audio presets and voice prompts. You will need to register to get access to the customization tools and to download Turtle Beach and Community created audio presets.The sound quality is excellent for game play, (for example, you can hear the footsteps of your opponents even before they come around a corner) as well as for chatting with other players while playing. In addition, the earphones are very comfortable for long hours of use and block out any surrounding noise.Another great feature is the Dolby surround sound. There are six easily accessible settings that you can use to get the effects to suit your current gaming mood.It takes about 6 hours to charge, but this is not a problem as you can continue playing while it is charging. The manufacturer states that a full charge lasts about 15 hours, but due to real life interruptions I have not been able to verify this.The headset can be paired via Bluetooth to two Bluetooth enabled devices simultaneously. For example, you can chat via your PS3 when playing a game and still receive/make phone calls, but I haven't tried the phone part as yet. There are separate Bluetooth volume controls on the right ear cup to adjust the chat/phone volume (Game volume controls are on the left ear cup)Finally, using the mobile device cable supplied, you can plug it into any regular earphone jack and the headset can now be used as regular earphones with your audio device (music/MP3 player, computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.)Overall, the sound is great and truly enhances your entire gaming experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R47VDU2EEIY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3PDH5G#wasThisHelpful","R3R47VDU2EEIY1","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not only that, but each doll ""likes"" a food item beginning with the first letter of his or her name. The dolls representing U, X and Z have a bit of a problem finding a favorite food, but the author finds a way around this dilemma.A couple of suggestions would be for the names and food items to better reflect the nationality/theme of the individual costumes, and also for the food items to be shown as real photographs (like the dolls) instead of drawings.

"Point of View: Hobby/AmateurCameras: Nikon D7000/D600I would not have purchased this lens if it hadn't come with the D600 as a kit lens, but I am SO glad that Nikon knows best.  As a medium telephoto zoom lens, I use it on the D600 most of the time for capturing landscapes and street photography.At 24mm it's wide enough to capture everything from foreground elements to distant landmarks, and at f/3.5 it's fast enough to get the wedding party in a church (if the lights aren't too dim) without using a flash.When it comes to festivals and carnivals, I use this on the D600 for the big picture, and a 50mm f/1.8 on the D7000 for street portraits.  It is light and unobtrusive enough to take into crowded places for extended periods, something I would never do with a 70-200mm f/2.8.What it's not good at is wildlife photography and sports photography, but there are other lenses for those purposes. The only thing I don't like is the lens hood, which when inverted over the lens completely blocks the zoom ring.  It also gets in the way when you're trying to remove the lens from the camera. If I don't need to use the hood, it's easier to take it off completely than keep it on-camera.Overall, a compact, convenient and affordable lens for general purpose and vacation photography.Note: Uses a 72mm screw-on filterAmanda Richards, February 3, 2013","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKLJ0379OGPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B14TQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2BKLJ0379OGPQ","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:1. Easy to set up - no tools required. Just attach the stainless steel/aluminum mount to the tripod socket at the bottom of the camera and tighten the thumbscrew. (And recheck ever so often that it's tightened)2. Fits a lot more comfortably than a regular neck strap.  All DSLRs should come with this type of strap.  No neck burn or awkward carrying positions.3. Can be tightened against the body by pulling on the pivot ring and camera (in opposite directions) for when you need to go hands free across some difficult terrain (or when your hands are otherwise occupied)4. Can be worn on either shoulder or even behind your back as needed.5. There's a locking mechanism to hold the strap in place when you're not shooting.6. Strap adjusts itself and extends when you raise the camera to take a shot (when the locking mechanism is disengaged of course)7. This strap is built for a man, (the women's strap has a small curve for the zaftig photographer) but it's still comfortable (and strong enough) regardless.Cons:1. Dangling an expensive camera and even more expensive lensupside down,from ONE screw,in ONE spot,on the bottom of the camera,is a bit nerve-wracking. (But regular straps can malfunction also)2. Strap could have been improved with a bit more padding.3. Strap takes up quite a bit of space in a camera bag (but you can't have everything) For smaller bags you can detach the strap and reattach when needed in a couple of seconds.4. Obviously you have to detach the strap when you want to use a tripod5. No fault of the strap, but the models in the video on the product page need some instruction on how to hold a DSLR properly (LOL)Overall, this has solved a big problem for me, as this is a much more comfortable way to carry around a heavy camera and lens for hours at a time.Amanda Richards, January 8, 2013Note: I recently bought the women's version of this strap.

"I bought this because when you can't afford Nikon glass, you choose Sigma.One of three (arguably) most recommended wedding lenses, the others being a 50mm f/1.4 or f/1.8 prime and a 24-70 f/2.8, my experience with this is creamy dreamy soft backgrounds with perfectly focused subjects.  Please note that this is an amateur point of view, and I shoot weddings when the bride or groom asks whether I'm going to walk with my camera, because the camera takes really good pictures.I love it for details like the decorations, cake and candles, for far off shots of the ceremony without getting in the way, and for those cool shots where the bride/groom is in focus and the groom/bride beside her/him is out of focus (but very recognizable)What I don't like is the weight (but I can suck that up) and that you can't work the group shots without changing the lens (until I get a second camera) unless you're standing way back, which isn't always possible.I also love it for portraits, especially of toddlers, and will be trying it next at a field hockey game, as I understand it to be aces at sports.  I bought the Sigma APO Teleconverter 2x EX DG for Nikon Mount Lenses which works fine with this lens, and plan to go stalking hummingbirds as soon as they discover my Aspects 153 Mini Hummzinger Hummingbird Feeder.If you need to shoot in low light, and prefer ambience instead of the brightness of flash, this fast lens and some ISO pumping can really do the job.

I didn't expect the ear buds to be comfortable with that funny looking rubbery plastic thingy that fits into your outer ear, but I was wrong (using the smallest size - it comes with three sizes)  Plus, they don't fall out of your ears if you make sudden movements.5. Control for volume and the audio jack are on the same speaker, so easily kept within reach6. Sleek modern look7. Not designed for noise reduction, so you can still be aware of what's going on around you.Cons:1. No ""off"" position - the volume can only be turned down, but not off2. Speakers are a little on the large side if you're limited for space on your desk - just over 7"" tall, 3"" wide and just about 6"" deep3. Ear bud case is nice, padded and zippered, with Bose logo, but is too big to fit in your pocket.  My iPhone actually fits comfortably inside the case.4.

"Reading the book description on Amazon confused the heck out of me, but fortunately, the book itself is much more reader-friendly, with charming black& white and spot color illustrations in abundance.Halloween-based, it tells the tale of a royal family preparing for the big night of pumpkins, tricks and treats.  Following an untimely act of clumsiness, the young prince is so upset (read ""hissy fit"") that he gets beside himself in a very literal sense.Although his family is quite understanding and forgiving, he has to do a lot of soul-searching to make things right.Part humorous and part introspective, the ending doesn't quite fit with the gist of the story, but the illustrations greatly contribute to a brief, entertaining read.Amanda Richards, October 19, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSGRVII346LVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621371360#wasThisHelpful","RSGRVII346LVW","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".. and horses and birds.A collection of four quiz books featuring the aforementioned critters, this interactive offering serves up fun facts and trivia in a multiple choice format.  Readers select the best answers to a series of questions, and tap the screen to lock in each answer (or educated guess)A correct answer brings showers of high praise and a chance to move on to the next round, while an incorrect answer results in a sometimes not-so-subtle rebuke and a chance for a do-over.  A correct answer reveals further information, expanding on the original answer.Navigation forward is easy enough, but if you want to take a step backwards or go to a random question it gets a little tricky.Of course, one can only go through this sort of book once, (unless you have short term memory loss) but at least you will have learned lots of fun facts (that you may or may not require for normal daily functioning.) As a bonus, there are color photographs accompanying each question, and a section at the end of each book for punny humor guaranteed to induce groans &/or smiles.An interesting and entertaining collection of animal info you may probably never need, but hey, you never know.Amanda Richards, October 18, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1WZS3ZPU60N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZHF7BM#wasThisHelpful","R1B1WZS3ZPU60N","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just a small town girlJust a city boyFor a smile they can share the nightAnd it goes on and on and on and onA huge cast ensemble hams it up big time in this just-for-laughs musical about the big-haired decade of slammin' rock anthems.  Although totally cheesy, completely formulaic, and universally abhorred by critics everywhere, there are three reasons to watch this.1. Rock anthems, ballads and combinations thereof (sung enthusiastically but horribly by everybody except Mary J.)  Any fan of `80s rock will be so totally immersed in the music that you won't notice that the performances give karaoke a bad name.2. Vertically-challenged Tom Cruise strutting his leathers and furs like he's the biggest, baddest, raunchiest rock star that ever lived.3. The costumes, the hair, the cell phones, those round black things sold at Tower Records, the promiscuity, and oh yes, the sugar-sappy-sweet romance story-line.Forget the corny plot, Russell Brand's wig and the minor roles played by major talent and consider this a time capsule from the `80s that crash-landed on a DVD player near you.Amanda Richards, October 8, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R157H8EOU2PU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHR2#wasThisHelpful","R1R157H8EOU2PU","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Witch + Vampire = GoddessFollowing on from ""Reborn"", ""Perdition"" clears up some of the unanswered questions about Lily, a young woman born to become the Goddess of the Night.  The child of Nathaniel and Claire, she is half Vampire and half Witch.Still unsure of her powers and the job requirements, she descends to the Underworld to find Nyx, her predecessor, for a crash course in Goddess 101.  Getting there without a GPS is hard enough, but she also has to face Hades, and convince him to lead her to Nyx.While she's occupied down under, her friends Xander and Drew (Vampire cousins) and Roxy (a Witch) attempt a daring rescue mission to free Roxy's parents and hopefully get some intel on the whereabouts of Lily's parents.  There they face off against Samuel, the Great High PooBah of the Witches, and a Vampire betrayal of epic proportions.Romance, adventure and mythology mix in the continuing story of the Goddess of the Night, but as in book one, some editing is required for grammar and to tighten up the dialogue.

"What hath 50 Shades wrought?  Given that the insanely popular FSOG is probably one of the worst-written examples of the erotic romance genre, any similar book looks pretty good in comparison.This one follows the same pattern of controlling rich hunk (this time appropriately in the business of high security) and exasperating hot chick (art student/model) hooking up frequently and passionately, and of course each has a deep, dark secret that they can't stop fighting, making up and/or canoodling long enough to reveal to each other.  Said canoodling is very descriptive as opposed to being overly repetitive, and being so small in size, this book is a heady (no pun necessarily intended) one sitting read.Naturally, the steamy relationship can only go on for so long before something gives, and the problem with this book is that it ends rudely with an ""interruptus"" just as it starts to get interesting story-wise.  It will be interesting to see what follows from here in.Amanda Richards, October 2, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1USK4GZB01V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092FJKFU#wasThisHelpful","RZ1USK4GZB01V","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This darker hue of 50 shades takes BDSM to a new level, when a suave, rich, handsome hunk of a man makes an indecent proposal to an innocent young girl and lures her into his dungeon.  Like the entranced fly, she can't resist his charms, and soon has signed on for ten nights of exploration and discovery unlike anything in National Geographic.Introduced to an alternative lifestyle by her closest friend, Leah is shocked to the core, but unable to hide or explain the excitement she feels as an observer to a real-life version of dungeons and dominators.The lines of love and lust get very blurry as the story progresses, and even though she has a magic word that will make it all go away, she is loathe to use it, despite being repeatedly forced way out of her comfort zone.Richly descriptive in skin tingling detail, the dialogue is repetitive and could have used some editing to make a better reading experience.  Let's face it though - if you're thinking of buying this novel, it's more than likely that you're not going to be paying too much attention to how many times Rhett coos ""my beautiful girl"" to a blushing Leah.Amanda Richards, September 27, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TAVOA6241PRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092TGT5A#wasThisHelpful","R1TAVOA6241PRX","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a book for photographers of all levels, and it doesn't matter whether you're using an iPhone, a point and shoot, or something fancy like a ""first purchase when I win the lotto"" Nikon D4.Basically it encourages you to get out of the old ""there's nothing worth taking in my area"" mode and shows you ways of reinterpreting everyday objects through different angles and techniques.It includes exercises to ""see beyond the subject"" and look for unique viewpoints, contrast, juxtapositions, shadows and reflections, among others. The chapter on the Lensbaby lens is extremely interesting.  None of the content is overly technical or jargon-infused.  There are also lots of full colour examples with all the exif data included.So, if you're not one of the lucky few who get to travel to exotic locations for your photographs, reading this may just provide the inspiration to go make masterpieces from much closer afield (or the nearest open field of grass)As the authors say ""Make every day an artistic day""Amanda Richards, September 19, 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SJ7Z8YV9550/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081743593X#wasThisHelpful","R6SJ7Z8YV9550","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're one of the four, maybe five people in the world who haven't read that little Shades of Grey book, then you're in for an erotic treat with this one.If you've already gone through the ""rolling eyes, biting lip, inner goddess, control-freak, twitchy palm"" saga, then you may agree that this is the same story, but rewritten by someone with a better command of the English language.I would suggest that instead of filming ""Grey"" on its own, producers could work on a tag-team approach, as Team Christian-Ana battles Team Gideon-Eva for bragging rights on being the most damaged partnership in the arena.The main difference so far is that it took three books for E. L. James to get her plot together (or even remember to include one in the story), while Sylvia Day nails it for the first 99% and then forgets to include an ending.

"Hatred is a powerful thing, and when it is driven by racism and the desire for power - well that's something else entirely.Introduced at an early age to an extremist military group, the main character of this thriller finds himself indebted to the group who financed his education in preparation for his progression to bigger things.  Sealed with blood and sworn to ""God, Country, The Order"", he learns that he will be posted to Washington to further the work of the order.The problem with this is that our hero, Scott, isn't really convinced about the whole ""America for Americans"" philosophy and hasn't bought in to his family motto and traditions.Issued with his first work orders, he reluctantly sets off to do his master's bidding, and as you would expect, things go extremely wrong.  Finding himself on the wrong end of the food chain, he struggles to extricate himself from the tangled web, and ends up fighting for his life, and the lives of his new friends.  From here on in it's an action-packed man-hunt - from shoot-outs and car chases in the desert to high artillery warfare in the Capitol.Fast-paced and easy to read (although in need of some minor editing), this page-turner is another winner from this author.Amanda Richards, September 19, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1RRP2TBX742/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0967279348#wasThisHelpful","R1T1RRP2TBX742","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the 1950s and `60s, this book can be found on many school book lists in the Caribbean as assigned reading for English B (literature) classes for Grade 7 (Form 1) students.The main character is a Jamaican boy who is preparing to write the Government examinations to determine his placement in the high school system.  Nicknamed ""Sprat"" due to his partiality to the local fish delicacy of that name (made from a relative of the herring family), he is described as a fat and untidy child, and not especially brave or athletic.The chapters that follow and the illustrations in the book seem to prove that description somewhat inaccurate, and Sprat turns out to be a relatively responsible and lively boy with a good head on his shoulders.Among his escapades, he orchestrates the rescue of an elderly woman from a bush fire, travels with his family to the supposedly haunted ""Duppy Bay"" on the northern coast of the island, and remains by the side of his sick friend who may or may not have contracted a terrible disease.Colorful characters in name and nature (Four Finger Jones, Mother Rebecca Silvera, One-Foot Charlie), exciting (albeit somewhat far-fetched) escapades, and a large dose of local culture, humour and dialect add up to an entertaining read for younger readers now getting their first feel for literature.Amanda Richards, September 19, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BLAT65MJRIZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0582052076#wasThisHelpful","R1BLAT65MJRIZG","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The unlikely hero of this complex (and rather long) spy thriller is a young engineer who just wants to build a better sailboat and live peacefully with the love of his life until the closing credits of happily ever after. Unfortunately for him, his dream becomes quite a bit more complicated when a tragic event overturns his life plan, pushing him way beyond his comfort zone and into the pre-stages of WWII.While trying to uncover the truth about the aforementioned tragic event, he finds himself caught between the obligations of his job and loyalty to his friends, and is even forced to deny the woman he loves.An unexpected business trip to Germany in the company of a mysterious femme fatale leads to further problems on all fronts, and soon he's fighting harder than he ever did in the boxing rings of his youth.  As can be expected from the ""Fulcrum"" part of the title, he gets landed (involuntarily) with a pivotal role in determining the outcome of an inevitable war.This novel has something for everybody - intrigue, politics, action, romance - even geography, history and sailing.  The hero? Well, he's not your suave superman by any means, and even though you'll want to thump him upside his head for his lack of finesse, you'll still be rooting for him in the end.Amanda Richards, September 18, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R72IRBJJ794T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074HGO4S#wasThisHelpful","R1R72IRBJJ794T","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel takes place in two time periods - one present day, and the other the time of Shakespeare and company, where uttering the wrong words could lead to public humiliation and missing body parts.  (Actually, this could apply to both time periods)The present-day leading character is a firm believer that Shakespeare was a poseur, who wasn't smart enough to write the works attributed to him, and a recent discovery may be the key to proving this theory.Switching between the sixteenth century and now, the author relates the story of Christopher Marlowe, who may have been Shakespeare's ghost writer, and ties this in with a letter, a painting and three leather-bound books just screaming to be decoded.Naturally, this theory doesn't go down well with the Shakespeare fans, and the plot evolves into a good old action/adventure thriller as the various characters play ""hot potato"" with the evidence, and members of the mysterious secret society of the pelican and chicks keep popping up.Ultimately, the author serves up the evidence in the first half, provides the action in the second, and leaves it to the reader to decide who's left with the hot potato.Amanda Richards, May 29, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF1HU2RCU9NOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061JPT78#wasThisHelpful","RF1HU2RCU9NOV","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This action/adventure thriller begins in the middle of an unauthorized mission in Mexico, with tough guy Lee McCloud sucking on a pebble while squinting down the sight of his sniper rifle at a group of kidnappers.  The objective is to rescue two teenage girls before they get dragged into a human trafficking network, but of course things don't go according to plan, or this would be a very short book indeed.One round of disciplinary action later, McCloud is given no choice but to join a secretive Government agency, but even though he's on their dime, he refuses to forget his original mission and the two girls.Thus begins the real action of this story of terrorism, human trafficking, espionage, good old fashioned double-crossing and many examples of man's inhumanity to man, amidst the setting of luxury yachts, impenetrable fortresses and shark infested waters, from Paris to Dubai and the island of Andaran.The action is non-stop, but at some points I felt as if there was just too much going on, and had to go back to make sure I had all the characters and facts straight.  After all was said and done, the ending was extremely anticlimactic and I felt that there was room for improvement in this area.

If you've read the first two books, you're so accustomed to the erotic scenes on every other page that they become routine, and you get to focus on the other things going on that don't involve Mr. and Mrs. Grey fighting and then making up lustily.In episode three, the reader learns more about Grey's childhood and adolescence, and why he is the way he is, and also reveals the reason behind the sabotage in book two.  It also involves an attempted kidnapping, a revenge plot, and closes some doors on Grey's past encounters.The writing is slightly improved, even though there are eye-rolling lines such as the one describing Mr. Grey as ""The state lottery, the cure for cancer, and the three wishes from Aladdin's lamp all rolled into one""Cutting half of the almost identical erotic scenes, all but one of the lines describing the fit of Christian's pants, and removing the ""Oh My's"", ""Holy Cr@ps"", inner goddesses and lip biting, this could have been condensed into one steamy blockbuster novel instead of three.Much, much better than book one, and certainly better than book two.Rated: 3.5 starsAmanda Richards, April 27, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S1K65T7J4VAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IXWL2C#wasThisHelpful","R2S1K65T7J4VAJ","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brief recap of overused phrases/sentences:Holy Cow!My inner goddessYou're mine!I love you!Don't leave me!Cr@p!After the big blow-up and walk out that ended book one, Miss Steele and Mr. Grey are at it again, exchanging repetitive phrases ad nauseum and trading jealousy and insecurity between hot steamy sessions and endless ripping open of condom wrappers.  I'm glad they're being safe, but really didn't need to know about that particular detail, each. and. every. time.  (yeah, little words with full stops for emphasis are also unnecessary)That said, this second installment is much better than the first, and not just because she doesn't say ""Oh My!"" as much, but there's actually a story with some background and even a few twists.  Other characters get some page space, the BDSM becomes something akin to love instead of lust, and we begin to understand Mr. Grey's strange behavior. (Her thinking processes remain a puzzlement)The writing is still YA with an R rating, but at least a lot happens in this book outside of the bedroom (or wherever) and the ending makes one hopeful for book three.

"Anyone who doesn't own an iPod or iPad probably won't see the utility of this device. However, for those who know the limitations of a 16GB iDevice, this can come in very handy to extend your storage.One caveat is that given the cost of the Airstash at the time of writing, if you haven't yet taken the iPlunge, it might be better to go with the 64GB iPad 3 or 2 in the first place. However, if you already own the 16GB, then getting this device becomes an economical option.The tech specs are covered in the product description, so below are some of my observations based on my experiences using the Airstash with an iPad 2.Once the Airstash is powered up (by holding down the power button until the green indicator light turns on, then releasing it to see the light flash rapidly three times), you can connect your device to it wirelessly. However, in order to take full advantage of the Airstash, you will need to install the Airstash+ app which you can download from the Apple AppStore for free. This app allows you to access the files that you have copied to the Airstash. Alternatively, you can use a browser and browse to airstash.net for the same functionality.While it may look like a flash drive on steroids, and works in a similar fashion when you plug it into your computer's USB port, I found it was not as straight-forward a matter when being used to save files. Accessing the files you have placed there is simple enough, but in order to save stuff to it using your iPad/iPod, your app needs to be WebDAV compatible. The Quick Start Guide supplied with the device briefly mentions that once connected you `launch the WebDAV compatible app of your choice'.Now, if you're like me, then you probably have no idea what this means. What I've discovered is that WebDAV is some kind of `format/protocol' that allows you to save your files to the Airstash. The problem is, not all apps are WebDAV compatible. Apple's Pages, Numbers and Keynote are, but QuickOffice isn't. So if you're a Microsoft Office user like I am, accustomed to QuickOffice, then this device might not be for you. You can read your Office files from the Airstash, but you wouldn't be able to edit them and save them back to the device.Other observations...Without installing additional software/apps, mp4 (movie) files on the Airstash played easily on my iPad, but not avi files. (I didn't try digital movies but the product description says that you can play movies loaded on it on your device.)I couldn't figure out how to save stuff directly onto it that I had downloaded to my iPad, like apps, attachments, books, etc. Maybe there is an easier way, but I had to sync my iPad with my computer first, then copy the files over to the Airstash from the computer.The iPad could open epub books (in iBooks) and pdf files saved on the Airstash. Presumably there shouldn't be any problems with music and photo files, but I didn't test these either.It took about 8 minutes to transfer 366MB from my (old) laptop to the Airstash using USB 1.0. With newer computers this should be faster.Some pros, some cons - consider this is you have an iDevice that needs more storage space.Amanda Richards April 20, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOF7ZRFZ2HB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006473T9M#wasThisHelpful","R1QOF7ZRFZ2HB8","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately for Mildred, she hasn't inherited her mother's bad genes, and she soon learns that it's really bad to be good.Imaginative and non-formulaic, this is a mix of magic, witches, giants, kings, curses and alligator pancakes, rolled into a compact one-sitting thoroughly enjoyable read.

"This is the third installment of the Jack Nightingale series, and once again, our hero is jumping head first into situations he knows absolutely nothing about.  I believe that this should not be read without reading the first two, as you need to know how Nightingale's thought processes (or lack thereof) work, and what drives him to pursue the supernatural.In the first book, he has to save his own soul, in the second, his sister's, and now it's a whole new ballgame when the ghost of a little girl keeps begging him for help.  In the first book, he fails to stop the girl from jumping/falling to her death in a successful suicide attempt, a failure which has haunted him from that point onwards.The usual characters (dead, living and otherwise) are back in book three, which sees Nightingale negotiating with a powerful secret organization and some even more powerful supernatural beings, while facing his own personal demons and trying to stay out of prison courtesy of the police force.At a first, second or third glance, Nightingale seems to be completely mad, but by the end you realize that he's as crazy as a fox.Amanda Richards, April 19, 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5QLQOYMSOD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444700707#wasThisHelpful","RO5QLQOYMSOD3","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Professional photographers would generally step up to the 32GB cards, but for the serious hobbyist, this will do just fine.This card will hold more than 4,000 JPEG images at approx 3 MB each, or about 960 RAW images at around 14MB, so there's lots of room for you to take repeated shots of Uncle Carl and Cousin Luke until they get their smiles in sync, or keep shooting that beautiful sunset until the green flash.I have used two of these in a Nikon D7000 for almost a year without a problem or a lost photo.  The 10 speed means that you can shoot continuous sequences without delays, so you'll never miss the kiss after the cake is cut, or the cute moment on the swing as your child soars in the air.Two tips to note are that your memory card will last longer and perform better if you delete your photos using the computer after you've saved them, rather than trashing them one by one through the camera.  Secondly, format your cards through the camera before each new shoot so you start off fresh and clear each time.  It's also recommended to change your cards after a reasonable period of use, so keep the page bookmarked.Highly recommended for serious hobby or amateur photographers.Amanda Richards, April 19, 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RI3B8TJHWUNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LFVKES#wasThisHelpful","R1RI3B8TJHWUNT","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My other half has been using electric razors (predominantly Norelco) for approximately 20 years, so this review isn't about electric vs. blade as much as Norelco vs. Norelco. With this in mind, this model shaves as well as the Norelco 7810XL, which this current series replaced.To keep this short and to the point, let's just say that it does everything the product description says and I'll simply highlight the good bits (as reported by the resident expert)The slightly redesigned body fits comfortably in the hand. In addition, this version uses a Comfortcut shaving system which feels slightly gentler on the skin than the lift and cut system of the older model. The best feature of the PT720 is the Battery Low/Full indicator. You now have an advance warning system for when the razor is about to conk out, as compared to the old system which often quit unceremoniously with half the job done.The only complaint about this model is the lack of the invaluable pop-up trimmer, which you'll need if you're not in the habit of shaving thisclose. So, if you love you some stubble or just need a little facial pruning, and you need a trimmer then maybe you should consider getting the PT730 instead.Amanda Richards, April 18, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8PTO629P00Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GQYSFA#wasThisHelpful","RA8PTO629P00Y","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It tells the story of a shy tortoise named Kachuva who makes friends with a pair of ducks who invite him to come live with them in the mountains.Naturally, the logistics prove to be challenging as Kachuva has no wings, but the friends come together and find a solution. However, there is a certain condition which is vital to the plan, and it's up to Kachuva to hold up his end of the bargain.The result of their cooperative effort should become a moral for all members of the animal species, once the old storyteller can convince his audience of the authenticity of the story.This is a well told story with colorful and age-appropriate illustrations.

She suddenly realizes that she can now read people's minds, and this throws her into a complete spin.  She eventually discloses this to her father, who lets slip that she's not the only gifted one in the family.She can't believe it when her father asks her to help with an investigation involving a missing girl, but when she gives the police her full cooperation; a can of worms is blown wide open and there's no way those worms can ever get back in.

"Short Attention Span Summary:1. Unbelievably nave college student does her friend a favor by interviewing a young successful business entrepreneur.2. Turns out that he's hot3. She can't believe that he would be attracted to her, but he starts showing up on her home turf4. She is slightly bothered that he has extreme stalker tendencies, but ""Oh My!"" he's hot5. She is bothered by his extravagant gifts, but ""Oh My!"" he's hot6. She rolls her eyes and chews her lip, which make him hot - ""Oh My!""7. He makes her an offer that most people would refuse, and she thinks about it for most of the book8. While thinking about it, she discovers her inner kinky and does the dirty ad nauseum9. He's temperamental, damaged, domineering and a total pain in the tail, but has incredible stamina in the sack, is perfect in every other way, and of course - ""Oh My!"" - he's like, totally hot!10. She sends a lot of e-mail and texts, rolls her eyes, picks at food and drinks rather too much Twinnings tea &/or alcohol, while borrowing clothes from her BFF (as she doesn't seem to have anything decent of her own) and occasionally from other sources.11. The erotica starts off hot and sweaty, but by the time they get to the REALLY freaky stage the reader is too sated to care all that much.12. Everything is left hanging at the end.Initially I was excited about this book and didn't want to put it down, but as it went on it became apparent that the BDSM was the core of the story, and that dialogue and plot and character development were of much lesser importance.  The ""hot and steamy"" was fine, but without believable characters, back story or direction it all became rather repetitive and tiresome and fifty shades of boredom.This is essentially a YA romance turned into a R-rated story with little dialogue adjustment other than the erotica, and would make an extremely shallow movie if they stick to the book.  However I can totally see Ian Somerhalder as Christian Grey, and maybe Mia Wachowski as Anastasia.Steamy in this case turns out to be mostly hot air.Amanda Richards, April 14, 2012","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AH34XVYEPEDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007J4T2G8#wasThisHelpful","R1AH34XVYEPEDF","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this brilliant and inspired twisted tale, the rich-robbing, poor-giving outlaw of Sherwood Forest falls into the legendary role quite by accident after fleeing an arranged marriage.  Escaping a life of household duties and child bearing with a man she loathes, she poses as young man for her own safety and ends up deep in the heart of the forest.A chance meeting and a fatal altercation later, she settles down in a makeshift shelter and prepares for the solitary life of an outlaw. This however does not last forever, and after rescuing a young lad from the Sheriff's men, she finds her herself with company against her wishes.  One thing leads to another, and before she knows it, she's playing host to a hard scrapple band of outlaws and their families, and ironically she's in charge of household affairs and midwifery.Many exciting adventures later, she does much of the stuff that you've read in the original legend, but you won't believe the twists and turns when Marion needs rescuing and ends up in the camp, and hormonal rushes threaten to destroy the Lincoln Green fabric of the band of Merry Men.Readers will thoroughly enjoy the revised roles of the Merry Men, especially Little John and Will Scarlet, and towards the end, even the Friar gets tucked in.Amanda Richards, April 14, 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U2EWKF6PK3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SFN4GI#wasThisHelpful","R16U2EWKF6PK3H","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Caribbean native I can fully appreciate and understand the author's desire to chronicle his early experiences living on the fringe of society.  This poignant, hilarious and candid memoir rings true and hits home hard, and unlike some others in the genre, never comes over as derogatory or offensive.Indeed the language is raw, and the creolese may be befuddling to non-Caribbean readers, but the meaning and sentiment is always conveyed with complete honesty and clarity.  To his immense credit, the author does not try to tie his observances together with a flimsy attempt at a plot, and does not promote his thoughts and experiences as being applicable to all people living on the island. This is the Jamaica that you won't see from your Ocho Rios beach chair.Told as a series of short stories with intermittent poetry, the author covers not only daily life back in the day in the Third World Caribbean, but folklore, promiscuity, family relations, celebrations and politics, among others.  To be honest, I read it in one sitting as I didn't want to put it down.

"Can treasured white vans come back from the grave?  Mma Ramotswe and Grace Makutsi certainly believe it when they catch fleeting glimpses of what appears to be Mma Ramotswe's trusty (now late) van driving through the streets.However, there are cases to be solved, and problems to be resolved, and soon they are taken up with the case of some slaughtered cattle whose owner is seeking justice.  On the home front, Charlie finally does something productive and is trying to outrun his responsibilities, and it's up to Mma Ramotswe to pin him down and work out the best course of action.To add to the strange occurrences of the ghost van and the dead cattle, something much more sinister is afoot when arch-rival Violet Sephotho decides to run for Parliament.  Of course everything gets solved after a little legwork and a lot of tea, and everybody unites for a good old fashioned wedding in the end.This one is a little slower paced than most, but for fans of the series it's just like a familiar and comfortable pair of shoes.Amanda Richards, April 6, 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5EO4DYA3W3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FGMD3M#wasThisHelpful","RH5EO4DYA3W3H","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For us avid followers of this laid back, tea drinking series, this latest (13th) installment brings more of the same, but with a couple of new twists and jolts to keep our interest firmly in check.  It begins with a dream of a tall, well-built man standing in the shade, and follows up with the collision of Mma Ramotswe's detective job with the demands of her friends' personal life crises.For one, her friend Mma Potokwane of the orphanage is distraught over big changes proposed by the board of Directors, which ultimately leads to her dismissal; and for two, one of the mechanics gets into big trouble with the law, and his defense counsel isn't giving them the assurance that he's going to be very helpful.It's not all bad news though, as her dream visitor turns out be someone she respects very deeply, and her Associate and friend Grace Makutsi and her husband Phuti have begun working on their new home.  Unfortunately, good news can turn bad unexpectedly, and it seems that Grace's fundamental dislike of the contractor may not be unfounded.Together with her esteemed visitor, Mma Ramotswe starts turning rocks to see what she can dig up that will be helpful, but gets help from several unexpected quarters in unearthing the truth and putting the various cases to rest.  But there is one last surprise to come.Other than a little (forgivable) rambling about the good old Botswana days, this is an enjoyable ride over bumpy roads.Amanda Richards, April 6, 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DELN2L6D7L1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PRJQ2G#wasThisHelpful","R2DELN2L6D7L1G","A37PV5GMP2ILJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37PV5GMP2ILJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elizabeth Strout's writing reminds readers the 'pain quotidian' is not just sustenance.  It can be satisfying and flavorful too.  My Name Is Lucy Barton is a slim but marvelous slice of family reminiscence that reminds us life unfolds not as a dozen momentous events but as thousands of small, seemingly insignificant ones.  It is clear-eyed in its assessment of parental limitations and unsentimental in its assessment that sibling ties don't necessarily bind.  Each life accumulates its share of hurts, grievances and complaints, that can be indulged or not.  It reminds us to forgive not because of some innate goodness in ourselves but because we will surely require forgiveness in turn.The eponymous protagonist is in a NYC hospital recovering slowly from surgery.  With children too small to visit and a husband too busy she is often alone with both her thoughts and fears.  It is not immediately clear the decision of her husband to fly in her estranged mother for company is necessarily a good one. It is from here though that the novella takes off.  As a look ""back"" at this critical time in her life, we learn not just what Lucy's life was like as a child but what it becomes after that time in the hospital. Illness and death are the great levelers in life but also opportunities--to reassess, to recreate oneself and reassess relationships. Lucy Barton is about learning to be someone who exists not just in relationship to others; a daughter, a mother, a wife.  Lucy Barton is about learning to become a self, and paying a price for doing so.The writing is fine and quite often beautiful.  Strout crafts sentences of simple elegance that are memorable and affecting.  My Name Is Lucy Barton reminds one why we pray for our daily bread.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHSOS1RIUG8U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067693#wasThisHelpful","RHSOS1RIUG8U4","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If written by any other author, reviewers would heap hosannas upon Slade House.  It is clever, intriguing, and simply wonderful on many levels.  As usual, Mitchell is amusing and sympathetic, bending genre and cross-pollinating new works with old characters.  Depending upon your point of view Slade House is either derivative or an extension of David Mitchell's last novel The Bone Clocks.  This will be extremely irritating to fans who have spent the last ten years looking for another Cloud Atas and instead seem to have gotten BC Lite.I reject that criticism of Slade House.  It is neither 'lite' nor derivative.  The story began as a series of tweets about a boy visiting a strange house with his mother.  It built into a short story.  It has become Slade House.  The author who delights us bending genre has done something I think hilariously subversive and wonderful: Mitchell is now writing 'fan fiction' to himself.  The idea is absolutely brilliant and his critics need to get off their high horses and stop whining a story like Slade House lacks intellectual heft.Henry James wrote 'ghost stories', (which at the time of their writing were dismissed by many but now beloved) why not Mitchell? Like James' tales (which weren't scary either--not every ghost story has to be chilling),  Mitchell is plumbing the depths of psychological mystery, not the bloody horror of Carrie.  Finally, the criticism that he might have written something to make money is just stupid.  Presumably his critics chose their professions to make money; are writers any less entitled to pay their mortgage or support their family? Questioning somebody's integrity because one doesn't fully appreciate what an author is attempting is a low blow.That said, Slade House is hardly a perfect work.  The way the book is structured-- 5 chronologically ordered chapters, 50-60 pages each about a character or characters is problematic.  Just when one starts to know or feel connected to an individual, they disappear.  The author might argue his point is we shouldn't have to know humans personally to care about them--a valid point for sure.  The argument doesn't, however,  satisfy the desire of a reader to enter the fictive world of the character.  In that essential way, Slade House is lacking and a bit disappointing.If imperfect, Slade House is still perfectly charming.  Mitchell continues to impress build upon a body of work that now, seven novels on, is really quite dazzling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGBXEC4AQMGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998685#wasThisHelpful","RVGBXEC4AQMGC","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Orphan Master's Son is powerful, searing and beautifully written.  A story that fully imagines life in the miasma that is present day North Korea.  It is also long, at times plodding and relentlessly graphic in its depiction of torture, starvation, and suffering. Each reader's ability to endure descriptions of unremitting misery will of course shape one's final opinion, but I encourage everyone to give this book a try.  It may not be for the feint of heart (or stomach), but it is, in a multitude of ways worth the time and emotional discomfort.Raised the son of an orphan headmaster, Pak Jun Do is not technically at the lowest strata of Korean society but he might as well be.  His mother is gone, his father a drunk and from an early age he metes out the misery that makes a Victorian workhouse seem like a spa by comparison.  Early on the reader understands this will be a tale of endurance-- life a merciless obstacle course.  Army conscript, tunnel digger, kidnapper and radio operator are but a few of the careers Jun Do embarks upon.  None of these, however, are as defining as the stigma of orphan nor are they as tormenting. The quest for self can only be futile because in this world, all individuality is subsumed to worship the Dear Leader.In the People's Democratic Republic, it is understood you will hurt other's or inevitable you will betray friends and family.  The only question is when and how badly.  Propaganda, self-criticism sessions, and voluntary-enforced labor are but a few of the oxymorons that make up this inhuman, surreal existence.  In it, Jun Do can assume another identity, another life that others dare not challenge, unsure if the shift is permanently sanctioned by their Dear Leader.  ""He considered sharing how there was only one penalty, the ultimate one, for questioning reality, how a citizen could fall into great jeopardy for simply noticing that realities had changed.""Once down this dystopic rabbit hole terms like identity and self become meaningless.  It is at this crossroads or denouement that The Orphan Master's Son soars.  The solution becomes letting go of yourself and holding on instead to your humanity.  That part of you that can still care, and love and cherish another despite all the suffering, misery and sorrow.  It is easy to see this book is a tragedy.  It is more difficult but just as true to reregard it as triumph of the human spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RYE8JAAJHI0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812982622#wasThisHelpful","R1RYE8JAAJHI0Z","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American ignorance of soccer continues in this edition of the Best American Sports Writing.  Apparently  none of the best writers thought of soccer, which the rest of the world is mad about and thinks of constantly.  This kind of myopic, old school thinking really detracts from the edition which just seems to be about old farts affirming their assumptions.  Also, one of the reasons to read a collection is for the quality of writing.  This one seems lacking or at least just so-so.Author's like Roger Angell and Wm. Rhoden brings passion and beauty to their descriptions that are largely missing from this collection.  There's an excellent article about pitcher Greg Maddux; a good one about Cowboy coach Jerry Jones and a few tributes to friendship and camaraderie, which seem okay but predictable.

"James Sie has fashioned a very distinct and very affecting tale about coming of age and coming out in of all places, Las Vegas.  It is a novel interspersed with comic illustrations (something I thought I had seen the last of in the 1960s) which I found enormously engaging and sometimes quite moving.  A reminder a picture can be worth a thousand words.  It is a book characterized by great, almost soap-operatic emotional themes.  It succeeds as well as it does because it of a measured, assured writing style that is laced with sardonic wit and great humor.  This is the best send-up of American culture since Confederacy of Dunces.SPOILER ALERT: (though not much of one, since you can glean the following in the first two chapters).  Mom's run off.  Dad's seriously depressed and Walter is very much, NOT on his own, having to parent Dad who can't get out of bed.  It is to the author's great credit that this story doesn't devolve into accusations about parents who didn't take care of their child.  It is a story about damaged people who can hardly (and in some cases not at all) take care of themselves, much less offspring.  It is a small miracle we don't despise Emily, but pity her.  Don't want to slap or shake Owen, but feel compassion for him, and yes, Yes, YES!!! will be cheerleaders on the sidelines rooting Walter on and out to his own life.I was delighted not to know Walter was gay until a third of the way through the book.  A very different kind of ""coming out"" story--one that establishes Walter's bona fides as a person rather than a sexual preference.  Well done.  Not to say sex doesn't matter to 17-year-olds--Sie gives hormones their due with his infatuation with Chrysto and Acacia who are catalysts for his liberation.  Along the way, there are wonderful references to Liberace and accordions, the tackiness of American culture (no not just Las Vegas) and as mentioned earlier, illustrations that are quite evocative and a marvelous addition to the story.  I will not be so dismissive of their value again.Many reviewers have rightly noted that the topics covered are dark and somewhat grim. Very true.  But I found Still Life Las Vegas enormously optimistic--a testament to what human beings can survive, overcome and yes, appreciate.  I found the ending rather pat but that's a small complaint.  This is a terrific story, told with skill and honesty and a first-rate illustrator (NOT cartoonist).Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AXLOAIEQFJDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055660#wasThisHelpful","R1AXLOAIEQFJDO","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sleek is the best one-word description of the Invicta Pro Diver.  The black/steel finish is polished but not garish or shiny.  The face is a nice, legible white contrast and easily readable.  It is though pretty big. If your wrist is thin or the back of your hand small this may not be your best buy. Not everyone wants that much real estate.  Owner's should also know the Prov Diver has some heft to it. I noticed the weight but didn't find it too heavy. Others might disagree.

"I really enjoy Louise Penny's Inspector Gamache series, with a few reservations.Like many mystery writers today, the books are overlong--bloated even. There is, by my count a storyline that has run through three books.  That's a long story. Too long.  Also, her affection for the ""cozy"" aspect of mysteries is completely lost on me. I doubt very much small town life is as sweet (I say saccharine) as proponents would have us believe.  More importantly it creates a distracting cognitive dissonance, hopping back and forth from gritty (bad) urbanity to idyllic (good) rural Three Pines.  Worse, it's morally simplistic and banal.Three Pines is, apparently a liberal paradise full of the quirky and the queer, (in the old and new sense of queer).  Chunky black retired therapists mix with tree-hugging former lumberjacks who have seen the error of their murderous ways, and now do penance crafting ""found"" lumber.  A sort of vegan cabinet maker.  Cranky ""artiste"" types waddle about with pet duck in tow and everyone sips cafe au lait or hot cider with a cinnamon stick.  These and your daily stack of blueberry flapjacks with local artisanal maple syrup (bien sur!) are  served by two sassy queens that own the bistro and B&B. I like my politics liberal and maple syrup too, but please, Louise.  A few less cliches, s'il vous plait.That said, it's probably a small miracle How The Light Gets In is as good as it finally manages to be.  When Penny works through the rehash of back-story and the dross of an addict's desensitized feelings it's pretty great.  There's a nicely imagined parallel mystery of a family of quintuplets that is reminiscent of the once-famous Dionnes.  It's first-rate.  The last quarter, in fact, is gripping, with twists and turns that are both chilling and surprising.  I just wish there had been more of that pace.I quite loved the ending until the last few pages when I realized where Inspector Gamache will be retiring too--no, it's not Boca Raton.  I'm mad enough to kill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOS6PJ4W6RP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUTNIE#wasThisHelpful","R1AOS6PJ4W6RP2","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Louise Penny's The Beautiful Mystery succeeds on many levels.  The mystery is solid and engaging--incidents and events tie together and ""wrap up"" well.  There's no bait and switch or superfluous diversion along the way to 'whodunit?'.  Also, characters are very well drawn and the author has a sharp eye for the moral turpitude and shortcomings of those in religious and secular life.  Division, jealousy and pettiness great and small is rife in both worlds.  Generally, the characters are complex in nature with one important exception.  Armand Gamache is, in my opinion, rather too immaculately conceived, but that is a personal opinion.Best of all there is a trove of interesting musical and historical information. Did you know the Dominican Order (that spearheaded the Inquisition) were the Hounds of the Lord (Domini Canis)?  Now you do. I learned lots about plainchant music, monastic orders and neumes (the predecessors to musical notes).  It's all very well done and my only complaint is that perhaps Ms. Penny provides too much of a good thing.  It seems as though I attended service for each of the seven canonical hours, whose music and liturgy were constantly interrupted or obscured by the crude carping of a rather annoying inspector, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.  I realize he is the street-smart, working-class foil to the esoteric and posh Gamache, but he began to get on my nerves.Last, there is lots and lots of backstory.  It's practically another novel (and was).  This could definitely have been trimmed.  Getting to our denouement began to feel like a Second Coming and I personally couldn't wait to say,  ""Amen!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GO0XQRWCCBHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250031125#wasThisHelpful","R3GO0XQRWCCBHF","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits is a smart, funny roller coaster of a story that shamelessly taps every male adolescent cultural icon of the last 50 years.  Men In Black, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and a host of DC/Marvel heroes and villains provide self-referential fodder and meta subplots any 13, 33 or 63 year old boy will adore. Techno gadgets and mini-cams, talking toilets and slapstick violence (villains literally get their nuts roasted, on more than one occasion) will delight the adolescent in us all.  It will also cause some readers to dismiss Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits as mere self-indulgence. A literary cocktail of testosterone and steroids.  That, I think is a mistake.This is the the story of 22 yearl old Zoey Ashe--trailer trash with a 38 year old stripper mom--who wakes to find herself a billionaires with a a bounty on her head.  Worse still her pursuit and attack is featured on Blink, a live-stream that allows every subscriber to be both cameraman and viewer.  In David Wong's disturbing future you no longer have to go to the Coliseum to watch them feed the lions--the Coliseum comes to you. Reality TV ratcheted up to sadistic indulgence. Zoey's fate plays out in Tabula Ra$a, a futuristic ""new city"", where law and rules no longer apply.  Politicians have capitulated to donor greed and demands,  allowing a capitalistic Free Zone.  The result is a mecca for Immorality and Vice.  The female protagonist with clear-eyed humanity is a key relief valve to the Fancy Suits, offering a counterpoint to predatory maleness that has literally gone amok.Zoey's background and perspective serve as a searing indictment of those in the thrall of mammon or indifferent to the poor.  There's much Ayn Rand garbage spouted and endless examples of corporate abuse and indifference.  It is all refuted by an unaffected manner and goodness of a heroine who refuses to hop on the bandwagon that exploits the weak.  Tucked in among the car chases and explosions is a steady decency serves as the book's moral core.  Amid the giggles and guffaws are just as many pauses Wong forces the reader to make. Think what it means to surrender every vestige of privacy, be indifferent to the weak and adopt the philosophy of Arthur Livingston: ""the market is a machine, if any man is so foolish as to try to stop the works from turning, he not be surprised when he gets ground up in its gears.""The book is not without flaws.  A single fart is funny.  A dozen gross (no pun intended).  There is entirely too much ""deus ex machina"", particularly toward the end.  These however, are small complaints.  Very funny and sometimes hilarious is how people will initially describe Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits.  Upon reflection they will add...and very disturbing.  A terrific read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUBTK8WP1Z2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040191#wasThisHelpful","R1GUBTK8WP1Z2J","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One hundred pages into John Banville's The Blue Guitar, our narrator and protagonist exclaims: ""Damn it, here's another digression: there must surely be something or somewhere I don't want to get to...."" It's called the point Oliver. A place your creator seems loathe to visit as well.  It is a peculiar talent that makes a 250 page book a slog, but a talent Mr. Banville possesses in abundance.  This is especially ironic because the author is a prose master capable of crafting sentences of breathtaking beauty.  Unfortunately he is incapable of creating characters anyone would care for or about.Or perhaps his characters are intended to be a counterpoint to the gorgeous prose: dressage for donkeys.  Oliver Otway Orme is surely the opposite of stunning and more than a bit of a jackass. Self-abosorbed, Self important and Self satisfied with so little Self-awareness. Oliver is the perfect embodiment of condescending artiste.  A smug, stylized exterior is the tiresome veneer concealing  even more tiresome inadequacies.  As Orme nattered and meandered on endlessly about his failed aspirations or failed relationships I found myself muttering ""who cares?, who cares?"" an Om Mantra that seems to be on the tip of the tongue whenever one encounters a Banville character on the page.The author is renowned for sardonic wit but I thought The Blue Guitar oddly humorless.  The one laugh-out-loud moment is certainly unintended. When Polly professes to Olly she's madly in love with him I guffawed.  For all the wrong reasons.  Rather like being madly in love with a poinsettia.  Whatever for, Polly?  Equally droll is the observation: ""All we have are surfaces, surfaces and the self's puny interiority; that's a fact too often and too easily forgotten...Au contraire, Oliver.  You're memorably puny.Orme/Banville's facility in French is typically pointless and irksome--noses are not upturned, they are 'retrousser on dit' and if you refer to a scarf as a foulard it's ever so artistic. Let's not wonder why a painter circa 2015 wants to gad about his hometown playing the part of Maurice Chevalier in Gigi.  The story is typically self-referential (the artist as kleptomaniac though seemed rather trite).  Other references to the distortion of objects and objectification more nuanced.  Lots of metafictional allusions JB admirers will absolutely coo over and there's a double betrayal that's mildly interesting. Ollie's wife Gloria saved me from complete disengagement. An intriguing enigma among a vapid lot.Glorious prose and Gloria gloriana weren't enough for me though.  Neither could put a polish on the dullness that is The Blue Guitar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKPK0WRPEWV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354266#wasThisHelpful","RBKPK0WRPEWV9","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Imagine a sequel to Little Women that tells us Jo March is running a brothel. Or Catcher In The Rye’s Holden Caulfield is a Nobel Laureate.  That is something like the sense of utter bewilderment one experiences while reading Go Set A Watchman, the novel that was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, but is set after Mockingbird’s events. [Several critics now doubt the publisher’s timeline saying it was intended as a sequel, but I don’t think that much matters].  The most important question is a good novel? Honestly, I didn’t think it was.If the Atticus Finch of Mockingbird was too paradigmatic, the Atticus Finch of Watchman is too far a pendulum swing in the other direction.  Apparently nuance is not Ms. Lee’s strong suit.  20 years after a heartfelt defense of Tom Robinson an American icon is apparently happy to be on the wrong side of Pettis Bridge, rooting for Bull Connor and his dogs.  Atticus has devolved into a state’s righter with a KKK POV.  I have no problem with moral complexity; I do have a problem with implausibility. Either version is possible, but not both (imagine Himmler going on to help Jews settle Palestine and you have something akin to the disconnect).Furthermore, the depiction of the grown up Scout (refashioned as Jean Louise) is disappointing. There are moments of Lee’s signature voice, but the very premise of the book feels contrived.  If To Kill A Mockingbird was a ‘coming of age’ story for her and brother Jem, apparently in the South one must do so twice--disabused of paternal admiration.  Home two years earlier for her brother’s funeral, Jean Louise is entirely too unaware of her father’s real beliefs, entirely too disillusioned.  Apparently Atticus has been the Atticus of Watchmen at least since the New Deal.  It just escaped her daughter’s notice or she excused it.Apparently Jean Louise’s goal was to move to NY and become the least observant writer in America.  Unlike many I was not upset with the notion of chipping away at the Atticus Finch pedestal.  Personally I prefer a hero with warts, and Atticus is entirely too saintly for my taste.  But Go Set a Watchman isn’t a course or character correction.  It’s a political tract that is so ham handed as to be implausible.  Sadly, all it does is diminish my estimation of a much loved author.  Perhaps that’s not a bad thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JHAJ8U0LWO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3DNKIE#wasThisHelpful","R27JHAJ8U0LWO2","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first heard about Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between The World and Me I criticized it (and the author) to a friend wondering what kind of father writes  a book to a teenage son (the rhetorical answer being a bad one) admonishing their child to never believe in the aspirational narrative of the American Dream. ""Read the book"" I was told. Now that I have, I see my criticism as unfair and offensive.  The rhetoric is powerful and the argument informed.  The writing is beautiful and the intent quite loving. It is hard to do better for one's child--but tragic it needs to be written.Not since William Rhoden's Forty Million Dollar Slaves has their been a book about race quite so provocative and harsh in its condemnation of those who buy into the American Dream.  The two authors approach it from different angles, I think perhaps for generational reasons but I really can't know.  To Rhoden the Michael Jordan's of the world were sell-outs bartering their dignity and souls for a modern version of slavery.  To Coates Dreamers are deceived or deluded: nobody at the bottom (and all blacks are 'bottom') is ever precious to those who call themselves white. At best they are props or exceptions that prove the rule that all blacks are fuel or fodder; grist in the mill that keeps the Dreamer atop our social heap.  If their bodies can no longer be legally enslaved, black bodies--usually teenage sons-- are with relentless regularity ""broken""  by whites or those who serve them.  The American Dream for black citizens is a dystopia.Coates uses the tradition of the slave narrative (Frederick Douglass' and Solomon Northrup's come immediately to mind) to tell a powerful story of an individual's physical, intellectual and emotional journey as a black man in America.  From Western Baltimore to Howard University, NYC, and Paris Coates struggles to give discover an identity, then to debunk it, and then to refashion (quite brilliantly I thought) not as a series of truths but as a series of questions that are inherently mistrustful of Truth (particularly with a capital T).  He most emphatically will not let Dreamers or those black believers in the Dream off the hook--and blame the black victims of violence.  Trayvon Martin, Prince Jones, Michael Brown, Eric Garner et al., did nothing to deserve their deaths, and their deaths were not unfortunate: they were murdered.A handful of quotes:  --60 percent of all young black men who drop out of high school will go to jail.  This should disgrace the country.  But does not...  --'Bodies were broken. People were enslaved.  We meant well.  We tried our best.' ""Good intention"" is a hall pass through history, a sleeping pill that ensures the Dream.  --the Dream is just and noble, and real, and you are crazy for seeing the corruption and smelling the sulphur.  For their innocence they nullify youranger....and you find yourself inveighing against yourself.  --and the Dreamers are quoting Martin Luther King and exulting nonviolence for the weak and the biggest guns for the strong.Upon finishing The World And Me I found myself almost reflexively dismissing or beginning the process of refutation that would exonerate me or be mitigating factors.  And then I stopped.  I decided to just sit with Ta-Nehisi Coates' ideas and opinions for a while.  To think about them.  A few hours.  A few days.  I'm not sure how long.  To let them percolate awhile and to simmer.  I hope many many others will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R824VGD1C24X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993543#wasThisHelpful","R824VGD1C24X5","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a sucker for sappy mother/daughter stories, add a star.  In fact, add 10.  The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs by Matthew Dicks is perfect for you.  Repressed (to the point of emotionally stunted) good mom Caroline drops the F-bomb on a bad mom at school.  Bad mom's obnoxious behavior stirs memories. The ground shakes beneath and more memories stir.  It positively quakes for her 15 year old daughter, next day at school, stirring retaliation. There's a veritable bouillabaisse of things stirred and events putting other wheels in motion. Before you can say ""do you kiss your husband with that potty mouth?"" mother and daughter are on the road to confront mom's past. Following is some synopsis but no spoilers:The premise of the book sounds worse in outline than it actually is in the telling--at least initially.  There is some deft observation about how passive and shy people fly under the radar; parent/kid angst and alienation, some people lack the confidence to tap into their talent.  Unfortunately this is all tied back to simplistic, single causation and makes our protagonist entirely too one-dimensional.  Caroline is more a type than an individual, so wimpy as to be deserving of her offspring's disdain as well as a swift kick in the rear.  Daughter Polly (at a time when girls are called Madison, Addison and Peyton, who tags their kid Polly?) is my least favorite type of teenager--smart and sassy; worldly and more in tune with her emotions than the parent.  In other words, truly obnoxious.After the deft observations of early chapters the author unfortunately strays into hokey, schmaltzy and odd.  When Caroline arrives at her destination she notices that ""Emily had become a woman that puts mint in lemonade.""  I'm guessing that's a deplorable sort of woman but I'm not really sure why.  Sometimes I mash some raspberries in mine, Matthew Dicks.  Hate me.  Anyway, it takes far too long in a very brief tale to get to the point. Daughter Polly has to intercede again, like one of those sitcom kids who make their parents do what's best. Polly's Nana Penelope is now engaged and our ""Lifetime: Television for Women"" script is firing on all cylinders.  Before the big denoument there are detours that comment on an unhappy marriage and yet another childhood trauma.  Caroline apparently was the Antigone of 9th grade. Even the author has nemesis Emily muse: ""It's kind of unbelievable we're standing here in the cafeteria again.  Considering the circumstances. It is indeed--unbelievable is the perfect word for the last 50 pages or so.  Cue violin music, tears of sorrow, tears of joy.  Closure at last.The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs is far from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRU0ZSK7D0T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006309#wasThisHelpful","RWRU0ZSK7D0T3","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How Winter Began is a collection of stories and vignettes (more about this description further on) that reminded me of Virginia Woolf's autobiographical essay about woman writers and the need for women to create a feminine/feminist cannon.  To tell their own story for its worth but also to serve as a counterpoint to the lives and experiences expounded in a patriarchal literary tradition.  It's fair to say Joy Castro would passionately agree.  Her writing is so emphatically female in orientation and feminist in perspective she no doubt will be pigeon holed by some, diminished by others, which is too bad.  It is oxymoronically true there is much for men to connect to in the author's mostly feminine point of view.As with all collections, there is an unevenness that is to be expected--no reader is going to enjoy two dozen different stories equally.  I found the writer's penchant for ""vignettes"" more problematic--both frustrating and occasionally actually annoying.  There are approximately half dozen two or three page ""incidents"" that seem to me more scene than story, a snippet recounted and then abruptly ended.  More akin to a writing exercise than an actual story.  I found them to be more of a tease than a tale.  Others will no doubt disagree.There's a panoply of rather predictable types--single mom's, Latinas, liberal academics, English teachers and wives, but the stories are far from expected.  A number are quite affecting--a cri de coeur (I don't know the Spanish idiom) that resonates long after you have finished your reading.  That resonance and impact is of course the hallmark of fine writing and what makes How Winter Began so very worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q66U7N0IDYGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803276605#wasThisHelpful","R2Q66U7N0IDYGX","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In fairness to the author of The Hummingbird, I have just been reading two brilliant writers--Owen Sheers and Edward St. Aubyn.  Both are very tough acts to follow, and Stephen Kiernan doesn't impress as being in the first rank of writers.  His novel, the story of hospice caregiver Deborah Birch is riddled with cliches and cornball characterization.  Nurse Deb Birch is the Full Mary Sue: sensitive, wise, and intuitive.  Where others might think patient distress is related to pain, Deb has a ""hunch"" a former patient Neil just needed his morphine lowered enough to express the dying wish to mow a neglected field. Upon completion, he can hop back in bed and die in peace.  You go girl!  A colleague even more saccharine than Deb (she must be toxic) encourages a dying patient's family to circle the bed, hold hands and sing ""you are my sunshine.""  Now in my 7th decade, I probably should look into alternatives to hospice care.Apparently she is (if she does say so herself) the benchmark of hospice providers,  held in reserve for the toughest of cases.  In this instance it's a retired history professor named Reed serving the roll of misanthrope, who deep down isn't so bad after all.  If only we all had the patience to have dishes of applesauce thrown at us and then comment:  ""he'd won my heart already.  The crusty old coot.""  As Deb and the old crusty coot get on, the cliches become a downpour:  When she discovered she couldn't have kids she ""wept as though I were teaching the sky to rain.""  Fortunately hubby Michael assures her they can make enough joy together for a whole family.  The flickers of a smile and the twinkle of eye start to pile up.  Once happily  married to ""a powerful, generous, patient, breathtaking lover,"" he is now unhappily,  retuned from war and--irony of ironies--Oregon's best caregiver can't seem to help the person she cares for most.  A third into the book I wouldn't have minded a little morphine myself. Nor would I have wanted Deb to have a hunch that lowered my dose.With writing this hackneyed one anticipates a predictable plot, and the book mostly delivers upon reader expectations.  The story of Deborah and Michael, caregiver and PTSD sufferer is unimaginative and develops ponderously with, of course, time spent with ""the old coot"" shedding invaluable light upon her own problems.  What keeps the book from being a real stinker is a subplot of a book written by her patient about an actual Japanese pilot, Ichiro Soga, and his activity during and after WWII in the Pacific Northwest.  It is by far the most interesting part of the novel. The numerous insights into Japanese culture are engaging and there is a theme of reconciliation and acceptance that is rather well done.  At the end, I learned the author is a former journalist.  Those skills are on full display in the historical chapters, and frankly I wish they had been expanded upon.  Without them The Hummingbird is a bit of a dud.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMYI54BU8485/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062369547#wasThisHelpful","RLMYI54BU8485","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sam Tannehaus' provocative title (but not so provocative thesis) is that the conservatism of Burke and Buckley is dead. In the last generation conservatives have made a devil's pact with Christian kooks and America First global interventionists.  The movement has not only lost its mooring but is listing in the shoals of racism and jingoism.  Frankly, anyone who has watched a Republican convention since 1980 could have deduced the same but Tannenhaus does us the service of organizing this into a thin, cogent volume.To return to its roots (if not its glory days) he suggests the movement in general and Republican Party in particularly returns to the Burkean faction trumpeted by advocates such as W.F. Buckley for more than half of the last century.  Sound advice if politicians were interested in principle over power however experience shows us otherwise.  The notion that 10s of millions of supporters are going to be turned away by the GOP is simply preposterous.  Nice explication of the problem.

"Wilfred Owen's searing anti war poem has a counterpoint in Owen Seers' beautifully complex and engaging Resistance. Neither is a fan of Horace's concluding observation:  ""est pro patria mori...""  The Great War's greatest literary antagonist chronicled the grinding physical degradation and relentless waste of life war imposes. Owen's poem had the courage to pull back the curtain that had fallen over soldiers' suffering--blunted by nationalistic propaganda-- in a tribute to the dead or wounded that amounted to an aesthetic howl of rage.  Nearly a hundred years later another poet, Owen Sheers chronicles the emotional and mental suffering of those on the home front who are literally and figuratively abandoned by their husbands. Men more attuned to Ovid's blandishments and government palaver than to their families' needs and suffering.Sheers imagines a Britain being invaded in a counterattack when the Allies' own Normandy incursion fails miserably.  Four days after a successful German landing 7 men--fathers and husbands--leave their families in the middle of the night to join the Resistance.  It is a planned desertion--in the works for years had it become necessary. It also completely blindsides the wives and women they are supposed to care for and love.  Sarah, Maggie and five neighbors are left to shift for themselves--without warning and most importantly without understanding why the oaths made to them mean less than an oath to government intelligence services.Seers is a masterful writer--beautiful, and poetic description is one of the hallmarks of the author's writing which can do equal justice to a beautiful landscape, a filthy soldier, a terrified housewife.  As with his most recent work, (I Saw A Man--also superb) there are no simple, easy answers.  The morality of this story is complex and to some extent unfathomable as every action seems fraught with positive and negative consequences.  Sarah and George their neighbor Maggie and the Wehrmacht Captain Albrecht who comes to occupy a small, Welsh valley, are all beautifully depicted.  Old, young, male, female, British, German: each is, as Maggie would say, knocked down from the pedestal of their illusions.  All are in the midst of a free fall.  It is only to be determined how hard the landing will be.When a freak winter snow storm seals the occupied and occupiers inside the valley, new attitudes develop, new relationships form.  It is wonderfully well done spectacularly equivocal and therefore seemingly honest. Some reviewers have been dismissive of the stories plausibility--unable to fathom an occupation of Britain.  I say if Roosevelt and Churchill could imagine the triumph of Fascism, so too should we try.  Other reviewers are no fans of ambiguity.  That's fine.  I like boiled potatoes too.  However, anyone who relishes complex flavors; savory as well as sour (there's not lots of sweet in here) will enjoy reflecting upon the provocative questions it asks:  how much loyalty is too much to ask? How much is owed to country, to loved ones and to our selves?I finished the book over a weekend. The slow, languorous pace, the  beautiful prose and challenging morality were nothing less than hypnotic.  As Willifred Owen exposed the physical toll exacted by war, Owen Sheers reveals the mental and emotional strain inflicted upon not only those who fight and are desperate for a respite, but also upon those that are  left behind to ask ""what for?""  Resisitance is a  terrific accomplishment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BP7KAK8JJJMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013TPYOE#wasThisHelpful","R1BP7KAK8JJJMJ","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why Our Children Will Be Atheists is a bit of a fraud, and as a committed atheist I couldn't be more disappointed.  Instead of buckling down and substantiating his provocative thesis with facts or persuasive research Williams dithers for HALF the length of the book presenting what is effect a workmanlike overview of World Religion.  Thanks, Albert but I've taken that class....get to the point. And therein lies Albert's problem.  Why our children will be atheists is based entirely upon the notion that rationality and intellect will triumph over superstition and ignorance.  At times I thought we lived on an entirely different planet.What Atheists does well (in that absurdly long overview of theism) is discuss how derivative and how viciously violent the major world religions happen to be.  All too true but since when has the human race been so appalled by violence as to renounce it?  Indeed, the whole 20th century and the first part of this one seem to indicate we're dedicated to fine tuning our ability to kill.  Williams also seems to rely entirely too much upon (no pun intended) ""the better Angels of our nature.""  The notion that the ignorant and superstitious will suddenly have the scales fall from their eyes, or that multi-media and the internet is a match for the dedicated brutality of Shia or Wahabi narrow-mindedness is a lie.  It has been 35 years since the Iranian Revolution and the imams shows no sign of losing power.  Iraq is torn asunder with religious strife; Wahbism is regnant on the Arabian peninsula and we bogged ourselves down in Afghanistan for a decade to replace religious radicals with a drug cartel. Huzzah!!!After devoting more than half the length of his argument to a World Religion Intro Williams then spends another lengthy chapter arguing religions have an unfair advantage in schools, government support and social standing.  Dude, you are preaching to the choir.  We know the influence is pervasive--how and why is it going to die out I thought was the point of this far too long, off topic book.  Apparently it could have been a magazine article. Eventually the author gets to the point that education, media and virtual connectivity will diminish its advantage.  Thin gruel if you ask me.  95% of Americans are functionally literate and 90% believe in some diety or another.  Fundamental christians and bores again are pervasive and influential throughout our political system.  One can't teach Darwinism in half of our public schools.  Mazel tov Saudi women shaking off your shackles.The great strength of course of religious ignoramuses is a willingness to strap a bomb about themselves, push the button and expect to have a hundred virgins waiting for them in heaven.  Rationalist who KNOW there is ONLY this existence are far less eager to depart it.  It's hard to trump that.  Further, atheism is a world view acquired by education and reflection.  It is not a passion or prejudice I believe needs to be rammed down others' throats. Every atheist I know has wasted tens of hours of discussion with idiots who have NO counterargument to your points (don't even know what evidence actually is) but look at you dreamily and tell you it's their FAITH that guides them.It is impossible to counter such imbecility and since atheism is NOT a righteous path,  I am quite happy to allow the ignorant to wallow in their ignorance providing it is not imposed upon me. I will do my part to defend rationalism and science among family and friends but is the point of being non religious to NOT prosteltize.  Frankly, atheism is less formidable than religion because it DOES require education, reflection and the (initially) disturbing idea that this life IS all there is.  I am happy to wrestle with these difficult issues but if others wish to cop out I'm not counting on the worldwide web to overthrow god or  disprove the ""comfort"" of religion; the ""bliss"" of ignorance.  An oxymoron need not be untrue.I wish Albert's thesis held more promise, but I have lived in this world long enough to know the stupid and superstitious have a pretty good grip on it.  I don't begrudge him my $.99.  If you're looking for an overview of the topic this book is a bargain. I do begrudge him the 5 or 6 hours of my time he wasted as I waited for him to get to the point, he never really made.

"Heather Graham seems to have (successfully) created her own genre: paranormal romantic suspense.  What will they think of next? Nothing, I hope. This book is just awful. My rule of thumb--if you can't identify a single interesting or redeeming quality about a book in the first 50 pages, chuck it.  It doesn't deserve any more attention than it has already been given.  I am confident in saying I could have read 5 times 50 pages and still have nothing good to say about The Silenced.  NOTE:  The paragraphs below contain story lines from the first two ghastly chapters.  To anyone who thinks the revelation of cliches might SPOIL their enjoyment, consider this your ALERT.Like so many at the bottom of the suspense genre barrel,  the author is addicted to both cliche and exclamation points! They seem to be on every page! together!  ""Get out of Washington! It's a nest of vipers!"" or, ""It was just a suspicion and it could be unfounded!"" or ""...personal danger hadn't even occurred to her!""  and my personal favorite: ""Anyone in politics was suffering from a mental disorder!"" [guffaw].  This is the first five pages.  The problem of course is it's not so bad as to be funny.  Just appalling.  The author apparently forgets her previous paragraph: ""She needed somewhere far, far, away from DC.""  One paragraph later: ""Baltimore?""  Apparently Ms. Graham can't follow the thread of her own writing or she flunked geography, blithely  unaware of the two cities' proximity.But there's worse. A serial killer who names himself, of all things, Slash.  The victim Lara, luckily has a BFF Meg JUST graduated from the FBI academy (top of her class) and MIGHT be invited to the special paranormal unit (you read that right, dude) Krewe Hunters--a 21st century variation of GhostBusters.  Matt Bosworth (who speaks to the dead, but wisely rarely tells his superiors) is a Studly Doright and heart-throb waiting in the wings for dear Meg (who's worked really hard, remember).  I've nicknamed Mr. Bosworth,  Dash.  Thought it would be fun to have a Dash chase a Slash...but I digress.  Some old fogies find corpses may (or my not) be communicating with them ""before the light went out"" and the whole Motley Krewe is headed up by a part Native American named Jackson who makes incredibly racist observations such as his heritage has been ""sadly diluted,"" apparently by white folk.It is a testament to the government's ability to flush hundreds of millions of tax dollars down a toilet that I briefly considered this krewe of punters might exist.  The back book jacket promises a connection between Slash, political conspiracy and paranormal activity in (of all places) Gettysburg. Talk about desecrating national monuments (exclamation point).  It's The Trifecta Of Summer Trash with a splash--or is it Dash?-- of romance between the beefcake agent and dear sweet Meg.  How do I know if I haven't ready more than the first two chapters?  I am banking on the author's affinity for cliche.I have struggled mightily to think of single positive thing to say about the first 70 or so pages of The Silenced.  I have come up with only this: my copy was free.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6EZ02HHTXHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317994#wasThisHelpful","RP6EZ02HHTXHF","A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XC6NAEF7RKZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This case is amazing considering that I got it for less than $6. And even with the price tag aside, the case is awesome quality! It's just as nice as some super expensive ones I've seen! VERY thin, pretty durable, and fits PERFECTLY. I bought this case so I could cover it with stickers instead of putting stickers on my Mac...but I don't know if I want to since the case is so nice looking by itself! Plus this was the only shiny hard case I could find. All the others are rubberized. I would totally recommend this product.Also, If you have the 2013 model, it fits fine but it covers the microphones on the left hand side. I just drilled two tiny holes for them so if you want a super cheap case that looks awesome and you're willing to do a little modification...you can't beat this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E83AB3GGB4NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SZ0F52#wasThisHelpful","R3E83AB3GGB4NP","A2T8JRVJRVNX8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T8JRVJRVNX8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:-Looks great both with and without your phone attached-Phone connects very sturdily in any configuration-Keeps phones out of your face when looking out the windshield-No need to stick anything to your windshield or dashboard-No chance of this thing falling down while drivingCons:-If you have a foam lining in your CD slot, this (very noticeably) leaves a whole bunch of lines in the foam that will never go away. If you never plan on removing this mount, or you just don't care about damaging the cosmetics of your head unit, this won't be a problem.-While I am sure this will not fall out of the CD player, it is pretty wobbly once inserted. My concern is not that it will fall, but I'm hoping this won't eventually damage the CD player after a few months of jiggling and wiggling around.4/5. Overall, I will never use another type of mount.

"Superb audio quality. Whenever reviewing a set of speakers, you ALWAYS have to keep the price in mind. Even if there is minor sound improvements that could be made, I strictly compare to what is already out there for this price. As for these speakers, I would pick them over ANY option in this price range. Even if you could find a similar setup for a bit more money, I can guarantee they won't look nearly as beautiful as these. With price, style, quality, and (most importantly) sound quality taken into consideration...these are my top recommendation.

"Pros:-Battery is good enough to fully charge your iPhone-Kickstand comes in handy-Very slim for a battery case-Uses the iPhone lightning cable to charge (this was the major selling point for me)-Easy to use one button functionality. Makes it easy to start and stop charging.-Very clean looking battery gauge tells you how much juice is left in the case-Looks AMAZING on the iPhone 5s-The rubberized plastic material feels great in the hand-Does not cause a haze when taking a picture with flash on in the darkCons:-Cutouts are a bit uncomfortable to use. The ones for volume aren't too bad, but the one by the sleep/wake is too deep, but you kinda just get used to it. It actually doesn't really fit the phone perfectly at the top. The case is like a millimeter too long.-It does muffle the iPhone's speakers just a little bit. Not too bad, but noticeable.-No lay on the table design so the screen isn't protected at all from drops. I personally don't care at all and I actually think it makes it look better, but some people could see that as a con.-You cannot use anything besides the apple earbuds while this case is on.

"Is it INDESTRUCTIBLE?  noCan it cook you BREAKFAST?  noHow about fixing a flat tire, can it do that? noWhat about walking your dog?  nopeTaxes?  no, it can not do your taxes either  :(Can you fill it full of molten lava, close the lid then jump off a 50 story building and not spill a drop or leak?  absolutely not.Why did I give it 5 stars then if it can not do any of the above mentioned typical uses for a travel mug?Because it looks better than the photo, it holds tea, coffee, etc and keeps it cool or hot a reasonable amount of time, the lid works great by not allowing it to splash out of the cup when I am carrying it out to my car and it is a big cup that fits in my cup holder and i can drink out of it (the cup not the cup holder).Some of these reviewers expect some crazy things from their cups but for me this is a really nice one and it functions as any normal person would expect it to.  It is a double wall GLASS cup that is not bulletproof, it can not survive being hit by a baseball bat or from being thrown onto concrete.  It will leak if you fill it up, close the lid then hold it upside down while shaking it.  BUT when does the average person ever need a cup to do those things?  I guess I just must be boring.Great cup, GREAT looking (much better than the photos) and it works great at holding liquids (but not lava) and it holds the temps well (but not for months or years)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HSFQR90CYFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXO7WPS#wasThisHelpful","R9HSFQR90CYFV","A2FUD7TNC8HRYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FUD7TNC8HRYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always go back to Asics.  Recently I had bought a pair of K-Swiss Tubes and thought they were great but slowly I started to develop some foot problems because of them.  My big toe was hurting so bad I thought I had arthritis and the side of my foot started hurting as well.  After a few months I was walking with a limp.  I finally figured out it was the shoes when I put on my old pair of asics and wore them for a few days then the problems started to go away.  I ordered these since I have almost flat feet and knowing asics normally fit true to size for me I ordered the 2e wide and went a size bigger to 15 (yeah i have giant feet).  They are about 1/2 a size big on me (i assume where they are wide) but they do not slip at all and they are super comfortable so I am keeping them.  Now that I have wore them for a few weeks my foot is doing great and I no longer think about my feet all day and all night which means they are doing their job.  I am sticking with Asics from now on.  I have worn them on and off for 20 years and every time I have tried something new it has not worked out for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXOZPYT85NIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D874TSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LXOZPYT85NIX","A2FUD7TNC8HRYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FUD7TNC8HRYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I spend a lot of time cruising around late at night, especially at greyhound bus stops and dark alleys.  I have found the Back Seat Air Mattress to be a must have item to keep with me at all times.  I keep it in what I like to call my cruising kit (Back Seat Air Mattress, duct tape, rope, hatchet, bleach, shovel).One of the many features of the Back Seat Air Mattress that I love most is the easy clean up if me and a messy friend or a nice lady that needs a ride standing on a street corner late at night happens to get something on the air mattress when she asks to take a nap or something.  I can hose it off at a car wash and wipe it down with bleach and an old rag then BAM! it is good as new with no messy DNA left behind or umm ketchup or other condiments....yeah that's it.To conclude, I find the air bed bedroom aka back seat air mattress a must have for daily activities that may tucker you out or if you meet someone sleepy that needs a ride and a quick nap.

It is also a chore to scroll through all the menus and the alarm is not loud enough compared to the Lad Weather watch.

The barometer also only shows data from the last 12 hours, the lad weather watch shows it for the past 36 hours.I love pulsar/seiko watches but i was surprised that i liked the lad weather watch better.

"The sizing is slightly small, I measured at the knee 15"" and the medium states it fits up to 16"".  I can wear it comfortably but I doubt a leg that measures 16"" could.

It works much better than I expected and it is very comfortable and my leg does not sweat at all with it on so the ventilation is great.

"Fits about 1/2 to 1 size too small but appears to be very well made. I normally buy Asics because of the high quality, extremely consistent sizing and comfort. Asics is a shoe I can order online, no matter what model and know that a size 13 is an actual size 13.  It is very frustrating ordering clothes and shoes online only to discover how inconsistent most manufacturers are with their sizing.  A medium in one brand fits like an xl or xs in another.  Or a size 13 shoe in one brand fits like an 11 in another.  Imagine how much profits would soar from the huge reduction in returns if manufacturers were consistent in their sizing.Back to the shoes, they are well made, good support for high arches, neutral fit and have very good padding.  HOWEVER, I wear a size 13 and my toe was touching the tip of the shoe so they fit small.  What a disappointment having to box these right back up and ship them back. If they had fit I think they would have been a very good shoe for long distances.  Back to Asics for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLJPMEBGWINY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B106NG#wasThisHelpful","RGLJPMEBGWINY","A2FUD7TNC8HRYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FUD7TNC8HRYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing full, rich audio from a bluetooth headset!  My friend had bragged about his Audition headset for weeks, I finally talked him into allowing me to test them over labor day weekend and I was simply blown away at the comfort and performance of these.  He also owns a pair of their motorcycle headsets which work very well so I was excited to try out the noise isolation headset to see how they would compare and I was not disappointed!I would rate the comfort level a 10 out of 10, I have a medium-large head (typically I wear a medium to large in motorcycle helmets) and the Audition headset fit me perfectly.  My gf wears a small and she was able to adjust these to fit her head as well so these should fit a large range of head sizes.  The range from the connected device also scored a 10 out of 10, I was able to walk through the house and the headset had no issues maintaining connection through walls.  Volume levels are more than sufficient, even while I was mowing the lawn the headset was able to easily isolate the sound of the riding mower and still provide me with a rich full range sound.  I found these especially nice while watching TV in bed, I did not experience any external bleed-through of sound which would disturb anyone in the room.  The battery life is amazing, I did not charge the headset the entire 3 days I used them.  My friend stated he can easily go 2 weeks without charging them which is astounding.At the end of the weekend I was reluctant to give back the headset. I would have loved to do further testing for my video review blog but unfortunately I was having too much fun using them to spend any time during the 3 days to perform any ""official"" testing lol.I can not imagine finding a better headset for under $150, these are fantastic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXW61B1FN032/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J95SC5M#wasThisHelpful","R3AXW61B1FN032","A2FUD7TNC8HRYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FUD7TNC8HRYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well made unit with one speaker.  Avantree appears to have excellent customer service and their products overall appear to be well thought out and an excellent buy for their price point.  My friend has a set of the Avantree BTHS-HM100-A headsets on his helmets and I connected them to my Sena SMH-10 headsets when we went on a motorcycle trip this summer.  The Avantree headsets worked well with a good range, the noise control while riding was good but not as effective as the Sena which was expected.  We traded helmets for a day and I found the volume level to be good for only having one speaker and the battery life would last for a day of riding with moderate use.  Compared directly to my Sena headsets which were nearly $300 the Avantree's held up well.  I would love to test a set of their newest model which should perform better with dual speakers.Overall:* Very good battery life* Moderate volume levels sufficient for speeds of 60mph or lower (used with a modular helmet)*  Excellent build quality*  Held up well through a heavy rainstorm with no issues*  No problems pairing with a Sena using the universal bluetooth connection mode","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DF5ZHITR3PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B9AM4G#wasThisHelpful","R17DF5ZHITR3PM","A2FUD7TNC8HRYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FUD7TNC8HRYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Wi-Fi extender increases the range in our house to reach the outlier spots that were about 10-15 feet outside our modem's range.  We have the extender about 15 feet from our modem.  It seems to add a delay to pulling up websites on Apple devices, but that is the only problem with its functionality.It set up easily with one exception:  I interpreted the start-up guide to read that the password for the system is ""admin.""  That password is for the online settings website not the Wi-Fi network.  I had to chat with customer service rep for a while before he or she mentioned that the password is the same as my home network password.  Why not put that in the start up guide?

"Although it is a good translation, I disagree with the translator James Clark’s assertion that Henry Suso is saint in the “fullest and best sense of the word” and is the “best antidote for soul-destroying materialism.”  While Suso was a devoted Christian and servant of God, his self-tortuous practice and reliance on mystical visions sets him apart from what we consider Christian orthodoxy today.  On the other hand, Suso’s pursuit of Eternal Wisdom and passionate commitment to Christlikeness above all else set an example of sacrificial discipleship.  Suso articulates his approach to the Christian life in the following quote:“He who hopes to overcome a pampered, rebellious body by gentleness, lacks common sense.  He who would have the world and yet serve God perfectly, strives to do the impossible and will falsify God’s teachings themselves.  Therefore, if thou art minded to renounce the world, do it to some purpose.”The above quote certainly offers a rebuke to our consumerist Christian practices today.  Unfortunately, Suso’s oppression of his body and voluntary suffering included extreme physical self-abuse and neglect.  He also counseled his devotees to engage in lesser but similar self-abuse.  As I read his story, I was equally astonished at his passion for Christ’s service and his distorted practices of following Christ.In the midst of his unseemly practices, he served Christ by serving others.  He also shares many mystical visions he experienced of angels, Jesus’ mother Mary and Christians who had passed into their eternal rest.  He was guided by the expressions and messages of these visions by which he also gained encouragement through his trials.Suso confesses that for many years he suffered under depression and anxiety due to his lack of assurance of salvation.  This led to severe mortifications of his flesh until he discerned God commanding him to stop.  Suso also attributes sicknesses to God’s Providence and form of discipline.  During one vision, he perceived that an angel told him that “God had ordained the sickness for thee for the best of reasons.”The book reveals the Medieval Roman Catholic mindset regarding purgatory.  For example, Suso is chastised by a vision of a friend of his who had died because Suso did not say Mass’s for him to release him from purgatory.  After performing Mass for the friend, the friend is apparently helped at once from purgatory.Life of a Servant is a look at the Christian life of a 14th century friar and mystic.  It is enlightening to know of Henry Suso’s devotional life, his passion for Christ, his service to others and poverty.  It is also revealing of the pre-Reformational teachings about salvation, forgiveness, suffering and purgatory.  Overall, I am impressed by the sacrificial life of service, distressed by the self-abuse and thankful for the Protestant Reformation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUAGKG7DA5JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718893433#wasThisHelpful","R2OUAGKG7DA5JS","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Travis Mills' story highlights the tough character of an all-American young man.  Mills seems to have grown up as an around good guy who excelled in sports, loved his family, friends and his country.  After high school, he was inspired to join the US Army and the 82nd Airborne Division where he continued to excel as a soldier and leader.  He fought bravely for his country and brothers-in-arms.Sadly Mills was injured by an IED and became a quadruple amputee.  He has accepted the challenge of overcoming his injury and not letting it get the best of him.  He has conquered great obstacles in his rehab and recovery.This is a well-written story that conveys the real person who is driven and determined to win while also maintaining an indefatigable sense of humor and compassion for others.  I believe that this book illustrates what is the best and worst of humanity.  Mills opens his heart and life to readers without an malice, resentment or despair.  Readers can develop their own opinion of the absolute evil we are fighting in groups like the Taliban.  Likewise, readers can discern that our current politicians have sent our best and brightest to fight with their hands tied behind their back.During Mills' third deployment when he was injured, he and his troops were ordered not to attack Taliban forces as they planted IED's in our troops' path.  Our forces, we learn, could not fire upon enemy combatants unless first fired upon.  This means they had to sit and watch Taliban plant IED's or drive to places of ambushes without doing anything about it.  Undoubtedly, this has led to many soldiers being injured.  Mills, however, has a great attitude through it all.  His story conveys how bravely are soldiers are fighting for their country.Readers cannot help but be proud and inspired by his accomplishments post-injury.  You will also be amazed and inspired by the many who have come along side him to help.  Amazing medics and hospital staff, therapists, family, friends and charitable groups and individuals have contributed in incredible ways to Mills' recovery.  His wife and family have come through as heroes, too.This is a great country, and Travis Mills continues to be one or our best and brightest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CY7PO4AVXKIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110190478X#wasThisHelpful","R2CY7PO4AVXKIJ","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Rev. Dr. De Arteaga has provided a tremendous resource to Christians through the research, devotion and faithfulness displayed in this book.  He uses the life and ministry of Agnes Sanford to anchor a book on the history of the ministry of healing, deliverance and spiritual gifts through the history of Christianity.  As he asserts, one cannot read the New Testament without making the obvious conclusion that the ministry of healing and deliverance are central to the gospel proclamation of Jesus and the church.  De Arteaga strives to restore this ministry to the central role it should have in theology, Biblical interpretation, worship and Christian mission.Beginning with the early church, the author follows the ebbs and flows of spiritual gifts to the present time.  He highlights a resurgence of the healing ministry that grew out of what he terms the ""Marcion Shove"" of the New Thought movement of the last century.  This culminates in Agnes Sanford's ministry that contributed to the Charismatic Renewal of the 60's and 70's among mainstream church in America.  In examining Sanford's ministry, the book reveals the patterns of the healing and deliverance ministries -- the challenges and the sacrifices involved along with rewards and fruitfulness.The writing displays the author's in-depth study of the topic and his vast research in the areas addressed.  In addition to much reading, first hand and second hand accounts contribute heavily to the picture painted of Sanford's life and ministry.  The ministry of the Holy Spirit through the manifestation of spiritual gifts has clearly been a vocational calling and passion of the author.  He has presented the wide and substantive scope of the topic in this book.  De Arteaga acknowledges the opposition and arguments against the charismatic ministries.  He addresses the belief and practice of cessationism head-on, and I think shines a light on the fatal flaws in it.  He discusses the objections or distortions that serve to quench the Spirit and undermine effective ministry.Technically, the book is well written and organized with myriad references and supportive materials.  I believe this book will certainly compel the reader to pursue a fruitful ministry empowered by the Holy Spirit's gifts.  Through the reading of the book, readers will learn how to pray for healing and some of the techniques that Agnes Sanford and others developed to facilitate healing prayers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8OAXX6CXM9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625649991#wasThisHelpful","R2M8OAXX6CXM9G","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel is a decent ""paperback"" novel that provides some entertaining suspense.  There is nothing deep or complex here; it is a story geared toward readers who want a stimulating tale without much investment required.  The plot follows the search for a young woman by her FBI agent friend and her new male partner.  The plot also involves the search for a serial killer that may also be involved in the death of a US Congressman.  The FBI agents work for a special unit whose agents possess special abilities to see or hear ghosts and who use special intuitive powers to solve cases.The murders of a few young women are grisly but the author does not get too graphic on the events or the aftermath.  The violence is juxtaposed with the romance that buds between the two agents -- who of course are both beautiful and sexy.  The novel borders on being a sci-fi/fantasy/romance but never quite crosses the line fully from being semi-realistic.It does provide entertainment but is ultimately unsatisfying due to the superficiality of the writing, plot and characters.  As one reviewer commented, it is an okay ""beach read.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9CIP735TYXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317994#wasThisHelpful","RS9CIP735TYXJ","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seifrid’s commentary on Second Corinthians fulfills the aims of the PNTC series to “make clear the text of Scripture” for “serious pastors and teachers of the Bible.”  This commentary demonstrates thorough and objective scholarship.  Seifrid fully exposits the text while presenting a deeply devotional reading of the letter.  Rarely does a Biblical Commentary satisfy academic inquests and inspire faithful, deeply reflective meditation on Scripture.  By practicing robust exegesis true to proper biblical theology, the author has produced a valuable commentary for any earnest students of Scripture.The commentary approaches Scripture as God’s word and this letter as written by Paul, as he was inspired by the Holy Spirit.  Seifrid addresses critical objections to both of these assertions including the various fragmental theories of the letter’s authorship.  This book serves as a welcome challenge to critical approaches that differ.This commentary has a rightful place in seminary libraries and pastors’ studies; however, it is not the type of commentary that facilitates a quick reference of a verse here or there.  Seifrid counts on readers investing time to read through the text of this book.  He writes the commentary verse-by-verse in paragraph style.  He sometimes spends several pages on a particular verse. Readers will find it worthwhile to read this book from beginning to end. Readers will gain insight into all of the topics relevant to a clearer understanding of the letter; likewise, readers will obtain a better grasp of the Christian faith.  I think the following statement shines a light on the author’s approach to his work.  He elaborates on Paul’s understanding of the good work of intercessory prayer.  Seifrid writes, “Our labors and prayers are nothing more than a participation in God’s work in the world, which remains God’s work and not our own.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35CNM4CBM5V7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802837395#wasThisHelpful","R35CNM4CBM5V7X","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"McGoey goes into significant detail to demonstrate the ins and outs of large foundations and their positive and negative effects.  While concentrating often on the Gates Foundation, she explores the history of foundations and how they have evolved to be influential players in many areas of domestic and international aid, politics, business and stature.  Throughout the book, the author seems to be seeking the answer to the question of whether foundations mostly benefit the poor or the providers and their own agendas and stature.  The answers seem to create a mixed bag of results and perceptions.  There are no doubts that those behind the large foundations wield considerable power and influence that can be used for good and bad, altruistic and self-serving purposes.McGoey really zeroes in on some particular areas of aid such as health provisions and agricultural help internationally to see the intricacies of how the lines between altruism and self-serving promotion are not so easily determined.  She also explores the backgrounds of how some of the larger foundations came to exist -- for example through less than ethical business practices.  The book paints a picture of the enormous wealth of the wealthiest 1% and how foundations serve their own purposes.  Again, the focus is largely on Bill Gates and his story of amassing a fortune and giving away a lesser but significant fortune.In the end, readers will have a better understanding of the role foundations play and will be able to make a more educated analysis of how they fit into our economy and social system.  I think what we learn is what the author quotes from one of the opportunists she discusses, ""Generosity can be very profitable.""  The book highlights how the wealthy use foundations to protect huge slush funds of wealth to be used beneficially according to their definition of beneficial.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARW4PS96XJBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784780839#wasThisHelpful","R2ARW4PS96XJBF","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The adjustable and break-away strap is super -- very easy to size and then to remove and put on. Best of all, these do not leak!! No water in the eyes at all.

"Steve Topak writes with verve and doesn’t hold punches as he shares the gleanings of his experience in corporate environments.  Topak seems to have packed about 100 years of experience into his 30 year career.  His book is resourceful and effective in providing leadership guidance.  I think it would be useful to readers at all stages of their careers but especially to those starting out and hoping to climb the ladder or initiate a business.Topak offers real-world, off-the-streets writing on leadership that at times encompasses all things vocational and relational.  The book comes in at about 280 pages.  I kept waiting to get to the part of the book where Topak would become redundant and superfluous so that I could start skimming to the end.  That point never came.  He keeps offering insightful and challenging writing throughout the book.  Some readers may find the book too broad and wish it was more focused and precise.The author sets the tone right out of the gate in the introduction.  Topak writes, “You can’t fix a problem until you identify it.  And the only way any of you are going to become the innovators and business leaders of a new generation is fi someone has the guts to tell you the truth, get you off the Kool-Aid you’ve been drinking, and set you on the right path.”Topak works through the rest of the book to make that happen.  I actually used the above quote in a recent sermon (I am an Anglican priest), because it made me stop and wonder, “What Kool-Aid am I drinking from someone else or from myself?” and “What truth do I need to hear?” Before continuing the sermon, by the way, I had to explain to half the congregation the meaning behind the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid.”  Google “Jim Jones and Jonestown” if you are unfamiliar with its origins.Topak is invested in shining a light on many of the myths we are buying into regarding leadership and developing our careers and productivity.  In this day and age, “when everyone is a focus group of one” we buy into our own narcissism and especially to the hoopla of personal branding, social media and projecting an image.  Topak contrasts these with actually forming ourselves into leaders through hard work and experience, innovation, study and developing something to offer to others rather than creating an image or brand so that it looks like we are valuable.  Here is something Topak writes that many of us probably need to hear, “The vast majority of what you do online is not only a complete waste of time, but it’s also keeping you from doing what really matters—what will enable you to someday become a successful entrepreneur and business leader.”Throughout the book, Topak references case studies of businesses and leaders for good and bad.  He shows that not only does he have significance experience but also is well researched and studied in terms of the business world.  His career involved the technology field, and many of his examples but not all come from that arena.  These are interesting and insightful.  Readers learn a good bit about many of the “celebrity” CEO’s in today’s business world.  He uses many of these examples to demonstrate what it really means to be a leader and entrepreneur.From his own career, Topak discusses successes and failures, risks that worked out and decisions and were wrong.  He provides good guidance about how to handle the ups and downs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2512A8X6X1MK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159918575X#wasThisHelpful","R2512A8X6X1MK7","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son and I have completed a few Halo projects as well as several large Lego projects.  This is a great concept and can make a playful model for young boys; however, there is nothing worse than difficult instructions and illustrations, 600 pieces all jumbled together, missing pieces and pieces left over.  That is what we discovered with this tank project.  When it came to the last few pages, pieces were missing.  Fortunately, we have a trove of Lego pieces to dig through to find what we needed.  Then, as you can see by one of the pictures below, a handful of pieces are left over.We went through the instructions methodically and then back again when it didn't come together at the end.  The cannon piece that fits on top of the tank body was really frustrating.  The illustrations are difficult to determine exactly where pieces go, and in this case exact placement is vital.  Either I read it wrong a dozen times or the design instructions are faulty because based on instructions, it didn't quite fit.  I had to move things around to make it work.When it comes to a project like this, as you probably know, a few wrong instructions, a missing piece here and there (or a broken wheel axle and no extra like we had happen) can derail the fun of the project.  Finally, the 600 pieces come in about 8 bags with no rhyme or reason to their packaging.  I saw no option except dumping them all on the table and digging through them for each section.  How much more trouble would it be for the manufacturer to group pieces together by section.  It would be so much more helpful to users to work with one group of pieces at a time, and then they wouldn't be spread all over the table which my wife loved.I would call this a missed opportunity by Halo.  We still have a working tank that my son is enjoying, and we learned the lessons of overcoming challenges.  Unfortunately, the pieces are not very secure and easily fall apart when the tank is played with.  The gun barrel is especially loose.  I ended up super gluing the pieces of it together.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEMSGVIL8GSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U26LIXU#wasThisHelpful","R1CEMSGVIL8GSZ","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While providing some helpful historical contexts to the first century, Armstrong approaches the Apostle Paul's life with much skepticism and subjectivity.  She clearly esteems the intellectualism and ""scholarship"" of the last century over and against the traditions and beliefs that faithful Christians have held for 2,000 years.  She asserts as facts what are unsubstantiated criticisms against church traditions regarding Scripture and Paul's life.  Readers should be aware that her primary reference for the life of Jesus and the interpretation of the gospels is the unorthodox and critic John Dominic Crossan.  He is a modern critic of Scripture who rejects any supernatural element of the Christian story including the resurrection of Jesus.  Armstrong shares his assertion that the gospels and the book of Acts are nothing more than creative fiction that use some real characters to develop a false narrative.  Likewise, she holds that several of the epistles credited to Paul are fraudulent early 2nd century innovations.  In stating her unorthodox approaches, she asserts them as facts shared by ""scholars.""  Yet, these claims are unsubstantiated except by modern source criticism and speculation.  Many scholars hold to the traditional beliefs that were prevalent since the time of Christ.Therefore, her view of Paul is skewed by skepticism and cynicism.  She makes many suggestions about his life, thoughts and practices based on her own presuppositions that reject any thought that the Scripture and Christian beliefs might be true.  The Holy Spirit doesn't exist in Armstrong's treatment of Paul.  His mindset and teachings are based on sects, conflicts, control and general religious experiences that he imagined or developed along with the other folks in the Jesus movement who conspired to create this whole thing we call Christianity.While rejecting the very real influence of the Holy Spirit, Armstrong's explanations of the ""Jesus movement's"" success are simply vacuous. The complexities of this alternative view proposed by Armstrong undermine the substance of it reasonableness.  Her attempts to hang its verity on modern scholarship hold no merit.  As one Biblical scholar writes, the view shared by Armstrong ""rests precariously on a web of unproved assumptions that are rarely acknowledged.""  For her, anything other than the Christian teaching is believed as an unambiguous fact.  The book is full of contradictions.  For example, on one hand, she asserts that Jesus' message was ""politically explosive;"" while, on the next page she states that there was ""nothing novel"" about Jesus' teaching.Armstrong rejects the traditional views on Paul's authorship of several letters of the New Testament.  She states as a fact that scholars have concluded that only 7 of the 13 letters attributed to Paul actually are his writings.  It would have been honest to qualify what scholars and their presuppositions and to state that very many scholars disagree with her.  Then she creates a fictional account of later writers who penned letters in Paul's name to ""rein Paul in and make his radical teachings more acceptable.""  This is entirely arrogant speculation in contrast to what the early church taught and passed on.Similarly, she makes the statement that the second letter to the Corinthians ""in fact"" consists in five separate fragments from Paul and one insertion by an anonymous writer.  She presents this as irrefutable; however, this is not an accepted fact among Biblical scholars, as she asserts.  Mark Seigrid, in his recently publish commentary on Second Corinthians writes, ""The notion that a letter that was instrumental in cementing the bond between the church and the apostles would be subject to a scissors-and-past operation, even at a later time, is difficult to imagine.  The burden of proof surely lies upon any theory of a composite letter.""  Of course, there is no proof besides skeptically informed source criticism of the 20th century.  Her assumption that the early church was deceived by a pseudo-anonymous author of the pastoral letters to include them in the canon of Scripture is similarly unsubstantiated by anything but presumptuous source criticism biased against plain, apparent authorship as indicated by the letters.  So, her entire vision of Paul is skewed by a truncated collection of his writings and an arrogant rejection of Acts as reliable history which leaves her to fill in the gaps with imaginative historical fiction and presumptions.Armstrong discounts the main thrust of Christian teachings on various topics.  She relates Paul's concept of sin to ""instinctual reptilian drives"" in our brains rather than the depravity that humans possess as a result of a fall or sinful nature.  The fall and the redemptive-salvation history conveyed in Scripture comes under her category of ""legendary material.""  Much of the historical events of Paul's life discussed in the book are qualified with phrases like ""this may or may not be true.""  Of course, in her mind such a phrase must describe everything Paul tells us about Jesus, because Paul is responsible for the ""gradually altered"" figure of Jesus as compared to the real, ""historical Jesus"" who ""never really interested [Paul] in the first place according to Armstrong.  This demonstrates Armstrong's fallacy of knowing the mind of Paul better than others over the last 2,000 years.Armstrong's high esteem for her own view inspires her to correct Luther and other figures of the Reformation.  According to her, Luther et al misinterpreted Paul's writings in Romans and Galatians on ""justification by faith.""  Paul was rather developing a Jesus cult in contrast to the cult of the emperor.  Armstrong also incorrectly insists on correcting sacramentalists like Roman Catholics on the proper interpretation of Paul's writings on the Eucharist in 1 Corinthians 11.  It would seem she is only imitating what she accuses Luke of doing in his book of Acts in which she claims he consistently put his own imaginative words in Paul's mouth to convey what he thought Paul should have said.  This is the reason why she literally warns readers that ""Acts must be approached with caution.""Perhaps the most confusing claim by the author is her conclusion that ""Paul's radicalism was utopian.""  What?  The Apostle Paul ""utopian?"" There is nothing ideal about his teachings or vision or practices.  Even his vision of heaven is weighted by his mourning that his brother and sister Jews might be lost due to rejection of the Messiah Jesus.  He, more than anyone except Christ, has a clear view of the evil and suffering associated with life in this world.

"In Forgotten Power, the Rev. Dr. William De Arteaga proves his study and experience of Christian revivals.  His book is well written and enlightening for readers interested in learning about how God has worked to bring revival among his people.  The book highlights Biblical revivals from the Old and New Testaments, historical revivals and contemporary revivals.I appreciated the research that went into drawing out from church history the contexts of the revivals from the Reformation to the charismatic renewal of recent times.  De Arteaga accesses firsthand accounts of the revivals from memoirs, letters, historical books and interviews when possible.  De Arteaga has visited more contemporary revivals to give his own eye witness account.A focus of the book is the role of Holy Communion in the revivals; however, the book covers a variety of revivals and looks objectively at the presence or lack of presence of Communion.  De Arteaga is not critically negative of those revivals that have neglected Communion for one reason or another; rather, he analyzes the positives and negatives of all of the revivals and their fruit.De Arteaga impressively examines the Weslyean revivals in depth while comparing and contrasting them with others.  He does delve into the theology and practices of the various revivals as well as the support and opposition that occurred.  He emphasizes the long term benefits or lack of them for the impact of the revivals.Overall, this is an incredibly helpful book for those praying and working for revival today.  Readers can see how this study prepared the author for his next book Quenching the Spirit.  In this current book, he identifies roadblocks to revivals that must be overcome to sustain the Spirit's work.  He also identifies antinomianism as a danger when church focus too much on the manifesting signs of the Spirit to the neglect of holiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TAVYWULLCXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310245672#wasThisHelpful","R19TAVYWULLCXH","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beyond Engagement takes readers beyond the superficial, apparent leadership techniques to the deep heart of employees and followers where the resources of energy and productivity lie often untapped.  Brady Wilson exposes reasons why so many attempts to motivate, incentivize or reward employees seems to fail.  Even programs with the best intentions may fall flat.  Wilson shows that leaders need to interact with their followers in order to lay hold of underlying needs and emotions.  Once these are discovered and addressed properly, energy is released and creative productivity happens.Although Wilson conveys the brain and heart science of what motivates and rewards people, this isn’t “brain surgery;” his lessons and assertions are simple yet profound in how they can change dynamics and help everyone involved.  To gain the benefits of the lessons of the book, leaders and managers will have to commit to interacting with their employees on personal levels rather than keeping an arm's length.In a well organized and easily accessible book, Wilson lays out the science behind new techniques to replace old, tired models.  He shows why old tricks have not worked and how to adjust.  Each principle has a case story to substantiate the lesson.  In the process, Wilson offers interesting reasons why the principle exists.  Readers discover enlightening facts about human behavior that are transferable to the workplace.Wilson's approach is simple but not necessarily easy.  He identifies the three main threats to any productivity and to all things good in general: narcissism, individualism and consumerism.  He offers the only antidote for all three as ""sacrifice.""  He suggests that apart from sacrifice there is no sustainable solution for the planet...or our workplace problems.  The key he points out is how to make the right, worthwhile sacrifices.The book won’t take long to read and offers readers sure rewards.I received this book at a discount or no cost in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNAJ3L8WCI12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1772360171#wasThisHelpful","R3QNAJ3L8WCI12","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drone Command follows Troy Pearce, CEO of Pearce Systems, and expert of all kinds of drones that are always at the ready to destroy the enemy or save the planet.  With him in his exploits, is former President Margaret Myers who still wields exceptional persuasion as a power broker.  This time the conflict boils between China and Japan with the USA on the verge of entering WWIII.In this book, Maden continues to prove his political astuteness and technical drone awareness.  The story is choppy and moves from place to place.  Each context is introduced by time and place stamps.  Trying to keep track of the people, places and ships or missiles became tiresome which is why there is a huge list of characters and acronyms at the beginning of the book.  I think Maden takes short cuts in really developing the characters and story in this book.  He does flashback every few chapters to Pearce's teen and college years to give some background to his life.As the book progresses, the suspense builds slightly, as the story reaches a climax and we wonder how the tension will resolve.  This is not a long novel.  Maden seems to have gone for a quick read rather than develop an epic story that lays all the groundwork and character development.

"This fruit and nut bar tastes super.  I love the taste and have to exercise self-control not to eat half the box at once.  I love the combination of chocolate, nuts and fruit.  One reason for the sweet taste is the sugar content of the bar.  Although not as sugary or as unbeneficial as a traditional ""candy"" bar, this treat leans toward the ""candy"" side of the spectrum more than to the ""protein"" side of the spectrum when it comes to bars.  The emphasis in the title of ""Fruit and Nut"" may cause people to think this is a healthy choice for a snack.  Based on the content, I don't think that is the case.  The high sugar to protein/fiber ratio makes this a snack that is not too bad and tastes really good.  It is telling that the Amazon page does not list or show the image of the percentages of fiber, fat, sugar and protein.  It seems perhaps they are trying to market this is a healthier bar than it is.

"If you are interested in purchasing a heavy-duty home carpet / rug cleaner, I recommend this Bissell.  I have used the spot cleaners in the past that are helpful for pet accidents and stains; however, this is a good cleaner for entire carpets and rugs.  It offers two modes -- deep clean and express clean.This is about a quarter to half the size of a professional carpet cleaner and about the same size of one that you might rent to DIY.  It is heavy unlike your typical vacuum cleaner.  Bissell recommends going straight forward the length of the carpet and then straight back the length of the carpet.  After doing two rooms in our house, I was worn out with a bit of a back ache.If you have pets or kids and are repeatedly calling the carpet cleaner, I think this is a better solution and will save you money.  Bissell has an assortment of cleaners for the machine.  I suggest buying a few of the appropriate cleaners when you purchase this machine, because the two bottles that come with it will last only one or two full home cleanings.The cleaner is easy to set up and easy to use and maintain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYEC5PMVF4H8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","RYEC5PMVF4H8A","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Emotionally Healthy Leader presents a culmination of Scazzero's experience developing ""Emotionally Healthy Spirituality (EHS)."" In this book, he designs it specifically for leaders.  EHS seems like a tremendous resource for Christians and especially leaders.  The substance of it is to focus on one's body, soul and spirit in order to bring them in line with Christ's image for us.  EHS sets our personal relationship with Jesus, our spouse and family ahead of anything we might ""do"" for Jesus.  Spiritual disciplines and intentional time management are key to EHS in general.The content of this book is all good.  I consider it all useful and necessary for leaders to lead according to Christ's model and purpose.  The problem with this book is that it cover four distinct topics that I think each require a separate book.  Instead, this book has too much information that is too poorly organized.  The main topics I perceived are personal devotion, personal inner healing, marriage / singleness, and church leadership.  Tackling all of these as intensely as Scazzero suggests would be exhausting for readers.  Each of these requires real work and focus.  Scazzero includes self-assessments for each chapter in the book, but I think it is trying to assess too many areas for readers.  Based on the readability and cogency of the book, I would rate it less, but it is all good content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139ZTPRGPYP2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310494575#wasThisHelpful","R139ZTPRGPYP2E","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful watch -- both the band and the face are exquisitely designed.  As for functionality, it is simple in its telling of time, date and day of the week.  The traditional second hand also serves as a timer in conjunction with the smaller left side timer that keeps track of minutes up to 30.  The time zone indicators can be helpful to indicate the current time of major cities; although, the text is very small and difficult to read if not seen at a good angle.In the hand, the watch feels heavy, and I thought for sure it would weigh down my arm once on my wrist; however, I do not notice anymore weight than with light watches.  The face of this watch is thicker than watches I have previously work.  I am concerned about scrapping it or banging it on walls, doors, etc, because of its width.  After getting the watch band shortened for free at a local jeweler, it fits snugly and nicely on my wrist.  I considered adjusting the length myself, but after watching the jeweler doing it with the unique equipment and skill I believe that was the right decision.  It only took a few minutes to get it just right.I believe this is an appealing watch for its appearance and use.  Its sturdy quality and water resistance also makes it good for outdoor activities.  I have received many compliments on this watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAIBETH31MBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XOQFHM#wasThisHelpful","RZAIBETH31MBK","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bow and arrow weapon shoots rubber pointed arrows with precision and power.  It shoots as strong as any nerf weapon I have used.  The rubber pointed arrows do not have the traditional nerf (soft & squishy or fuzzy) end; they have a rubbery ball shaped tip that causes them to bounce off of their target.  The bow shoots hard, so I told my son that this is an outside toy only and not to shoot it at someone.the device that holds the arrows is cumbersome and difficult to load fully without the arrows falling out. This is the flaw of this product; it surely could have been worked out better to hold the arrows more securely.

"Ken Burger demonstrates his ability to write stories in this novel that consists of eloquent, descriptive language and colorful Southern characters.  Swallow Savannah digs up the bones of the South's dark history of oppression and corruption.  Burger does not hold back when it comes to depraved characters and tragic events.  In the sense of writing skill and dark characters and events, this book matches Southern novelist Pat Conroy who endorses this book on its cover.  Although not as long as Conroy's epic novels, Swallow Savannah shares some of the same elements that make the books enjoyable but also painful to read.Readers are confronted with downright evil characters who create mayhem and tragedies in their wake while treating South Caroline as their fiefdom.  In some ways, the book is an indictment on the corrupt, painful history of South Carolina, as if Burger is lashing out at the state.  However, he artfully sets the story in the context of beautiful, creative writing that carries readers along despite the horror.As readers move along in the story, it becomes more and more of a page turner leading to a climactic conclusion that finally reveals whether the bad guys will get the vengeance coming to them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0ALM7EZD3LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981873529#wasThisHelpful","R1I0ALM7EZD3LM","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Fabulous photographic portrait of Pope Francis.  The photographs in this book are simply spectacular.  The color, vividness, scenes and format bring to life the ministry of Pope Francis.  The text offers a brief glimpse of Francis' biography from a youngster to priest and eventually Pope.  Then the book details a year in the life of Pope Francis, as he leads the Roman Catholic Church through the Liturgical Seasons and Feast Days.I delved into this book immediately and could not take my eyes from it until I scanned every picture.  It is a tribute not only to Pope Francis but to the entire body of Christ and the Lord Jesus himself.  We see Pope Francis as a true servant to Christ and his character and devotion are revealed through the photographer's lens.I believe that any devoted Christian would appreciate this book and be blessed by it.

"Fall From Grace is an impressive novel about the mysterious inhabitants of the heavenly realms.  Ritchie has created what I consider a top-notch novel exploring lives of angelic beings.  The novel excels on the levels of entertainment, writing, story and plot and character development.  I am an Anglican priest and student of the Bible and what Christians call ""spiritual warfare.""  I have read a good bit of books on the topic of angels and demons -- not to mention studying Milton's Paradise Lost and Regained as an English Major in college.  I was thoroughly appreciative of Ritchie's treatment of the angelic realm in his book.  His character development is on par with Milton's angelic characters and C.S. Lewis' characters in The Screwtape Letters as well as more recent novels This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness by Frank Piretti.  Ritchie's character of Satan reveals the depraved glory of the prince of demons, and his character Michael shows the loyalty and heartbrokenness of the faithful servant of God.Ritchie's story is neither necessarily Biblical or unbiblical; it is congruent with Biblical revelations regarding angels while also limited in what the story covers.  It is not a Christian novel; however, I recommend it to Christians who I think will find it appealing and enlightening.  I am pleased that this is Volume I in a series, because it leaves much to explore in future books.  Mankind plays an indirect role in this story and remains on the outskirts of the drama, even though their creation is a significant issue among the angels' conflicts.  Ritchie's imaginative speculation of heaven and the angels' lives is splendid.  There are areas that I believe might be close to the reality I imagine among angels. Other areas that I write off as only fiction are creative and intriguing nevertheless.  I enjoyed reading this as story and reflected on the possibilities for reality as I understand such things based on a faithful appreciation of Scripture.I think the writing on the moral, spiritual, physical and relational deterioration of the fallen angels is where Ritchie really hits the mark.  He seems to capture very well the pride and destruction that flows from Satan to a major contingency of rebellious followers. Readers see the atrocious evil in the heart and mind of Satan and his followers that resembles the spectrum of evil we see in our world.  Ritchie seems to be answering the question of ""How could such a glorious being with such high standing fall so disastrously low?""I will be interested to see how Ritchie follows up this story in future volumes.  He has proven his novelist skills completely in Fall From Grace, and I hope he can extend the story to a proper series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2W4F0PAYRQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502973863#wasThisHelpful","R3A2W4F0PAYRQ3","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Navy SEAL officers Jocko Willink and Leif Babin take readers into the battlefield of Iraq in Ramadi, Anbar Province, where fierce fighting occurred in 2006-2007.  The goal of the book goes beyond war writing to culling their experience in SEAL leadership for principles that be applied to the business arena.  The concept they promote is Extreme Ownership -- this is the leadership theme that runs through their book.The book offers excellent writing that essentially puts readers in the battlespace of Iraq, as the authors develop each leadership principle by showing it in action.  This is some of the best battlefield writing I have read.  They do about a good a job as I can imagine describing and verbally illustrating the scenes and scenarios they experienced.  They were officers leading Navy SEALS that included the unit of ""American Sniper"" Chris Kyle. If you saw the movie American Sniper, that is the context of their battles.After each episode of SEAL training or battle scenarios, they highlight the leadership principle and explain it.  Then they elaborate on it through a case study from their interactions with businesses.  It sounds like the authors have already had considerable experiences working with major companies as leadership consultants.  It also sounds like they have experienced success and effectiveness in the business field, as they did in the battlefield.  If I was a CEO looking for leadership help, I would turn to these men.Extreme Ownership is relevant and applicable to any reader seeking to develop leadership qualities in any field.  None of the principles are irrelevant to anyone in any situation, except the coach potato.  Navy SEALS must be some of the best leaders and soldiers in the world.  Their skills are battletested and proven.  The authors bring into the ""normal"" world and apply it to leadership.  I am extremely glad that this is a great book on leadership...I have to say I would be leery of writing a critical review of two retired Navy SEALS.The only caveat with this book to take into account is that the battlefield writing takes you there mentally.  It is difficult to stay focused on the leadership issue when you are reading about the horror of the nadir of the Iraq conflict with truly evil insurgents who did horrible things.  Then it can be difficult not to begin thinking about the whole big picture of Iraq, past and present.  It is a case when their is a danger that the anecdote or story used to make a point becomes bigger than and overshadows the point.  These authors along with all who fought with them and fight today are true heroes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D1ADPF38BGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067057#wasThisHelpful","R1D1ADPF38BGQ","A11B61QBGHLQDN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11B61QBGHLQDN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wearing this bracelet for about a week.  I usually notice the effects of carpal tunnel pain during my weekly bike ride when I ride for about an hour and a half on a road bike.  That was my test for whether this bracelet helps.  My wrist usually hurts and is tight soon after I begin riding; however, after wearing this and no other changes, I noticed an obvious improvement in wrist pain while cycling.  This confirms the lack of soreness during the week, as I have tested it with stretching exercises.  I also played golf with no pain (I took it off while playing).  The bracelet is attractive, so I'm not worried about having to explain its appearance.  I've been wearing it the entire week except during golf.

"So, ok, this is a pretty basic game. You take bean bags, stand at a distance, toss them vaguely in the direction of the boards, and if you're lucky, they end up in the hole. One point for each time it lands inside, and a half-point for when it lands on the light colored part of the board (this I decree, and it shall be so).As I said, a fairly basic game, but very fun to play. And these particular boards make it easy. They're quite sturdy, made of good, solid wood, with quick and easy assembly. The bags themselves appear to be very durable, and I suspect this whole set will last for decades.Further, it's very portable. The two boards pin together and have rope handles you can use to carry them around. I really liked that idea.

"First impressions:-Look and feel extremely clean-Stretch a LOT on first tuning, but once you get them where they should be, they stay intonated pretty well from the get-go.-well packaged; not too much extra stuff to deal with, clearly labeled in separate envelopesPROS:-sound great in all ranges; high range bright and crisp, low end is warm and full, without being muddy.-B string has excellent sustain compared to Ernie Ball Slinkys (my previous strings); coupled with the dense wood and neck-through construction of the Schecter Stiletto Studio 5 I'm testing on, the B rang long enough to create feedback.  If you have never heard feedback off of a note that low, it is a unique experience.-Play styles:  -pick: crisp tone; the strings are so responsive that if you are not careful, you will get more pick-noise than you  are used to.  -fingerstyle: these strings actually FEEL good, especially under my fretting fingers.  Clean sound, nice full overtones. The responsiveness of the strings is a plus here; the effort required to create the same sounds you are used to is minimal.  I'm not working as hard to play things like the bridge of ""Bullet in Head,"" for instance.  -slap: I am not the most accomplished at this style, but these strings helped a lot.  The same responsiveness that serves so well with finger playing helps one economize finger and hand movements, making faster and more controlled playing much easier.CONS:-I am testing the light gauge set, and they have much less tension than other light gauge strings.  They deflect a LOT more than I am used to.  It's not too much of an issue on the lower octave of the neck, but above the 12th fret, if you aren't careful, you can end up bending notes you don't intend to.-obviously, the MSRPCONCLUSIONSI believe the lower tension might be the reason these strings are so responsive, so it is definitely worth the trouble.  I've been playing these strings for a little over a week, and I'm barely having trouble with the inadvertent note bending.  These strings are far and away the best I have ever used; I bought a new fretless bass a few days ago, but I can't seem to put down my Schecter, and it's entirely because of these strings.  Elixirs are well worth the asking price, and the discounts you get on Amazon make them the best option out there.

"One of the movies I was most looking forward to this year was Avengers: Age of Ultron. It was a decent movie. A solid B. A better film than the first one, but less entertaining.The other big summer blockbuster I was looking forward to was Mad Max: Fury Road. It’s odd, because I have never seen the original movies (despite growing up in the 1980s), and it didn’t seem like one of those sorts of films that I’d be at all interested in. Then I saw the trailer. After seeing that, I thought, “This looks likely to be stupid as all get out, but entertaining as heck,” and I made plans to see it at some point.Then, on Friday, it was released, and the reviews began to come in. Four stars on Roger Ebert’s website (out of four). A great review on Slate. 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s an insanely high-level rating. By contrast, Birdman, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2014 has “only” a 93% rating. For a “genre” film to get that kind of high rating is almost without precedent.And so I went to see it yesterday (and yes, that was partly to annoy certain men’s rights jerks out there), and I was impressed. So very impressed. It’s entertaining as heck, yes, but also, surprisingly, very intelligent, has a good, strong plot, interesting characters, and strong messages about gender and religion.The story concerns Max who, at the beginning of the film, is captured by the bad guys (lead by a religious leader who controls all the local water supply), who plan to use him as a mobile blood bank. He’s glomed-onto by a “warboy”, one of the religiously-minded soldiers his captor keeps around, who attaches himself to Max’s blood supply. This get interesting when a woman named Furiosa (love it), steals a large semi that’s been outfitted as a battle platform. Inside? Several women who are basically the cult leader’s sex slaves. Their goal is to make it to an idyllic “green place”. The warboy goes in chase, dragging along Max (and everyone else, including a mobile heavy metal rock platform), and the movie kicks into high gear.I really cannot overstate how much I liked this movie. It’s easily the best movie this year, and one of the best new movies I’ve seen in quite sometime. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron turn in the best performances of their careers (which in her case especially is really saying something), and Nicholas Hoult still manages to somehow bring the sexy, despite being covered with way too many scars and what is possibly the worst case of chapped lips in all of human history.The pacing is excellent, despite being basically nothing but a giant chase for most of the film. Also, unlike many films of this type, the action is very well-executed, excellently filmed and easy to follow. At no point does one experience a real sense of spatial disorientation, as can happen with even a lot of the best films (I’m looking at you, The Dark Knight. This, I suspect, is helped by the fact that the director, who made the original 1908s movies, used largely practical effects and vehicles. Yes, almost no CGI is used, and that really shows.If you’re looking for an enjoyable, escapist film that you can have a great time watching while eating popcorn, this is that movie. But, surprisingly, if you want an intelligent, interesting film that’s also great popcorn entertainment, well…this movie is that, too. An astounding feat.One last note; the 3D is well done, but not really required. If you see it in 2D, you’l be fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC9RG6LN1JZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ142MW#wasThisHelpful","R1RC9RG6LN1JZU","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do love a good pirate story. ""Captain Blood"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and much as Johnny Depp has gotten rather annoying, the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies were quite good.This is a non-fiction story, and it's not exactly a pirate story. Rather it's about two men and their efforts at finding a sunken pirate ship. It was news to me that only one sunken pirate ship has been confirmed to have been found. These men, experienced divers who had planned to hunt down a lost treasure ship worth tens of millions of dollars, plan to be the second.It's an interesting story that's almost Crichton-esque in the way it focuses on the men and their technology, and I say that in a good way. The personalities of both men come through on the page in great detail, as does the work they're doing. Further, the pirate whose ship they are after (John Bannister, a pirate so obscure he doesn't have a Wikipedia page. Yet), seems like a fascinating individual.Do they find the ship? I won't spoil that for you. But I will say that in some ways, it doesn't really matter. The journey to the destination is where the real fun lies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJPPGK33KZWF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400063361#wasThisHelpful","RJPPGK33KZWF2","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Dark Eyes series has suffered from one major problem: it isn’t what a lot of fans feel it should be.For those who remember, “To the Death”, the climax of the Eighth Doctor Adventures series, ended with a rather amazing set of tragedies, and the Doctor swearing to do something to change that. From there we went into the first Dark Eyes set, where the Doctor…changes his clothes and gets a haircut. There’s no real follow-up to what he said, and what he said felt very much like a lead-up to the events of the Time War, so we had all had quite a bit of anticipation. We knew we wouldn’t get the war itself, obviously, but just the lead-up to it would have been nice!But no. Instead we got the haircut, the new clothes, and a new companion. Dark Eyes 2 was more of the same, bringing us the new Master, as well as the return of Liv Chenka, a med-tech who had appeared in a Seventh Doctor audio. That story climaxed with the Master somehow kidnapping the Doctor’s companion and, with an additional companion of his own, setting out to do what he does.Now we’re on the third set, and the Dark Eyes concept, while solid, is getting a bit stale. This was by no means a bad set of stories, but it was certainly the weakest of the series so far.Of the four stories presented here, the first is easily the most entertaining while the third is probably the best. The first, “The Death of Hope”, features many elements of a western and is very much a “Doctor-lite” story. In it, the Master, his companion Sally, and their kidnap victim Molly, show up at a human colony that is trying to survive against the Eminence and their Infinite Warriors. The Master has a dark and sinister plan, of course, but implementing it requires that he saves the colony; that he becomes, in his special way, the hero.I quite liked that touch, and the framing narrative of the Doctor and Narvin watching all this unfold worked out quite well. It also did a good job of laying out the stakes for us so we’d have some understanding of the Eminence and what they’re up to, as well as laying the groundwork for the rest of the Master’s efforts.Sadly, the second story, “The Reviled”, didn’t quite churn along as interestingly. It wasn’t bad, and it was a bit dull. It also didn’t help that the alien species on the planet where the story took place had voices that were similar enough to that of the Eminence that I had occasional trouble telling who was who. Also, a note to Big Finish and everyone who works with actors, if you’re going to hire a “name” actor like Sacha Dhawan (previously seen playing Warris Hussien in “An Adventure in Space and Time”), don’t hide them under so much make up (or in this case, modulate their voice so much), that we can’t tell who they are. It reminds me of the Transformers franchise, where Hugo Weaving played Megatron, though not so you’d notice.But then we hit “Masterplan”, which was quite a bit better. In this one we have the Doctor and the Master trapped together in a locked room for quite a good part of the story, and that’s an excellent thing. Macqueen and McGann really work quite well together as a pairing, and I was very pleased with the result of their efforts; so much so that I was annoyed when we kept revisiting what was happening with Sally and Liv.The set rounds out with “Rule of the Eminence”, and this story was…ok. It wasn’t bad, but it was a bit of a “shrug” story, and it leads to the real problem with this box set and with the Eminence in general: they just aren’t that interesting of an adversary.Oh, sure, it’s nice to have a break from the Daleks (very nice), but there are so many other, far more interesting villains out there. The Eminence is a gaseous lifeform that basically causes people to turn into zombies that it can control. Eh. How is this fundamentally different from the Cybermen turning people into cyborgs under their control? Or the Daleks turning people into Daleks?There is nothing especially threatening about the Eminence. There also isn’t much terribly threatening or interesting about the Daleks and Cybermen, but at least with them we have something of a legacy, and we’ve seen them on the TV. The same cannot be said for the Eminence. We’ve seen (heard) them with the Fourth Doctor, the Sixth Doctor and now the Eighth, and they just aren’t working. Big Finish needs to either retire them or rework them, because as it is, my reaction to them tends to be, “Oh. Those guys.” Thank goodness it sounds like Dark Eyes 4 will feature the Sontarans.Now. Can I recommend this set? Well, first, you don’t have to listen to the previous two, but it does help quite a bit. It’s also good background to listen to the Fourth and Sixth audios that featured the Eminence. I will say that the first and third stories really do make for some great listening, and since you have to buy the set to have those two, I suppose that I can recommend it. But not with any real enthusiasm.I do understand that the plans are to retire the Dark Eyes line after the next set. I’m quite ok with that. And I very much hope that whatever comes after it is either a real follow-up to the events of “To the Death” or a return of the Eighth Doctor to the main range. I’m sure I’m not alone in wanting to find out what happened with Mary, for example (I didn’t really care for her stories, but I hate loose ends), and it would be nice to have more than just one or two appearances by Eight each year.In the meantime, I think it’s time to queue up some of the old Lucie Miller stories, and remember what once was.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3PLQY4EQYVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781783055#wasThisHelpful","R2S3PLQY4EQYVM","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this is a very interesting idea! Sending the Doctor to Earth a year before the end of the Dalek occupation. This means that the Sixth Doctor has to be very careful how he acts, lest he create a problem for when the First Doctor arrives.So there’s that ethical problem, and it’s a bit bigger than it might otherwise be, because Peri is still very nervous and uncertain about the Doctor, having reunited with him after several years of being away. To her, it looks like he might just be being a coward.Add to that the challenge, for the writers, of making this a story that could well have taken place during the First Doctor’s run, and therefore having to include Robomen, who were a silly concept, but are used to great effect here.Really, this whole story had a lot working against it, and I’m pleased to report that Big Finish pulled it off and then some. This is one of their better Dalek stories, and probably the best story in the main range for this year.Everything about this story works and works well. The Doctor dealing with a Dalek threat, but not being able to deal with the real Dalek threat is handled nicely. There’s also some great scenes with Peri getting really familiar with dangerous botany.I also have to give my usual kudos to everyone involved in the acting department. Briggs does his usual excellent job with the Daleks, and Baker and Bryant are both their wonderful selves. I also want to praise Tracey Wiles, who takes a new character and really infuses her with some greatness.I’d say if I have to recommend one good, solid, 2014 main range story for a newcomer, this would be it. It’s not part of any great arcs, but it is still a great story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DW1QBS66L5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781783349#wasThisHelpful","R19DW1QBS66L5U","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice pair of tools. You get an impact driver and a drill, and they're pretty darn good. Each is lightweight and easy to use, with reversible motors, a small light, variable speeds and different torque settings.I tested these out with a pair of boards and some drill bits. After some fiddling around, I was able to drill no problem, using the thinnest bit and then the thickest. There were some mild issues at first, with the bit getting jammed in the wood, but we were able to resolve that fairly quickly once we discovered the torque settings.The lifetime batteries are a nice touch. I haven't charged these since I got them, and while I haven't used them very much, it is worth noting that they've held up well and haven't had to be recharged.Really, this is a good set at a good price.

"Oh, I do love the Lego X game series. They've all been quite excellent, but this one really sets the new gold standard. Everything you love about the previous games is here (characters, comedy, collecting), but everything about it is improved.Let's start with the plot. Brianiac pops up and plans to shrink the world, as he does. Meantime, the various different colored Lanterns pop up to do what they do. At the same time, Lex Luthor, the Joker, and others are scheming their way onto the Justice League Satellite of Love. Oh, and Hawkman is trapped in a gilded cage.Got all that?The controls for flying, especially, are vastly improved in this game game over Lego Batman 2. Like flying in the overworld areas is no longer a massive chore. Even better, you no longer have to look around for a changing station for Batman and Robin, as they can change into their alternate suits at a moment's notice. Further, you get to use the B button as a context button for various different tasks, including instantly changing into a different outfit.That last point I cannot stress enough. It is so darn useful! It's nice to be able to swap on the fly without having to get taken out of the story.Now I did see a reviewer who mentioned they had problems with their controller. I didn't have any problems with mine, except when I tried to do two-player with a friend and his controller wouldn't respond. A reboot of the game fixed that. For the record, I'm using a wired 360 controller.Beyond that, there are about 175 unlockable characters, including Shazam (Captain Marvel), all the various Lanterns, Batmite, and several special surprises that I wouldn't dream of spoiling here. The number and variety of characters really shows how aware this game is of its history. In addition, you get stuff from the 1966 Batman TV series, you hear the Superman theme when Superman flies, and, happily, the Wonder Woman theme when Wonder Woman flies.Really, I cannot think of a single problem with this game. I loved it completely, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1HMHZQN1FDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBBME0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1T1HMHZQN1FDU","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's not going to give you laser printer quality work, but it does turn out a product that looks nice and will more than get the job done.Setup was easy. It took about 20 minutes or so for me to get the printer up and working. I will say that the quick setup guide is a little vague on the plastic covers for the ink ports on the cartridges.

"Your enjoyment of this product will vary depending on two things: how much do you like dark chocolate and how much do you like coconut? If you like both, and you like them together, you'll probably be happy.As for me, I'm not a huge fan of either, and the combination flavor didn't really work for me.

"(special thanks to the distributor for providing me with a review sample!)This is an attractive glass pot. Nice pink butterfly lid handle. Simple, but lovely pattern on base, and handle.It also has a sturdy feel. I expected it to be a bit more on the fragile side, but it didn't seem that way at all.The interior strainer/holder is also solid and has wide enough slits to allow the tea to infuse well into the water.When ""flowering tea"" is placed inside, it performs as expected. It takes a few minutes to unfold, and sinks right side up as it should.  It takes a bit longer than usual tea to actually flavor the water (10 minutes at least for my preferred strength) but that's fine since it's supposed to be a visual thing as well. I suppose it has to take the time to unfold and all that.The teapot can also be used to put ANY tea in it.  Loose leaf or bag.  The built in strainer works well enough for that.So overall, a nice little teapot at an excellent price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWD2FVK83IPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPUH6SI#wasThisHelpful","R3AWD2FVK83IPX","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely little set of lightweight, portable, very bright lights. They're powered by water. Yes, really. You tear off a little strip at the bottom and pour in a bit of water. Voila, light. Very bright, but not very big, so it illuminates only a small area, but it gives you enough light to read by or walk around safely in a dark area without stepping on the cat.Now these are only one-use lights. You're best advised to buy a few and put them into your car's glovebox, your survival kit, your hiking pack or the like. Expect them to last at least 24 hours, and as much as 72. But understand that once they're on, they're on. They don't turn off, and once they're done, you can't get them working again.So if you want some basic emergency lights, these are a great idea![update: It may be worth mentioning that I powered-up the light on the 9th, and it is currently the 13th. We're coming up on almost 96 hours, and it's still going][update: Now it is very early in the morning on the 15th, over 100 hours later, and it is STILL going!][update: NINE DAYS. Still going! I've added a few drops of water every few days. I don't know if that's making a difference, but there you are.][FINAL UPDATE: As of today, the 14th of November, the light has finally died and will not come back to life.

"So you want a compact solar panel you can take with you pretty much everywhere and use to charge your precious USB devices while hiking, fishing, or fleeing a psycho at the lovely Crystal Lake Campground? Well, lucky you! This device is all these things.I must say I was very impressed by how compact it is when folded up. It gets nice and flat. Best of all, if you have several of these, you can connect them together to make your own personal solar farm. Now it won't charge more than a few things at a time, but still.One disadvantage to some other solar chargers I've used...this one isn't really able to be just mounted on a backpack to charge your device while you're out hiking/fishing/fleeing. I suppose you could, but I wouldn't want to try it, as I imagine it wouldn't be terribly stable.

"(special thanks to the distributor for offering me a review product)So you want a basic, usable portable DVD player? Here you go! This device has a good screen, good speakers, and will play your DVDs. It's far from the best on the market, but it's very good for the price.It also comes with several extra features. In theory, for example, it can function as a small TV. It really can't, though, not unless you have a digital converter box. It can also function as a radio, more or less. You won't be able to tune in very much, but it does work.But if you're buying this for the video games, I'd suggest moving on. The games are basically a bunch of knock-off NES and arcade games in emulator form. There's a controller, but it doesn't seem very sturdy. While the games might appeal to little kids, I suspect they'd destroy the controller in short order.Still, if you want an inexpensive portable DVD player, I really do recommend this.

"(special thanks to the distributor for a review set!)I don't often make cupcakes. In fact when I was asked to review these, I think it was the first time since the 1980s. But I hear cupcakes are a ""thing"" now, so when I was offered the chance to review these, I thought, sure, this could be fun! And it was. :)These cups are just about perfect. I didn't use any cooking spray, but they were non-stick, leaving behind only a slight residue that was easily removed. Also, I found that a quarter cup of batter fit just perfectly when I was making the cupcakes (strawberry flavored, btw). I will say that the one drawback here is that you will need more than one set.

"If you have a small cooking space, don't want to deal with grease splatters, cook only for one, and don't mind having very flat food, then this is the device for you.You've doubtless seen these advertised on TV, and like most TV gadgets, it does what it says it does, and does it well enough. It will indeed cook your food and catch all the grease in a little grease trap-like thing. The food  There is a little user manual that tells you exactly how long to cook certain things, and the temperature is always correct; no guesswork, no need to wait until there's blood on the patties, nothing like that.So that's all good. Where are the problems? Well, first off, your food will end up quite flat and flavorless. Physically flat, and flavorless because fat is flavor. No fat, no flavor. Throw on enough seasoning and you'll be ok. The larger problem, however, is that this is a very small device. It claims to be able to cook two burger patties at once, but...not really. Sliders, maybe, but the two quarter-pound frozen patties I tested it with were too big to fit on the grill at the same time.But those complaints aside, this does indeed do what it says it does and does it well enough.

"Ever since the War Doctor (or the Other Doctor, or the Predator, or the Renegade, or whatever we want to call him), was introduced last year, fans have been wondering just who he is. What was this man like, who seemed so similar to the Doctor we know and love, yet apparently was very, very different? Now we get a glimpse at what this man was all about.The story starts off on a distant planet, where a young woman, nicknamed Cinder, is fighting back against the Daleks. The rebellion isn't going well, and she's about to be killed by one of the Daleks, when the Doctor's TARDIS crash-lands and saves her. From that point, Cinder and the Doctor travel together, trying to unearth the secrets of a new Dalek weapon and save...well, therein lies the conflict. For the Doctor can save the Time Lords, but in doing so would be allowing them to commit a great crime. His moral dilemma forms the crux of the story.I very much enjoyed this tale. It helps that I'm very fond of the old series, so I recognized many of the references (""The Five Doctors"" in particular is heavily referenced), but I suspect even new series fans who have never seen an episode of the old series will be able to keep up just fine. I also appreciated the connections between the new series and old. Having an appearance by a certain Lord President of dubious character was quite fun, especially as he's still wearing a glove I like to refer to as ""The Hand of Omega"", but probably isn't.As for drawbacks, well, there really weren't any, aside from the fact that I was left wanting more. This story is clearly supposed to be the War Doctor's last adventure before the events we saw in ""The Day of the Doctor"", and so I do hope someone at some point goes back and fills in more blanks. It would be lovely if Big Finish were able to do so, but failing that, more novels would be great.A good story all around and one that I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCIXDBE3V1VG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0EYNOY#wasThisHelpful","RCIXDBE3V1VG4","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This series has been really irritating to me on several levels. Everything from the the so-called ""big switch"", which promised to change everything but in fact changed nothing, right on down to the way this book, supposedly the last in the series, ended. And yet...the story has been interesting enough to keep my attention and if there winds up being another book in this series, I'll probably read it.As before this book follows several characters zipping around a slightly earlier version of World War II doing various things. There's a Czech sniper in Spain (did you know it gets hot in Spain during the summer? In case you forget, you'll be reminded several times), a Soviet bomber crew (did you know bombers get lighter as they drop their bombs? In case you forget, you'll be reminded several times), a Jewish woman living in Munster (did you know the Nazis didn't like Jews? In case you forget, you'll be reminded several times), and others, all of whom have attributes to them that you might forget, but, don't worry; you'll be reminded about them several times.Yes, as you may have gathered, one of Turtledove's more annoying practices is back again. Also, it has returned. On top of that, it's annoying. Plus it's annoying, and back yet again.But...still I read, and still I mostly enjoy. In fact, I was generally satisfied with this book until the very end.SPOILERS from here on out.You see, the war in Europe comes to an end in the last few chapters (and yet again, a major alt history writer misses a chance to put Hitler on trial for war crimes), and that's all well and good. Germany isn't as beaten as they were in the real world, and it could be interesting to see how that impacts things down the line. But if I never found out, that would be ok.What isn't really ok is that the war in the Pacific seems to finally be gearing up to take center stage. Midway and Wake are both taken and things are getting interesting, especially as the marines who invaded Midway are forced to remain there under quarantine for an undetermined time.And...then the book ends. The apparently last book in the series. The war with Japan is just really getting interesting, and the book stops. Doesn't even really end, as far as that part is concerned; it just stops. Now if this is a set-up for book seven, which as far as I know, isn't a thing, that's fine. If it's just the end of the series, then it's very sloppy writing.Sadly, Turtledove seems to have lost his touch in recent years. The Atlantis series was drivel from the first book, so I didn't bother with the second. The Supervolcano series showed so much potential, but the second book was so dreadful, I haven't bothered with the third. Then there's this series, which again, had much potential, but, really, it isn't a very alternate history.All that said, if there is a book seven, I'll read it. If not, I'll probably read whatever Turtledove puts out instead next summer. Even his bad books are still better than most.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKB81ISCORD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345524713#wasThisHelpful","RFKB81ISCORD5","AN9J46667D80O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN9J46667D80O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"and had two kids pestering me (the weak parent) because they wanted to have the macaroni burger.  Honestly, I was interested too but I AM NOT A COOK, so I never bought one (and after A Really Lousy Experience buying from a TV commercial, as in, the never-ending-add-on-you-never-knew-about vitamin order that never seems to be cancelled no matter how many times you call…) I would never buy from a TV program.Amazon, yes, I would have bought here if I’d noticed them. But I did not notice these on Amazon, and ended up being contacted by a marketing company asking if I’d try it and give a review.  So, let me be clear, I DID NOT PAY FOR THIS.  IT WAS A FREEBIE.So, what did I think?  Overall and as per the Amazon star rating system:1 star: I hated it2 star: I don't like it3 star: It's OK4 star: I liked it <-------This.5 star: I loved itI ended up here, but it took a little time and patience to get to the point of liking it enough for 4 stars.I was sent one, and if you decide you are patient then one will suffice.  If you like to speed things up in the kitchen then the multiple item one might be nice to do a factory line type production.The other thing is the instructions were pretty minimal.  Nothing in the kitchen is intuitive for me so a very basic set of directions would have been very helpful.I did practice some Google-Fu and found a couple videos.  That was a time waster as they weren’t professionally done and there were too many pauses and illogical gaps.  A professionally done how-to video would have been great.  Or, an instruction book with pictures.  Something that boils down the steps for the lowest common denominator in the kitchen, which would be me or an 8 year old.Also, in messing about with the thing I managed to pinch myself a couple times in the handle.  I chalk that up to user-error, but still, that was annoying.The other Useful Thing to have been included would have been a couple basic recipes.  Of course Google came to the rescue but not in the way I needed.  Frankly, I have no idea how to cook a burger.  Seriously.  I also did not know bison meat cooks faster.  Oops.  Telling me (in the enclosed paperwork) to make sure the internal temperature of the meat was a certain number of degrees is not helpful.  First of all, that’s a pain in the rear, and second of all, what internal temperature?  The middle is full of other food!  Give me broiler times, pan times or even grill times as an outline.As a piece of personal advice, I would not start with macaroni (or bison burger).  That is not the easiest.  Go simple.  Some cheese, onions and peppers would have been much brighter on my part.  On the other hand, the leftover macaroni was good to eat after burning the burgers (did I mention bison meat cooks faster?).I also recommend you pay attention to the part about lubricating the device with a little oil.  If you make more than one particularly, it gets a tad sticky.Anyway, after a little practice  even an inept cook like me was able to figure out the right amount of meat and stuffing, and how to use the device.  It was fun and the kids even liked it…eventually.  I may even try the macaroni burgers again.  They really aught to be good now I've had more practice.Recommended, but the manufacturer should improve the instructions and directions.  Plus, practice a bit.

"Unfortunately the collar is so poorly constructed it did not last more than a week, so hard to say.  Also the 'scent' was strong enough to smell as a human (I wonder if that is a scent added so humans can smell it--it's a pleasant smell--and says 'oh boy it's working').  I should not be able to smell the maternal reassurance pheromone put out by a dog.However, the real issue is that the collar broke off.  My dog did not worry at it, or even seem to notice any more than her tag collar.  Yet the plastic broke completely and I found it at the bottom of her crate in pieces.  It should not have broken...I'd understand if she had been scratching or rubbing it on things in an effort to remove it, but no.  The dog was completely unconcerned by it (too bad I can't say the same thing about her around tall male humans and other frightening objects....).I purchased this at the local pet store, and fortunately had already ordered the original collar brand with this concept.  That one is on her neck now (and aroma free I might add--no gimmicks to try and convince me something is going on...).Oh well, so one star because the construction was so shoddy there was no way to assess the final response.  I'd like to think it was working because two people petted her that normally frightened her...but it fell apart long before this could be decided.JTG (with XTG who is actually wearing the collar)","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BYAU1Q2CZXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TLS0B0#wasThisHelpful","R9BYAU1Q2CZXO","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first thought was ""Just what I need, ANOTHER ‘get ready for retirement book’ (sarcasm intended)"".  Turns out this really is a good one (hence the 5 stars, I'd give 4.5 but it definitely deserves the round up).I get so tired of books and gurus saying they have ‘the answer’ when in reality everyone’s situation is different.  The books have a tendency to oversimplify yet become overly complex at the same time.  This one is nice because it will introduce a standard recommendation or ‘rule of thumb’ and then discuss how to apply or adjust it on an individual basis.  With rare exceptions the book will take a topic, give a basic answer and then proceed to a more complex, yet clear, explanation so that you can best decide how to apply the knowledge to your own situation.At the start of the book there are 10 recommendations for things you should do (not just starting at 50 by the way) to get a grasp of where you stand and where you are heading.  Things like:--figure out your net worth (always good to have a realistic grasp of) and how to estimate it--figure out your spending (your spending relative to your income is what makes or breaks your ability to be independent and deserves careful attention),--reduce your debt (um, get RID of your debt, debt is what keeps you indentured to some other entity…debt is a tool to be used thoughtfully, but overall it ties you down),--how much you should be saving (there is a great graphic illustrating how much of a salary you would need to save vs. age at starting to save to get to retirement…I would argue that your spending is a huge factor, but showing the percentages relative to age at starting to save, very illuminating),--plan your insurance,--your estate planning,--organizing your records.Plus a few more.  In fact, that ’10 recommendation’ section is a nice blueprint for a setting up a solid underpinning for understanding and guiding your financial health.  READ this and grasp it.  I would just add, under the budgeting and future planning…figure out what you NEED and plan accordingly, without blindly using an arbiritary percentage of your income as set in stone as to what you can spend or put into a retirement account--figure out what you need to spend and save accordingly.The balance of the book is divided into sections that are then dealt with in a question/answer type style.  The author writes a finance column, so this makes sense.  It gives focused and useful answers to the questions, and you are able to find the topics that apply to you without having to wade through a longer narrative in a more typical format.I strongly recommend you download a sample or do the ‘peek inside’ feature and you can see what the topics are—this will give you an idea of how useful it is to your personal situation.Basically the sections are 10 years before retirement, transitioning to retirement, living in retirement, maximizing the social programs (SS and Medicare), estate planning, and the final section is ‘the people in my life’—a random assortment of topics that can be very important.For example, the first question is ‘am I saving enough’.  The author boils this down to three simple things—what do you expect to spend, how much money you will need to support this, and how much more you need to save to get to that point.  That’s it.  I like how the answer starts simple and then she fills in the explanation including things that may seem overmuch at first—like the 4% rule, and then how that 4% comes about.  Or, if you need a certain dollar amount and you can’t get to it, well, then go check another question out (linked on the Kindle version) and get an idea on where to revise your spending needs.It also brings up my least favorite 'rule of thumb' where people are directed to look at their income and estimate a percentage of it needed for a lifestyle.  That never makes sense to me, is it your final income (you may not know what that is or it may be significantly different than your 'normal' income)?  Is it your average income?  Is it your typical income?  Is it your fantasy income you hope to have someday in the future?Question 4, tries to simplify the types of retirement accounts.  Okay, that’s a big task, but there is an explanation of the types and then a summary at the end where there is a (relatively) simple set of guidelines to follow.I do pick nits with her portfolio planning (please, don’t let your eyes glaze over, this is important stuff—keeping your savings ahead of inflation).  Naturally the Schwab models are used, and some of them are a little too much for those less inclined to deal with them.Fortunately the next question brings in some simpler approaches.  However, with only 2 questions dealing with investment planning this is one topic you might want to do some additional reading to fine tune a plan. At the level of this book, it’s a good start, but I would have liked a little bit more.While some of this could have been a tad stronger, the vast majority was very spot on at a level useful for most.  I also found some exceedingly interesting things I would not have sought out--like making a system for a spouse to take over if need be, some interesting estate issues and planning for a special needs child.I admit to glossing over the SS and Medicare topics, as I am a few years away and the details and rules are sure to change.  However, I’m better off for at least having this on my radar.So, this book really was a nice addition to my burgeoning ‘finances collection’ on my Kindle.  I loved the format—very easy to pick and choose the needed bits.  I thought the majority of the topics were extremely well covered, and for ones that weren’t so much to my taste, at least they were good guides for what else I might want to read up on.  There are plenty of helpful links both within the book and to sources outside the book (like to estimate social security benefits or jumping to a different question that is related).  Easy to use, follow and understand.Highly recommended!JTG (enjoying her ‘transition years’ working part time to buff up the savings so the plans are well funded)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZO0A7T25SFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO60EMO#wasThisHelpful","R1DZO0A7T25SFS","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kind of like finding skim milk in your coffee when you were expecting table cream.If you are a Hannah fan there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this one...more of the cozy sameness With Recipes.  The big fail on this is that there were something like 4500 Kindle locations (I don't have it handy to check) which is 360ish pages--not a long book--and a LOT of that is filler (the aforementioned recipes).That leaves a barely 'novel length' story.  A story that stopped halfway through.  Seriously, this can only be described as part one of a complete book.

"It was not a very attractive belt in person as the material was cheap appearing.  The hardware was decent and the construction appeared to be adequate.However, the biggest issue is the sizing.  The manufacturer does not give sizing information and using the generic sizing on Amazon leads to a WAY too small belt.  I have worn other Calvin Klein items (most recently some jeans that sadly had the button apparatus fall apart...hmm I'm sensing a theme here) and that size was consistent with other brands.  Why this belt was so far off is a mystery.Given the substandard materials it was not worth returning for another size.  It was just returned.

"I was a big fan of the first book-- a great start for a new/self (?) published writer.  It was little rough in places, but a fun read (IIRC I gave 4 stars), but with a little more depth than the typical 'light read'.  This one does have a few minor typos/gender change/word substitution sorts of things...very minor and not much more than one sees in a trad-pub, but as good as the last one was, THIS ONE IS BETTER.  The humor is not as evident and it was not a book I read all at once--I needed the occasional break, but only because it was GOOD and needed a little more savoring.  The characters move on and move forward and one feels very vested in what is going on with themOne thing I want to point out is that as a follow up book this one leans very heavily on events in the prior book.  Enough so that I wish I had read them consecutively--or at least closer together.  I wanted to go back and re-read the first one but my reading dance card is overflowing and I just didn't, which I regret.  If you can take the time, I do recommend reading #1 in proximity.The other odd thing seems to be with Amazon's cataloging.  When clicking on the author page I don't see both books, and the publication date for the first book appears to be after this one, the second book.  I suspect there was an update to the first book (which may negate my prior comments about the slightly rough edges) as the cause but I don't know.  In any case, this is #2 and #1 is Maid for Mayhem (A Gretchen Gallen Mystery ""Maid for Murder Series"").The only other issue that may bother some is that, though it's not a cliffhanger, there is a major dangling loose end that is clearly the start of the next book (my best clue being the teaser chapter....).  It is not enough to bug me, but if even the slightest sort of this bothers you, well, it's there.  The big dangling thread left in the prior book was tied in this one, so it does seem to be an effective and planned writing device.  Hopefully I remember that and re-read (or at least skim) this one again before reading #3 and hopefully many more.  And, like last time, I do plan to stalk the author's website, and I plan to do it more effectively this time around!SO, bottom line, a great mystery/borderline thriller in a nice Southern setting and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!JTG (or PTG depending on my mood and current reviewing pen name)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGL79Z7BKHA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPAGBD4#wasThisHelpful","RKGL79Z7BKHA2","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really Useful.They come in a variety of sizes and colors...the .14 size is the smallest I've seen.  These are perfect for small toys (think Legos/minifigs), yoyo strings, craft supplies, paper clips...anything small and easily scattered.  The tops are clipped close so you can drop them without losing (or loosing upon the environment) everything inside.  They are clear so you can see whats in them, they have a variety of colors which can be useful for organizing or just telling who belongs to what (Green is Jane, Blue is Fred, Purple is Dad, Clear is Mom etc).  They also are built to stack easily.They are made in the UK, which may explain the cool name.  I read the name and immediately had flashbacks to watching Thomas the Tank Engine and hearing the phrase 'A Really Useful Engine'.  Speaking of which, the larger sizes would be great for Thomas sets!I found these at a 'big box office supply store' but was happy to see on them on Amazon.  BUT, do check the Amazon listing to see who is the vendor.  If it's Amazon or a 'partner vendor' you can get prime/super saver shipping.

"It's hysterical to see her trotting around with it in her mouth as she is a rather medium sized dog (a 50 pound galgo) but she loves moving it from her crate to bed several times a day.

"Well constructed and not flimsy at all, and I like the ear wire quite a bit.  I happen to have a favorite bracelet with an oval darker amethyst stone that is surrounded by two pear peridots.

The peridot is almost there, but the amethyst tone is just a bit darker than what came in the mail.Excellent earrings.  Highly recommended if you understand the shade variations (whether natural to the stones or a monitor issue, which seems less likely given other purchases) and are okay with that.

"This is a nice light spray that does its job with my very fine hair.  Usually I'm trying for a straight look with a little control to keep the sides off my face (I don't know the 'real' words'), and when the can functions, it does a great job.  Also, it keeps the frizz down as one would hope with an 'anti-humidity' spray.  In other words, great for my fine hair with a simple style.HOWEVER, twice now I have had issues (the last two out of 4 cans) with the canister itself.  Basically, it was acting like a clog but when I tried to clean it the nozzle came off and was impossible to fix.  I have no idea if it really was a clog--and if it was, that was ridiculous to have happen with the inner workings.  Okay, not very technical, but it seemed to be stopped up and it wasn't on the external parts.Oh well, time to buy something else, which I hate to do because I like the spray.

But really, I just like having one within 4 feet of me at all times.This version of the plush throw is an improvement over last year's version, which I liked very much (I'm not including the 'cotton plush throw' that I recently purchased--that one was also good, but a little different in materials).This one is similarly and exceedingly soft and does not shed. There is also no evidence of a chemically odor which had been transiently present on the first version, plus it is just a bit larger which is more comfortable for the adults--still big enough to be used as a bed blanket, but perfect as a throw.The one I bought last year pilled a bit and I expect this one will too eventually, that does appear to be the nature of these synthetic plush items.So far the new one has been reserved for the humans, and it will likely stay this way.  Light, warm, soft and cuddly--highly recommended!!JTG(I will try and add a picture of the one from last year that shows the pilling, but that feature seems to be hit and miss on Amazon these days).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QV2LI39YPY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BS4PP16#wasThisHelpful","R32QV2LI39YPY6","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... but makes it easier.Sometimes the economical way makes things harder...in this case instead of a multi-step process of messing around with a bridge threader plus floss, there is a simple one step--tear open the package.  Ridiculous and a first world issue, finding that opening two containers and putting the floss and the threader together together was 'difficult', but the reality is that when fatigued before bed it was too easy to skip the flossing.I have definitely improved my flossing habits by using these.  Pathetic on my part, but true nonetheless.

"I'll admit to some trepidation when buying a book like this--an unknown-to-me author in the genre of the small town/law enforcement protagonist/murder mystery with a cat theme.  Popular variations of this abound so I was worried about falling into one of the lesser versions.However, this one works and works extremely well, to the point I ended up buying all four of the available titles and reading them back to back.  The protagonist is engaging and her backstory unfolds gradually over the four books, and the supporting characters do the same.  There is a romantic theme added in near the end and it takes wee bit of a crooked path...with knots and tangles that still have some working out to do (though by the end of book 4 it's looking good).  Most importantly, the writing style is engaging and well done, and the characters are believable and all have flaws of some sort.I also appreciated that though the town was a bit quirky, it never went over the deep end.  I've recently moved to somewhere in the vicinity (well a hundred miles or so) of where Crazy aught to be and I keep hunting the maps for it and I love the region descriptions given.Highly Recommended!JTG","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DIZFS4ZS2IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVFCLS8#wasThisHelpful","R19DIZFS4ZS2IM","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have eaten these crackers off and on for years (decades)--ever since my mother was on a 1970s era health-nut kick and brought them home.  I was quite pleased to see these on Amazon as I have not found them locally.  As with some items check to see who the vendor is (and whether or not the item qualifies for Prime).  Currently these are offered by Amazon, but it's the sort of item that can have multiple sellers.In any case, as crackers go, they are whole wheat with a touch of honey as well as butter, sesame oil and sesame seeds (with yeast and salt rounding outthe ingredients--it's a short ingredient list!).They are quite a nice counterpoint to a strong cheese, but also quite delicious as a straight up snack item.

"I bought this to give one to my Father-in-Law, who loves it. It's sized for smaller medications and if you have something that needs extra protection, there is a glass container/liner that optionally fits inside (like for nitro I presume).The set comes in various colors so can be shared, or if you have more than one medication, you can color code them. Personally, I have added a few ibuprofens to one and carry that around. It would work for many other meds though (blood pressure, migraine, baby ASA etc depending on the size/type of the pill).Very handy but make sure you only have smaller tablets or items to carry.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFYI4H9QFDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P91E4C#wasThisHelpful","R1XFYI4H9QFDK","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One would think that even an inexpensive scale (with a 5 year warranty per the manufacturer's website) would at least have a modicum of usefulness or accuracy. This scale, not so much.I bought the scale this summer and at no point has it functioned in a reliable fashion. I can get on the scale going from 'out of the shower' to fully dressed including shoes and jeans, and the weight won't change. I can get on the scale twice in 15 minutes (without changing anything) and gain/lose 6 pounds. I guess I could say it's always been within about 10 pounds of my actual weight.Not Useful.Also, the spot that gets tapped to activate the scale is horribly unresponsive and the materials feel cheap and flimsy. Definitely indicative of actual effectiveness.After reading the reviews here and elsewhere it is apparent that my experience is not an isolated one. Too bad I bought it on the fly at XXXXXX instead. I'm now hundreds of miles away from the store, and as I'm sure the manufacturer relies on, it's just not worth the time and effort to try and hold them to their warranty. Great business model--cheap enough so it costs more effort that it's worth for a refund.So, if you are smarter than me and checking reviews before buying (well, it was before I owned a smartphone so it wasn't like I could do it while standing in the aisle at least) DON'T GET THIS ONE.

"It was short, funny and full of the typical things found in a Marr story, though a bit more fluffy.This one counts as what I refer to as 'a slice of life'.  It's not a full blown tale, but more of a 'I can't believe the kind of day I'm having' sort of thing.If you are familiar with the series, you will find this a lot of fun, but perhaps not as 'filling' as you might like.  If you have never read one of these stories, then this one can give you an idea of the style of writing, but just understand that it might not read as a truly 'stand alone' story.  There was a definite benefit to having familiarity with the characters when reading this.Normally I save the 5 stars for shorter stories to those that stand alone well.  However, when something is part of a well established series and it just 'works' anyway, well it gets the full five anyway.  Just be aware that if you are a newcomer to the series, this might be best thought of as a sample to see if the style suits--and this is a little higher on the silly end of the spectrum.RECOMMENDED (the whole series, even the one with **shudder** monkeys)JTG","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQZ0N61APQJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQYA8RC#wasThisHelpful","R2JQZ0N61APQJX","A11WYHDB1YEZOX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11WYHDB1YEZOX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find that many books are so full of (albeit useful) information, there is overload that leads to paralysis.  In trying to plan the perfect way to start, plant, plan and manage the gardening, it becomes immensely difficult to just begin.This book on the other hand encourages a simple/proven method that makes taking the first step easy.  Once you start, then you can expand in both quantity and variety with much more confidence.That said, even if you are an experienced gardener, if you are using a more traditional method then this book may also be worth a look.  Some very sage advice that leads to maximizing production while minimizing resources.As for format to purchase I have to confess I bought two versions.  First I got the Kindle version.  The text was fine, but the illustrations are not suited to the e-Ink screen.  I looked at those on my laptop and it was a fine rendition and I did not find any formatting errors.

"This is the second 'Pinzon' throw I've purchased -- Pinzon being the Amazon private label.  The previous one was a 'microfleece' type (called microtec) which after a few washed stopped shedding, was extremely light and cuddly, but was a little on the small side.  It has now been given to the dog, she loves it.  So, here I was shopping for another one for the non-fur bearing members of the household.  That throw is no longer offered, but the new Pinzon one was, so of course I'm trying it.This one is a 'cotton plush'--an acrylic and cotton blend, supposedly that is eco-friendly.  I have no way to confirm that but I am taking that statement at face value.  Compared to the old version, this throw is bigger--much more amenable to humans snuggling on couches (rather than dogs snuggling on dog beds) and is quite warm enough for cooler evenings.  It does not quite have the easy draping, and feels heavier, but if I had never tried the other throw I would be perfectly satisfied with this one.  In terms of size, the measurements are given, but as a rough guide it's about the size of the flat part of a twin bed.  I'm 5'7 1/2"" ish and fell asleep on the couch with it and my feet stayed covered.It feels sturdy and is well constructed, and so far no laundry issues.  It feels durable, and if it turns out not to be over the next few months I'll be sure to update the review.So, basically 4.5 stars--in comparing to other plushy throws it's a tad heavier and drapes just a little less...but it really is quite nice.

"which was silly because I missed out on Prime shipping.  Oh well.This was my second try to get an adapter for my iphone so it will work with my car.  I previously tried iPhone 5 Adaptor - Lightning To 30 Pin iPhone Adaptor Charge Sync With Audio For Docks Cables Cars By CableAndCase which was a failure with my various trials.I bought this one and plugged the 30 pin side into another adapter I have leading into my car (similar to this one 3.5mm Audio Line Out + 30pin Usb Dock Cable for Iphone Ipod).  After one false start with me needing to make sure everything was connected properly, it worked perfectly.  I have my iphone supplying my car music which is very important given my new locale (sparse and generic radio choices we'll just say).  Oh, and it was charging my phone too.The SF Cable adapter also worked with 2 other 30 pin docks in my house (a speaker thing and a clock/radio/ipod base).  I really only care about my car and I'm VERY happy to have a working cable without having to buy from the fruit company directly.The nice thing about this one (other than it actually worked) is that if the vendor continues to be an ""Amazon Partner"" and keep stock in the Ammy warehouses, if you find it does not work with your particular device, then a return is fairly simple.Recommended!JTGEDITED TO ADD:  Looks like this is one of those items that has the vendor change periodically.  Some vendors of the SFCable keep their stock on Ammy's shelves (thus prime).  Some don't...the vendor du jour on 9.26.13 is the actual manufacturer...price is lower but there is shipping.

"This is a very cool light.It runs on 3 AAA batteries, and the LED lamp puts out a TON of light, much more than expected. The only button on it controls the on/off for the light, and it's sturdy and well placed.What makes this really cool, however, are the myriad of options you have for keeping this thing shining on whatever you're looking at. The green ""feet"" swivel in such a way that you can either clamp the light directly to something, or you can lock the handle open (sort of like a gas pump) and set it down on something flat. The light itself then swivels around and stays where you put it. You can also lay it on its side and swivel the head for much the same effect. Of course you can also keep the top flat on its base and use it the same way you would a flashlight as well.This product is fairly tough, and I think up to the task of handling most general household encounters.

In this capacity it's as perfect as it gets, it's very well thought out.The billfold itself has a crazy strong magnet that keeps it securly fastened to the back of the case with bills and without, and the card pocket is just the right size for several cards, and they won't fall out.

"If you've had any experience with blue-tooth speakers, you pretty much get how this device works:First, the charge, which is typical for this sort of thing at a couple hours. There is a light to tell you when it's done charging.Second, the peering is more or less identical to most items like this (when your device detects it, say 'ok', which varies by device). I was able to peer it with the usual cast of characters... tablet, PC, smartphone, MP3 player, etc... I run both Windows and Ubuntu Linux at home, it works fine with all of them. I did not need the password specified in the product instructions.I was able to easily control/iterate through my music (while showering no less!), controls all function well as advertised.This speaker is indeed waterproof; I've had no issues whatsoever using it in the shower. The suction cup is a beast, I may use it to recover the Titanic one day. And overall it looks pretty cool.The packaging is well done, this would make a good gift for someone that would appreciate it. The instructions appear to be clear and accurate (although a bit small for my aging eyes!), I must admit though that I didn't need them... as I said before, if you have any experience with these sorts of things it's more or less a no-brainer.The only reason I didn't give the product 5-stars is that at $38.95, the price seems a bit steep to me. There's a lot of bluetooth speakers on the market today, and while this does sound fantastic (considering it's waterproof), I just feel like I could get something similar for less.

"This DVD is full of useful information for any guitarist that's ready to move beyond playing everything in a single position. The CAGED system is straight-forward and easy to pick up, and this DVD spends a fairly large amount of time on each element, as well as linking the various elements together.The guitar is an instrument of equivalencies; there's usually at least one or two additional ways that you can do exactly what you're already doing, and a plethora of ways to vary each of those but still retain the same overall structure. The CAGED system is geared towards allowing you to easily see the entire neck's ""interconnectedness"", and honestly succeeds in this task. I've been playing guitar now for the better part of three decades, and I was amazed at how things that were right in front of my face that whole time suddenly became obvious (almost unavoidable) after I adapted this way of ""seeing"" the neck.This DVD is not for beginners. You should be fairly comfortable playing many sorts of chords, and have at least a basic understanding of how to find single notes on each string. Knowing the basics of the diatonic major scale would also be a huge help as well. If you're beyond that and know some more advanced theory this whole thing will come together fast and furious for you!Recommended!EDIT: I wanted to add something here. There are a lot of arguments going on all over the Internet concerning whether or not the CAGED system is really useful, especially for playing metal leads. I'll be the first person to point out that this system has some serious limitations when it comes to playing extended arpeggio runs and visualizing exotic scales. But I also think that misses the point. Every musician that attains any real level of mastery with their chosen instrument(s) has at some point come to realize an ultimate truth about their craft: there simply are no magic bullets. And while these systems can offer new paths to travel, there simpy are no substitutes for time spent with your hands on the instrument, making music in as many ways as you possibly can. In other words, it's like everything in life: what you get out of it is a direct result of what you put into it.

It's:- A good looking and well executed design.- Very solidly built.- It seems to be reliable.- Packaged well- Offers great access to your phones inputs.It's very cool that you can charge both the phone and the case at the same time.Bear in mind that this case will add a bit of thickness/weight to your phone, but I think that's to be expected with this sort of thing.

"I got this doll for my daughter, for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it!At first it seemed to me a bit on the pricey side, but once we got it I can understand why... while it has a somewhat delicate look about, its construction is first-rate and quite tough. My daughter frequently sleeps with it, and I've seen the cats launch some pretty brutal assaults on it, and it's still none-the-worse for wear after a few months. This is the sort of doll that lasts a long time.The whole concept of having one doll's head hidden up the other doll's skirt(!) seemed, well, really bizarre to me at first; I have to admit though that it works... once that dress goes down, the ""other"" doll is really gone.Well-designed and executed, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SI25D0VVRGX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT5SGXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SI25D0VVRGX8","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good book for several reasons. It's one of the few that take you all the way from starting with no idea what technical analysis is (or even trading for that matter), all the way up to locked, cocked, loaded and ready to trade. I think after you trade for a while you forget just how daunting those first few steps can be for many people.I've always been more of a technical trader (as opposed to trading fundamentals), it's a way of thinking I was first exposed to as a teenager, and using this perspective I was able to trade futures with a fair degree of success. Since then I've also traded stocks and Forex this way, and I've found that many of these techniques hold-up in, well, any market really.This book covers a lot of ground, from understanding markets and their trends, older techniques such as moving averages, candlesticks, trend patterns, etc... and also using more advanced analysis techniques available with most modern trading software. It's a lot, but it's written in a highly accessible, no-nonsense language that reflects the considerable amount of experience of the author. I found it to be a nice refresher.I don't think this book is really aimed at seasoned traders; it's quite broad, I think seasoned traders wouldn't get a whole lot from it, although I could be wrong about that, I guess I'm just speaking for myself. I will say that if you are just getting started however this book is pure gold, it basically hands you everything to enter the market and not lose your butt!Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH9JNRDM64LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PURYRJI#wasThisHelpful","RUH9JNRDM64LN","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like these a lot!- They're packaged well.- They curl up to basically nothing. One of the many things about conventional earbuds that drive me crazy is that if you're not super-careful and just throw them in heap somewhere, you spend like two minutes untangling them when you want to use them again. Not so with these.- They're fairly resilient as these sorts of things go. In other words, with normal wear and tear, they should last a while.- VERY comfortable, they anchor themselves to my head and stay put.- It has a microphone, honestly I just use them for music though.- Easy to peer up with a music source.- They sound great to me!Again, headphones in general usually end up making me mad... these seem like a fair trade off, and they're very comfortable.

"I always try to review things at the intersection of price and quality; in other words: value.These bags, for the price and quantity of them received, are pretty good.What I like:- They're inexpensive, and you get four.- The canvas cloth is a nice touch, they seem more ""real"" than cheap plastic cases, if that makes any sense.- They're reasonably well made.- The zippers seem to function well.- They can be used for much more than just pens and pencils.What I Don't Like:- They could be a little longer so pencils fit in there better.- The cloth is a bit thin, no so bad though.I gave these to my 7-year old daughter. She uses one as an actual pencil/crayon bag at school, and uses another as a ""make-up"" bag of sorts, and others to hold collections of the sort of trinkets that 7-year old girls have.I could see using this for sewing ""stuff"", or maybe something to throw change into.So hey, I'm happy.

The arms are super-adjustable, and don't feel flimsy or short-lived.The pink, purple and white shades are very cool also, they match my daughter's room perfectly.The only complaint I have about this light is the 40w restriction (per bulb), it doesn't throw off a ton of light, but it's certainly adequate, and you can adjust the direction of the lights as needed.Good stuff!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUDNMMP8SWR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WUXQA4#wasThisHelpful","R1OUDNMMP8SWR3","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using my Opinel knife for maybe 5 or so years... many, MANY mushrooms have met their demise because of it, and it's still none-the-worse for wear.

"Ditto to the other reviews.What's nice:- These gloves are packaged great.- I'm an XL, I have very big hands. Sometimes, even when I order stuff in this size, it still doesn't quite fit right. These gloves are spot-on.- They are quality. These gloves are tough as nails, made of actual leather(!), and are well-finished. I anticipate having them for awhile.- They work great for lifting. They do a wonderful job of giving your hand support as you lift, and keep you from getting calluses and blisters that you'll eventually shear off (ouch!) when you lift something else.- They break in well.

"You know, every once and a while you run across a product that's almost too good to be true. I've been shaving with a DE razor for perhaps five years now, and I really like trying new stuff, but I must admit I've gotten set in my ways because I've found what works.I usually shave with Bigelow or Proraso cream in a tube, although I'll use a high-end soap cake from time to time, there's a lot of good stuff out there. So one day I ordered some shaving ""thing"" from someone, and along with the ""thing"" they threw in a free stick of Arko. Even though I had heard some good things about it, I stuck it up in my cabinet and forgot about it, and went back to using my Bigelow.About two months ago I happened to reach for the Bigelow tube and realized it was empty. Suddenly I remembered the stick of Arko that had been sitting in my cabinet for the last year(!) or so, and decided to give it a try while I was waiting for more of something else to show up. I like to use a scuttle, and the idea of just ""drawing on my face"" didn't really appeal to me too much, but hey, any port in a storm, right?So I got my face moist with warm water and I basically started ""drawing"" on it with the Arko stick. The smell is ok, it's just not TOBS or anything like that. I wet my brush down and started whipping up my neck with it and was amazed at how quickly it turned into a nice lather. It took all of 15 seconds. I had a great shave.The really crazy part is that the amount of soap that it took for my shave was essentially too small to notice! Let's just say I got used to this stuff really, REALLY fast, and it's now my go-to shave, at least for the time being. So here we are, at least two months later, and I still have well over a third of the stick left!Highly recommended.I'll say this also: some of these reviews mention the lack of good foam with this product. I've found that the foam is definitely different with the more utilitarian products, its more ""soapy"" and less ""creamy."" That being said though, this stuff produces more than enough for me, but that's me. I also know that water hardness makes a huge difference in the foam quality, you might want to try it again, but use some distilled water... the difference can be massive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF2BNF39QTIC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A5OLHQ#wasThisHelpful","RF2BNF39QTIC3","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally reviewed this on the main Condor page here on Amazon, but I bought it through United Cutlery so I wanted to make sure my review was here as well:I bought this parang as a general-use tool to have with me when I'm off road in my truck, for cutting away brush and also to have a general cutting tool for anything else I might encounter. In this capacity it is perfect.What I like:- It arrives well packaged.- The Sheath is breathable and high-quality.- The handle is comfortable and ergonomic, and the flares at both ends keep the tool in your hand as you swing.- It's well balanced.- It keeps a decent edge.- The parang style of machete can be used as both a general machete and as a camping/survival tool. It multi-tasks well.Nothing really stands out as a negative at this point, but I can say the sheer thickness and weight of this parang could be a plus or a minus, depending on the task at hand... it's surprisingly thick and heavy for it's size.Lastly, before you purchase this, be sure you understand that this is a tool, not a collector's item (although it does look cool). It's made of relatively soft carbon steel so that it ""gives"" instead of breaking, which harder, more brittle, steels do. It's meant to be used and abused, not hung on a wall. Don't get me wrong- the steel quality is great, perfect for its task IMHO. But I wouldn't hesitate to do some choppin' with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3QC5AUZFG3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E90IDV0#wasThisHelpful","RN3QC5AUZFG3G","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, this is one of those things where several factors need to be considered before you make your purchase. I'll try to be as detailed as I can, this hydra has many heads!The Packaging:This truly is ""a light in a box."" A very small box. The reason that this product is fairly inexpensive, I think, is in large part because it is you the consumer that puts it together! It's packaged quite well, and when you open it you get a base, instructions, a bag of wire-nuts and screws, a taped up cylinder of mother-of-pearl(?) discs, and a bag with 10.2 billion tiny slip rings (think miniature key rings).The Instructions:I'm calling the slip of paper that comes with this lamp ""assembly instructions"", but I think it's value is much higher as ""entertainment."" The diagram doesn't match the base in any meaningful way, and there is no mention of wire colors or proper grounding. They do an adequate job of conveying what you're shooting for in terms of linking together the disks, but really that's about it. Where these instructions really shine however, is in their copious usage of translated Chinese (""Chinglish""), which frankly will have you belly-laughing and is worth the price of the lamp in and of themselves. I would quote some, but I don't want to spoil your fun.My point here is that if you know how to install a ceiling lamp, you'll do just fine... it's simple enough, three wires: white, black, and copper (ground). If this is your first time hanging a lamp though, just be sure you get your instructions ANYWHERE(!) but here.Assembly:If you're a bit older, like me, and need reading glasses from time to time, grab them. You're gonna need them. And cancel that doctor's appointment because you're not going anywhere for at least an hour or two. To their credit, they give you plenty of extra discs and rings, so if you mess it up and break/bend something, no worries. But saying that linking all the rings together into the discs is tedious is the understatement of the year.One major bone of contention I have with these sorts of things (not just this lamp in particular) is that once you link it all together, you can't really move it too much, because every time you set it down something falls off and needs to be reattached. That's life in the big city I suppose...Installation:Piece of cake. If you have an existing standard ceiling receptacle, it fits perfectly. Be aware though, it only takes a single 40-watt small bulb, so it's not exactly gonna be a day at the beach in that room if this is the only light.Use:Here is where this ceiling lamp really comes into its own. After all of the nonsense associated with assembling it and keeping it together while I hung it, I have to admit it's a pretty darn cool lamp. I put in my daughter's room, and when only this lamp is on it bathes the entire room in soft purple light and projects a neat pattern on the ceiling. Very mellow, it softens the room up nicely. Again though, if this is your ceiling lamp of choice, make sure the room has other lighting options because it doesn't put out a lot of light.Well, that's about it. Personally I like it a lot, but it's not for everyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V60WJ1BOVSII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLCRWQG#wasThisHelpful","R1V60WJ1BOVSII","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I've stated in other reviews of ""device armor"", I find that with these sorts of things you have to be a bit philosophical when evaluating them.This case, at this price point, is awesome as a general piece of protection for your iPad if you're just looking to protect from the general knocks and bumps of use around the house, or the kids, maybe general travel. Especially cool is the way the corners grab fabrics that you lay it on - if you throw it on the edge of the bad, it stays put.As mentioned in other reviews, the screen protector isn't very useful; this thing is more for the armor than anything else. So the screen is going to be wide-open and exposed (not so unusual). I guess the point is that is if what you need is complete protection for your device, this isn't the one.

"You know, back in 2007 when I first refinanced my brand new $90,000 house for $250,000, and then $400,000, I was a little concerned that my granite-lined nursury didn't have enough accoutrements to fostor the sort of genius that my offspring will have.

Standing in front of Home Depot at 6am every day and bargaining for cash jobs is hard work; we're entitled to have a few of the finer things that life has to offer.So after I got my wife and I matching BMW X3 SUV's with the refi money, I decided that the next worthy thing on the list is something that would brighten up my daughter's life, not to mention her room! I searched for many hours for the perfect trinket to light up her eyes (because I understand the value of money), and I believe I found it in this great product, which I purchased, sight unseen, simply by adding it to my cart and charging it. I could have used the cash I had on hand I suppose, but part of being wealthy is managing your debt, and my 22% APR Capital One card seemed like a prudent move.At any rate, when it arrived at my door it was stunning, with all the diamonds and stuff. It occured to me that at two years old, my daughter might be getting towards the end of her pacifier days, but I don't really pay too much attention to that sort of thing. I'm usually drunk on Miller High Life by the time I get home every day, can you blame me? I gave it to her anyway, and I have to say that for the next 40 minutes my little princess was enraptured... success!A little bit later I noticed that her fascination with it had ended, and her eyes were now transfixed on a piece of cat poop that had somehow been dragged up from the basement and into the living room. Her moment was over.So I took the pacifier and placed it in a conspicuous place in her room, next to her crib, under some Pottery Barn track lighting. It matches our changing table carved from mammoth ivory perfectly, which is new also, but that's another review. It now sits proudly on display in her room, 3-carats of shining glory, unless we happen to be using it as a doorstop (which is more often than not anymore).If you've arrived, you need to tell the world, and this outstanding product is the perfect way to do so!!! Even though things haven't been quite as good for the last few years, once those house appraisels get back up there we should be just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103YBT272HOIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VG4608#wasThisHelpful","R103YBT272HOIK","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a lot of of fishing, mostly fly-fishing, and fishing for stripers, blues, and seatrout in the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic coast with conventional tackle. I tend to buy gear that's on the bottom-rung of what I would consider to be ""serious"" fishing equipment, meaning stuff that can take a lot of abuse, but still needs to be cared for properly to really get the return on investment.This reel falls squarely into that category.I was looking for something to pair with a fairly nice 11' surf rod that I have, and did a lot of research before finally deciding on the Spheros. The only other reel that was in the running was a Penn (the model escapes me), but after cruising 3 or 4 forums I had read many complaints that the gears in the Penn were cheap and stripped far more easily than they ""should."" One thing was for sure though, everyone loves the more expensive Shimano surf reels, pretty much without exception. I pullled the trigger and made the buy.What I like:It seems to be very rugged and is put together well.The 10000 sized reel fits my medium-heavy surf rod perfectly. Although it's heavier than a fly rod and reel (so is a chipmunk!), it's very balanced and a good pairing.It holds a lot of line. I chose 16-pound test mono instead of 20-pound mono or braid. I'm not sure how much is on there, but it's a lot to say the least, maybe 280-300 yards or so.It has a sealed drag and cleans up easy, which is the name of the game in the salt.The spool and bail are very well balanced... retrieving line is a piece of cake even after your arms start to get tired from casting all day.It's servicable, and as far as I can tell parts are easy to get.It lays and throws line very well, I can get a pretty good cast off with a bait rig and 2-4oz sinkers.What I don't like:I really can't think of anything I don't like about this reel, especially at this price point. The problems that I have I think are more a result of my technique(!) and not anything to do with the reel.So far the largest thing I've landed from the beach with this reel was a cow-nosed ray that weighed perhaps 25-30 pounds. It made several runs and really did a great job of testing the drag, which worked flawlessly. I was able to tire and beach the ray, remove the hook, and release it unharmed. Anyone that's hooked into one of these can tell you that they can trash a low-end reel before you even realize what's on the hook!I've also used it for whiting, and was pleasantly surprised and how well this larger reel handled smaller fish. Croakers and spot (of course) also showed up.I would buy another of these without a second thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVWGMKORFYLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZMLCX8#wasThisHelpful","R2IVWGMKORFYLO","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one serious thermometer. I've been using it in my workshop as well as around the house... anything really that needs an accurate temperature is a breeze for this puppy, on pretty much any scale that normal humans use on a routine basis. I've stuck it into a roast. I took my daughters temperature with it. I've used it to test the accuracy of other thermometers around the house.I think chemists and others that work with tight temperature tolerances will find this item very useful.

"I'm not 100% sure what I think of this guide. I like that it's a bit old-school in its layout, and I like that it covers some species of fungus that other guides don't, which for me is the reason I've bought so many of these types of books.I guess two things rub me the wrong way a little: the color plates are inserted together in the center of the book, which is fairly typical for this sort of book (black-and-white, paperback-style for the text and copy, while the plates are more expensive glossy color), but I find that cramming so many illustrations on each color plate makes for a confusing search, and I also feel like at this point in time they really should use proper photographs in these guidebooks. Because when identifying mushrooms, as the old phrase goes, the devil is often in the details, and paintings are great for a lot of things but details ain't one of them. Honestly if you have even a modest amount of experience foraging for mushrooms the chances of you mistakely eating something dangerous is slim anyway, but having an artist's version of a particular mushroom as opposed to a photograph of the real thing isn't helping much.In other words, I wouldn't want a beginner to use this.The other thing that confuses me is this: As an owner of a pretty good stack of mushroom guides (and an experienced forager), I can tell you that there are always discrepencies between the guides over the degree of edibility of some species of mushrooms. Usually though the discrepency is small, maybe one guide says something is edible, while another says edible but it gives a lot of people a headache or something similar. I found myself with this guide really taken aback by what I thought was WAY too much caution with some species... let me be clear also that this is my opinion. And mixing that degree of caution with the ambiguity of a painted color plate just sort of confused me.Besides those two things though, there is plenty of useful information in here. Which, when you're hunting for mushrooms, you can never have enough of.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76PG4BXVF11R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0395910900#wasThisHelpful","R76PG4BXVF11R","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this MP3 player.It's fairly tough, the OS is intuitive, and it's easy to load on both Windows and LINUX systems (simple settings change). It also hold a pretty good chunk of music, a ton if you use the micro-SD slot.I'm very tech-savvy, but I'm also in my 40's and the idea of keeping my life on a smartphone has zero appeal. I like that I can put my music(or whatever) on here and just go, and I don't have to worry about losing a $xxx smartphone if it falls off me and onto a rock while I'm out running around!And on the subject, the actual ""clip"" on the Clip is far more than enough to keep this feather-weight device attached to anything.

"For whatever reason, I've always been a bit skeptical of these types of chargers. Don't really know why to be honest with you. I can tell you one thing though... that has changed.The charger itself is perhaps 6"" long by maybe 2.5"" wide. It's fairly blocky/dense, and weighs quite a bit for its size.When you turn it on, the LCD screen tells you how much juice is left, and hitting the power again fires up the worlds longest-lasting LED flashlight. There are two USB-ports on top, near the LED bulb.I fully charged the unit while I was at work, and while it did take a bit of time to charge it didn't really matter, because it's a background sort of thing. I've charged a couple MP3 players (one was dead) and mine and my wife's phones several times, and it still has something like 74% of its juice left!This thing really is handy when you just want to charge something, but don't want to boot up your PC or whatever.It really works great, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IM119KNZIHQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMEPUI6#wasThisHelpful","R3IM119KNZIHQ1","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ice cream scoops are weird. It seems like all of them have something about them that falls short of perfection. I think the issue is that  some scoops work great with really hard ice cream, some with softer ice cream, and still other work better with ice cream that has tons of chunks of various things mixed in.This is a really great scoop for ice cream on the softer side. It's very solidly constructed and the handle scoop-release works like a charm. If I had to find a fault in it I would say that the spread-handle design makes it a little tricky to really bear down on the hard stuff and coax a scoop out. It can be done of course, just not as easily as say an old-fashioned scoop with no moving parts.That being said you could always leave it in hot water for a minute for a little extra help.For me, I like softer ice cream, and this scoop is golden for what I need it for. And it's actually quite sturdy despite the moving parts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFJWOCRHAWVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF2QYMW#wasThisHelpful","RRFJWOCRHAWVO","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ""get"" Rob Zombie's films, I just don't usually care for them. His films are deeply rooted in the dark psychological horror films of the 70's, where the future is bleak and good guys usually don't win... I've got to be in the mood for that sort of thing, and usually I'm not.I have to admit though that for ""Lords of Salem"" everything I saw and read was SO all over the place that I had to sit down and decide for myself exactly what this thing is. And I think overall, while it does have its problems, I have to admit that I liked it. My wife hated it--but I thought it was entertaining, and it stuck with me more than a lot of other ""better"" films. I love Gothic horror, and I crave novelty. This film has its share of both.It really does have a ""Rosemary's Baby"" sort of feel to it, but with one major issue: I really have to agree with a lot of these other reviews that Sheri Moon Zombie, at 43, is getting more than a bit long in the tooth for these sorts of roles. She's just too old, heck, it happens to all of us. In ""Rosemary's Baby"", I felt real empathy for the young and victimized Mia Farrow, attempting to make sense of what was happening around her. In ""Lords"", however, Sheri Zombie is really hard to feel anything for at all... I found myself thinking for most of the film that she looked and acted like an ate-up (and selfish) old junkie, so when she went out and finally copped some heroin, I just didn't care.BTW, people in NA, those who take it seriously at least, don't spend the rest of their time drunk. Call it a faux-pas, you just don't do that.With that being said, the only other issue I had was the bad CGI of everything melting at the end, during the whacked-out ""concert"" montage. To the film's credit, it doesn't use any [noticable] CG effects up until this point; it's very old-school in it's approach, which I like a lot... so when those effects were stuck in the end, it felt cheap, like a music video or something.My complaints are minor. The way I look at it, if I put on a film and that film keeps me interested until the end, then that right there is worth the price of admission. And this film did just that. The story, while somewhat cliché, kept me engaged. And I like that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3VPT2QH25K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7C00JU#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3VPT2QH25K8","A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UTKTPFZ3UR4B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say that when I first went looking for hep in not only honing my writing into an actual book and then publishing it I was a bit overwhelmed by all the books, resources and contradicting information.

"This little ebook offers some general guidance on understanding depression and finding effective ways to heal and regain your enthusiasm for life. The book offers an overview of these subjects, and does not go into a lot of detail. It is rather short and simple to read.

"Anthony William is known as the ""medical medium,"" who receives psychic guidance to help people understand their health challenges and illnesses and find solutions to restore health. In this book he focuses on exploring a variety of health concerns that have spurred debate or mystery as to their cause and how to treat them. This includes ADHD, autism, autoimmune issues, candida, chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety, diabetes, digestive disorders, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus, menopause, endocrine imbalances, migraines, Multiple sclerosis, PTSD, rheumatoid arthritis, vertigo and tinnitus, and more. Williams is not the only medium or intuitive who skillfully addresses health issues, though he has garnered more attention and promotion than most. We all have untapped intuitive abilities, so what Williams can do is not exclusive or unique to him. I have worked in the holistic health field for a number of years and studied many different materials on these subjects; I also practice intuitive energy healing myself and often see people with the various conditions that are discussed in this book, noting the psychospiritual, energetic, environmental, dietary, and lifestyle patterns that are parts of the puzzle. Thus, my review is influenced by my perspective on these issues as well as my evaluation of the quality of how the medical medium presents his insights in this book format.In this book he tends to share some common themes that relate to health concerns, such as psychological stress, environmental toxin exposure, nutrition imbalances, and viral infections. This book looks mostly at the physical level of health to provide solutions even though it comes from a psychic medium. There is a lot of helpful and iconoclastic guidance in this book that I believe we can learn a lot from. However, there are a few flaws or misleading statements that I felt give reason to be cautious about relying totally on this medium. At one point he implies that the ""soul"" resides in the brain. In reality the brain is an interface and the soul is a higher vibrational field that accesses the whole body but doesn't reside within the body at all. He also gives his view on causes of conditions which are often incomplete and overly rigid explanations. They may be very useful and valid parts of the picture, but not the whole picture, and not precisely the same for everyone with the same diagnosis. He gives suggestion for herbs and foods that can help heal, which are generally very good suggestions. He is a big fan of things like blue-green algae and seaweeds, which I also find are very helpful for many issues. Thus, I see this book as giving valuable and often novel input but not a complete guide to any of the conditions it discusses.Some of the more insightful things he addresses are the immune system, endocrine system, and hormones - explaining how some types of hormones can suppress the immune system and how autoimmune illnesses are typically the immune system trying to address viral infections that have become embedded in our cells or tissues. He exposes how heavy metal toxins create major problems in our bodies, though he fails to mention how vaccinations have become a leading source of disruption to our body systems by their creating hidden infections and heavy metal toxicity within the body via injecting viral and chemical cocktails directly into the bloodstream, especially with so many given to babies with immature immune systems. I would definitely recommend reading what Anthony says about these various health topics, as well as the psychological and spiritual healing tips he offers. I would have liked to have seen him discuss issues more on a metaphysical and energetic level, while what he has presented is valuable and may open more people up to exploring the spiritual and energetic layer of their being. Aside from a few flaws this book is really a valuable source of information for helping people understand how to address common health issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RNBBB6DVIJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401948294#wasThisHelpful","R38RNBBB6DVIJX","A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the area of reproductive health and safety people are typically conscious about using condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs. However, most conventional condoms actually contain harmful chemicals that can foster disease. These Sustain condoms are made without any harmful chemicals, designed with all natural materials and lubrication. The manufacturer also donates a portion of profits to women's health initiatives. For anyone truly concerned about their health and the health of their partner it is a good idea to choose natural condoms like these.

"These shoe sole inserts are designed to boost your height off the ground a bit, mainly by lifting the heel of your foot higher. These provide some cushioning, though they are especially meant for the height effect. These do take up a lot of space in your shoe, so if the top of the shoe is low then your heel will lift above it. These seem to be ideal for about a size 9 US mens shoe. If your shoe is a bit shorter you could trim the toes end to fit, while if you have a longer shoe this might slide a bit. This is a useful way to temporarily boost your height, though it's not healthy to be shifting your weight and bending your feet this way for long. Just as high heels are not good for women's feet or spines, they can cause problems for men also. Thus, this may be something to use occasionally when you are in front of people who will look up to someone who is taller.

"From the time we are children we are taught to care for our teeth and maintain our dental health. Regular dental checkups and cleanings are a part of most people's lives in modern Western society. What many people haven't been taught is that dentistry has been infused with some misguided ideas and practices that are destructive to one's health. Dental doctor James E. Rota DDS has written a book called Mirror Of The Body to detail his own journey through dentistry. In that journey he discovers that his own health has been harmed by common dental practices and he changes his approach to dentistry to help keep others from suffering that harm, while also delving into detoxification and holistic medicine to help reverse the harm that has occurred.Dr. Rota's career spans from being a dentistry professor at UCLA in the 1960s to being a prominent dentist for celebrities in Los Angeles. His book includes endorsements from Dick Van Dyke and Raquel Welch. Rota writes a lot about the dangers of mercury used in dentistry, and the need for detoxification  practices to help clear our bodies of mercury and other substances that are impairing the functioning of our cells and organs. Rota shares about the discoveries of how our mouth and teeth are connected to the whole body, with each tooth energetically connected to a different acupuncture meridian. The book includes scientific references documenting the dangers of mercury amalgam fillings, with many online resources for holistic dentistry and healing options.Rota's personal healing journey is interesting to follow. Most recently he has included cannabis oil in his regimen of natural therapies to halt the growth of prostate cancer. Ozone, rebounding, saunas, and other resources for detoxification have been part of his protocol to stay healthy into his 80s. Something important that we can learn from this book is how an entire profession can cling to dangerous practices and faulty beliefs. As individuals seeking to be healthy we need to research things on our own rather than blindly following professionals who are trained to follow the status quo and maintain denial about any harm their treatments and procedures may be causing.For those who do have mercury dental fillings it is important to learn about safe ways of removing them as well as ways to detox the mercury from the body. This book provides some helpful guidance about this. It also shares general wisdom for health and healing that applies to any issue. Rota says ""Take time to meditate and reflect on your life. Clarity is important in the healing process. Embrace life's challenges, for there are lessons in them. Release fears and expectations. Find harmony within the conflict of life. Give ourselves permission for the struggle to be there and to release it. Establish your connection to the grid, to the collective consciousness. Be of service to yourself and to others.""Overall I found this book to be a nice account of the author's personal journey as well as a source of valuable guidance for reclaiming one's health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJ4R2CTRORH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WZLT6U#wasThisHelpful","R2WJ4R2CTRORH3","A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These solar lights are designed to automatically sense the lighting and turn on at night, off during the day. They have a dim light that will temporarily shift to bright when motion is sensed. These are simple to install, and include a pin to push through the hole in the light to activate them. Just let it charge in the sunlight and it will work fine. Also, be careful to position it away from anything that would be in motion, such as a tree branch. The only thing I would change about this type of light is to add an option of having them fully off until motion is sensed and maybe an option to just have them on at night with no motion sensing active.

"This probiotics formula from Viva Labs has some well-researched strains with 25 billion CFU to help you build up healthy amounts of beneficial gut bacteria. These are capsules which are easy to swallow and are designed to release the probiotics where they are needed so they don't get destroyed before they reach the intestines. These seem to work fine for me so far. These are a pretty good value, and probiotics can be helpful for a lot of health concerns so they are worth trying. As a reviewer I was provided a free sample for my unbiased review, while if I were looking to purchase probiotics I would definitely consider these based upon their quality and their cost relative to other good probiotic formulas. Different formulas have different strains which may address some different health issues, so there isn't really a single probiotic product that is best for everyone.

"This LED head lamp offers bright LED light, which is zoomable and has multiple modes. This uses 18650 size rechargeable batteries (comes with charging cable). The battery compartment cover is a rubbery, flimsy material, though otherwise the headlamp components seem solid. If you need a bright head lamp for working in a dark environment then this one seems like a good option. Just make sure you take out the batteries and remove their plastic wrap before re-inserting them for charging. This is a bit heavier than some other types of head lamps, but not too bulky.

"This high density foam roller comes in a suitable size and shape for a roller of this type. However, the density is too hard for what many people may desire, and the foam material has a couple of issues. First, it is likely to wear out and lose its form over time.

"This R/C Mustang car has an attractive appearance and provides good basic radio control functionality. The car and controller use AA and AAA batteries. This is designed for using on flat surfaces. The car is very low to the ground which means it will get stuck easily if it's coming over a carpet or some debris on the ground. I have the Maisto 1:14 scale version of the same R/C car and that is not as low as this since it's a larger vehicle in scale, but still has the issue of the vehicle not being raised up above the wheels enough.

The speaker has a TF card input so you can use a memory card with it and it has LED lights that become animated when the speaker is receiving input. The controls are easy to use and the speaker case has a solid construction that will protect it in case you drop it.

"Magnesium is a vital mineral that is deficient in foods and quickly depleted by emotional and physical stress - thus most people are deficient in magnesium. Unfortunately, unless the deficiency is so extreme that it shows up in your blood, your doctor probably won't realize you have this deficiency since the body will bring magnesium to the cardiovascular system and pull it from other areas of the body if necessary. Magnesium is part of hundreds of metabolic processes. Using magnesium supplements can thus help with a variety of health concerns - from muscle soreness, restless legs, fibromyalgia, bone loss, and cardiovascular problems to anxiety, ADHD, and insomnia, magnesium can be a source of relief.

It is a good source of nutrients to help with that and other health concerns, while the capsules are vegetarian capsules made using standard ingredients like magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide.

"Tryptophan is the amino acid that is essential for the body to synthesize serotonin and melatonin. Thus, for anyone experiencing depression or insomnia, insufficient tryptophan needed to replenish those hormones and neurotransmitters may be part of the problem. Using a tryptophan supplement is one of the safer ways to treat depression, and has a long history of safety and effectiveness. Many years ago there was a scare caused by a tainted batch that led to suppression of this supplement in the USA and the explosion of SSRI drug prescriptions. Of course, SSRIs use a dangerous approach to promote temporary increases in serotonin activity (by impairing/blocking the reuptake cycle) and often lead to more depression and other problems in the long term. I've worked as a psychotherapist for many years and have seen the harm done by psychotropic drugs, and I encourage people to consider natural supplements that work to help the body balance itself rather than drugs that disrupt natural systems to create a temporarily illusion of improvement. Thus, tryptophan, which can be absorbed from both foods and supplements is one thing I recommend as an alternative. This particular L-Tryptophan supplement offers 500 mg per capsule, with no fillers or additives other than magnesium stearate. Combining this with a balanced diet, and counseling and holistic therapy approaches to reduce stress and better manage thoughts will be helpful to relieve depression and insomnia. If you are taking any medications for sleep or depression you will want to consult with your physician when using this type of supplement, as when your body starts to be able to improve neurotransmitter metabolism you may need to reduce or wean off of medications.

"This is an essential oil blend designed to ward off infectious illnesses. These therapeutic oils were originally used in medieval times by thieves, who were able to stay healthy during plagues by using these oils. The Young Living company developed a blend based on the ancient recipe that they call thieves, so this Prime Natural oil blend emulates that formula. This is an effective resource for preventing illness, perhaps not as high quality oils as Young Living but still quite good, and at a more affordable price. You can use the oil as a spritz diffused into the air or place it on your skin, and some people will even place a drop in a carrier oil like almond or olive oil and use it internally.

"I was sent a sample of this for review in the Amazon Vine program and would like to point out that there are 2 different enzyme products from Jarrow that seem to get included on this review page: Jarro-Zymes Plus and Jarro-Zymes for Gluten digestion. I received the one for Gluten digestion, which has a somewhat different formula. You would need to be aware of which food components you may have a weakness digesting to decide which product is better for you. The Gluten digestion formula contains endopeptidase and exopeptidase, proteases, aspergillpepsin, and DPP IV. The capsule is a vegi-cap with non-GMO maltodextrin included. This formula is a pretty good one that is likely to help improve digestion for those with certain food sensitivities involving proteins. These are worth trying if you have some issues with gluten but don't have a major allergy. There are a variety of alternative healing approaches that can potentially clear up Gluten intolerances and allergies (especially from an energetic and subconscious emotional level) so I think using enzymes combined with those methods can help reset your system to start properly digesting these foods and stop reacting to them as something threatening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25AR6ADRJIZC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R25AR6ADRJIZC6","A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This charcoal lighter is a handy device that uses A/C electricity to generate focused heat to light up charcoal or wood chips.

Just read the instructions, which explain how long to heat it up before directing it toward the area you'd like to light. This can evenly fan the flames so that your grilling is more manageable and efficient. The one thing that's not included here is a storage container.

"This case is one that offers pretty good features and protection, the quality I'd expect from LowePro. As you can see the case is designed to fit smaller sized quadcopters and drones and be worn as a backpack. The exterior is fairly rugged and firm, while the interior has cushioned sections to hold the device and accessories. The Amazon page actually uses an image of a person flying a drone that would be too big for this case, so you need to read carefully to see what sort of drones will fit and see if yours qualifies. While this case is nice it is in my opinion overpriced. It seems that there is an assumption that someone who will pay hundreds of bucks for a flying R/C device will not mind overspending on a carry case. Thus, while this case is nice quality you may want to see what other options are out there or wait for the price to drop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDH0GFYT3HZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CKW0BA#wasThisHelpful","R2HDH0GFYT3HZ4","A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Denon here offers it's new WiFi streaming speaker/smart phone app setup, bringing forth the latest generation in quality streaming speakers. This speaker is a mid-size one with a sleek appearance. To use it you must download the HEOS app to your mobile device and install it, which includes setting up a HEOS account login. Then, you will connect to your home WiFi network so you can start to control your music and speaker activity with the app. This lets you use a variety of music sources, though you must use the app to select the sources, even if it's the auxiliary line input or the USB drive input. Thus, if your Internet is down you won't be able to use this speaker at all, even for a wired audio input. This speaker does have nice sound quality, which you expect from Denon, and it comes with clear instructions and good product support. It took just minutes to have it operating, and the app menu is simple to navigate, so you can choose the music source and control the playback. One thing about this speaker is that it's a technology that is soon to be commonplace and much less expensive, so unless you really need the newest wireless high fidelity sound system you might want to wait a while to get this type of speaker. Overall this is pretty nice, though the price is high for a modest sized speaker and it is limited to being controlled by the app, so it's not for everyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK3SKE2SCJ5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJJW39I#wasThisHelpful","R3QK3SKE2SCJ5S","A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve now completed three tests at home with the geoshield, and while that doesn’t compare to using it in the field, I feel like I have enough to compare it to, to get a sense of when it would be most useful.In my understanding of camping stoves, there are 4 primary driving factors:– Water boil fast– Cook and simmer capable– Weight– CapacityOther factors include: Environmental impact, setup and cleaning time, cool/fun factor, reliability (in general), reliability (in extreme conditions), effectiveness in windy conditions, and durability in packed/use conditions.The Snow Peak Geoshield falls squarely in the: High capacity, low weight, Cook and simmer capable camp.  But the Geoshield also tries to answer the windy/cold conditions dilemma and tries to be lighter than other similar systems.If you’re looking for a fast water boiler, look elsewhere. While the Geoshield is not slow (anything using an LPG gas can will be reasonably fast since setup and cleanup is so quick), it is among the slowest LPG stoves out there. Roughly 5.5 minutes for 35+ oz.The Geoshield most closely fits between fuel line extended stoves like the Optimus Vega, or the MSR WindPro, and windproof all-in-one cooking systems like the Primus ETA Power series (EF and Spider), and JetBoil Helios (no longer sold). It would also compare to liquid fuel stoves in form factor, but I’ll skip comparing those.When folded up, the stove/pot stand is about 5″ in length and about 1.5” in diameter. Which is smaller than the Optimus Vega. But it has two additional pieces (the floor reflector and the windshield/stove legs) which makes the whole thing take more space than the Vega (which doesn’t have these pieces, and is also therefore somewhat less efficient).A core unique feature of the Geoshield is that the pot stand stove portion has no legs, and instead, clips to the windshield walls which does double duty as the legs. (Note that the Primus ETA Power EF works somewhat similarly, but that’s another review). The windshield is also not 360, and has an opening on one side equivalent to two wall panels.One great innovation is the floor heat reflector that acts as additional structural reinforcement while keeping itself off the ground as well, which somewhat protects the ground from the heat of the stove.When opened up, the full diameter of the Geoshield is about 8″. Which is pretty huge (also comparable to the Optimus Vega). Plenty large enough for a 6″ cast iron pan, not quite enough for an 8″ cast iron pan because of the angled sides of most pans. Large enough for the x-pot pan, though maybe just a touch too much heat going up the sides. Would need a little testing to be sure. Great for a low-and-wide kettle.The geoshield is also made more flexible by being able to flip the walls. The clip-in indents have different depths on either side. If the pot stand and floor plate are attached one way, the pot stand is indented a half inch or so. If flipped, the pot stand is level with the rim (allowing larger pans to fit).Which also means, using this with very small ultralight backpacking pots is a waste. I boiled about 35+ oz of water in a Toaks 1600ml pot, and the large diameter meant moving the handle side of the pot nearer a wall, so the pot was off center. The heat coming up the sides was that much stronger than the Optimus Vega.The wind protection on the Geoshield can only be compared to the Primus ETA Power EF and the Primus ETA Power Spider. In terms of protection, if the Primus EF is the best wind protector, the Primus Spider and Snow Peak Geoshield come in second. In other words, it’s reasonable wind protection, but not as wind proof as the EF. Having said this, the floor heat reflector is the most effective I’ve ever experienced. Beats the EF, Spider, aluminum options for the Optimus OptiFuel, Primus Omnilite/Omnifuel, really, just an amazing heat reflector.The unit feels somewhat loosey goosey, for lack of a better term, and the material of the floor reflector is particularly flimsy, with the wall panels being not much better. But, still, it holds better than expected.  And yet, overall, the entire unit seems “strong enough” for any pot or pan as long as you’re reasonably careful.Where the Snow Peak Geoshield shines is with wide diameter pots, the wider the better.Like most fuel line separated LPG stoves and liquid fuel stoves, the Snow Peak includes a generator. The fuel line separated LPG means you can flip the can upside down to run liquid fuel through instead of vaporized fuel. This is important in very low temperatures when the LPG gas can doesn’t vaporize the fuel well, and also when you want powerful heat without relying on decreasing pressure fuel.The generator is generally a copper or brass pipe integrated into the fuel line that goes over the stove. The material is selected because it stands up to heat extremely well, but there’s a catch. Unfortunately, these metals are also much more malleable. Because generator coils are so soft and malleable compared to other metals, most generator coils are also sold separately to make replacements possible when they’re damaged. Snow Peak clearly considered this as they’ve put reinforced steel metal plates and bars to keep the generator very well protected. It’s one of the best setups I’ve ever seen.Onto the stove itself. The stove surface is convex, so the flame is facing outwards. The outward facing stove shape also means the burn-in spot on pots will be much wider.It’s heat efficient enough to make good use of an lpg gas can on simmer, it’s wide enough and low enough for stable pan cooking, and it’s advantage over the Primus ETA Power EF and Primus ETA Spider is that you can choose custom pots and pans more easily to get a more compact setup. Though…the Primus ETA Spider is pretty compact and also includes the cozy….I dunno, tough call.Best scenario for this unit? A cooking focused backpacking weekend, maybe ultralight on gear, but heavy on the food. With plans for stew or pasta or even pork chops for dinner, and spam, bacon, eggs, hash browns for breakfast.Worst scenario? Same backpacking weekend, but planning on mostly dehydrated food, hot drinks, oatmeal or similar, and focusing on other activities.Given that the cooking weekend backpacking trip is the most common type of trip for me, and probably many others, it’s definitely a buy worth considering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N1NYEYPGE6J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RIHDBCM#wasThisHelpful","R2N1NYEYPGE6J8","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The JetBoil Zip has been around a while, and is the lowest cost JetBoil out there.I already have the JetBoil Sol Aluminum and have been loving it.  But for my wife’s emergency pack, I wanted a JetBoil as well.  Looking at the various models, the JetBoil Zip was the least expensive, so at the risk of missing some features, I picked one up on Amazon.The Zip is really not that different from the Sol, except that it’s missing the piezo igniter and the fuel regulator.Is this a problem?  Not really.  You can use a lighter with the Zip to ignite it, and the regulator isn’t particularly valuable if you’re just boiling some water in reasonable temperatures.Overall, I think the Zip is a great buy, and while still not cheap, much lower cost, with all the advantages of any other JetBoil.I clocked the boil time at for about 0.7L of water at 2:41.  Certainly enough to get a good 15 boils out of it.  Which is plenty good enough for 5 days of 3 water boils per day.The gas canister stabilizer, the stove piece, the cap, and the protection cover/cup are all it comes with, but that’s really all you need.  The stove adaptor is a waste anyway as you wouldn’t really use a JetBoil as a stove unless it was a real emergency.  It’s just not really designed for cooking.Boiling water in colder temperatures (heck, even cooler temps) will mean that you won’t get all of the fuel out of an LPG gas canister, but it’s more than adequate for emergency water boiling use.With well over 30 stoves, from alcohol, to white gas, to kerosene/diesel, to butane, to LPG, as well as some wood burning stoves, all lined up in my garage and well used, there’s no question that there isn’t a stove on the market right now that compares to a JetBoil (zip/flash/sol) or MSR Reactor, when it comes to total weight (including fuel) to 1 week’s usage.Alcohol stoves are lighter, but a week’s worth of fuel will make the weight considerably higher than a JetBoil and 100 gram canister.  multi-fuel stoves are the heaviest of the lot.  And while wood burning stoves are lighter when you get to two weeks, the problem with those are supplies needed to clean them, time required to clean them, and inefficiency in setting up, boiling, and putting away, which makes through hikes just a little more of a hassle.So if you’re just getting into camping, and are on a budget, get the JetBoil Zip (and make, tea/coffee/hot chocolate, instant soups and ramen, dehydrated food, or oatmeal).  Most folks new to backpacking tend to want to avoid spending a lot of time cooking, and a hot drink that’s ready so fast that it’s just 5 minutes from the time you think of it to the first sip, is much more important than the ability to simmer a stew.  Trust me on this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2EB2P5I6P4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UVPDUM#wasThisHelpful","R1L2EB2P5I6P4E","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perfect for two light eaters on a backpacking trip, or one big eater.  It's very light, fits the Primus OmniLite just fine, and sorta fits the Primus OmniFuel, sorta fits the Optimus Polaris OptiFuel, and of course, fits most LPG miniayure stoves out there.  Fits an LPG stove as well when using the really small LPG stoves like the Snow Peak Lite, Gigapower, MSR Pocket etc.This set also fits inside the larger Toaks 1600ml pot and pan set.Of all the backpacking pot/pan sets i own, this, coupled with the 1600, is my favorite set.  The pan's handles are my favorite, and i love how the pan completely fits over the pot.  The other sets i own tend to fall off when I get clumsy from cold hands or not paying attention.  But these work excellent.  I even like using this set with the Hiker+ and the British Army Cooker No.12 or the SVEA123R.  Of course, with the eight stand and wind guard, it works okay with alcohol stovs, but you need a fair bit of practice with those to make sure you don't waste fuel.What's best is that it really is a full cylinder and doesn't have dramatically curved corners.  I really hate those curves that come with other sets since it makes slips and little spillage accidents easier.  I never have problems with these even when I'm at my clumsiest.  This is one of the last sets I've purchased, and since starting to use them, haven't really wanted to use any other stand alone pot/pan sets.If you're looking at these, or any of the sets from the two Japanese manufacturers, or the more popular USA brands sold at REI and AnyMountain, I would put these at the top in ranking order.

Something about 6 inches off the ground would be perfect.I thought this wouldn't be too high, but unfortunately it still is.  Shave about 3.5-4 inches from this stool, make it a tad wider, and it'd be perfect both for chores around the campfire and doing chores in the tent (e.g. Brewing some tea with a jetboil, or doing some maintenance or repairs while it's raining outside.Still, while it is too high, for now, i can deal with this until another comes along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343OJBL7EFZFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQU3WJQ#wasThisHelpful","R343OJBL7EFZFY","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways, this is a dream tent.  Sleeps two comfortably and has plenty of space to get in out of the rain, or keep your bicycle safe from the elements.There's enough space in the giant vestibule to act as a drying room (get out of the rain, and hang wet clothes in the vestibule), and still have plenty of space in the that area to have a  hair, and a small stove to heat up some tea or stew while watching the rain outside.With the separately sold footprint, you don't need the straps built into the inner tent to setup the rainfly, which means you could have a giant rain covered area for a few people to sit in when the weather gets a little rough.All this makes the Big Agnes Wyoming Trail SL2 ideal for motorcycle or bicycle trips, and pretty useful even for car camping trips.But....you'd have to REALLY want that vestibule bad to take it backpacking, and the rest of your gear better be insanely small and light.  Because this tent is large even when packed away.To give a sense of just how big this tent is, it basically fits vertically in a 75 Liter Gregory Pack Baltoro, one of the larger frame packs out there, and takes up half the width of that inner, leaving you with maybe 30-35 liters of space in the main compartment.  Not a huge amount of space for a sleeping pad, bag, cooking gear, spare clothes, and any other gear you might want to take along.It's probably be a little heavy for bicycle touring as well, as there are plenty of other great tents out there (though none this small has a vestibule that big, I don't think)The SL version here is lighter than the  original trail version, but that doesn't make much of a difference.  The poles make up a good portion of the weight as well.All in all, as a car camping tent, this one does an admirable job as one of the smaller, more compact large tents out there.  As a motorcycle trip tent, it might be ideal.  As a bicycle tent, a little resource management would be required, and as mentioned, you'd have to desperate for that vestibule to take it backpacking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTZSYNZNJ2YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ETQ6UU#wasThisHelpful","R3NTZSYNZNJ2YW","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of solar battery gear as my backpacking always includes a satellite texter and smart phone.My favorite solar charger/battery used to be another product, that was submersible, practically bullet proof, and was an all-in-one unit.  But it had three problems:  It was cumbersome, it only had one port, and that port worked inconsistently.Still, no other company really had what I wanted: - Truly weatherproof and reliable (dust, dirt, rain, snow, temp) - Submersion level waterproofing - Highly ruggedized - Usable when wet (don't have to worry about drying it out - Efficient solar panel (relatively)The Venture 30 bundle is all these things and more.Let's start with the solar panel.  The Nomad 7 is the smallest solar panel you can get from Goal Zero, and while it is not nearly as efficient as the Nomad 13, it is much lighter, and still much more efficient than many all-in-one designs.  It's smaller size also means that it fits onto small backpacks more easily, whereas the Nomad 13 dwarfs smaller backpacks (and adds weight).  Many internal frame backpacks today have tie-outs on top at the corners.  But they are not ideally located for the Nomad 13 loops.  The Nomad 7's tie-down loops are very close to the tie-outs on top of my Berghaus Centurio 45, Gregory Baltoro 75, Tatonka Lastenkraxe Packsack, and Twin Peaks Pocatello 75.  With its lighter weight and tighter tie-downs, the solar panel doesn't move much on the pack, which also means hiking with the nomad 7 is much easier than with the Nomad 13.The battery itself is really a sign that Goal Zero has listened to backpackers and finally understands what backpackers really want.I have both the Sherpa 50 and Sherpa 100, but I only take these camping when I'm sure the trail will be easy and the weather will be good.  If there might be some rafting involved, possibly crossing water, I definitely won't bring the Sherpa batteries as you never know how wet the pack might get.  As great as the features of these units are, it's just not worth the risk as the field ruggedness and waterproof just aren't there.  These units are also heavier.  Understandable as there are many more features, physical ports for flexibility (along with an option for AC power, and a smarter display.  But all those features pale in comparison to the importance of reliability in the field.  I love the Sherpa batteries but really only use them on business trips, or days when I'm running around in the city all day.The Venture 30 lacks many of the Sherpa battery features, but it takes into consideration what matters most to backpackers: - Three USB ports (two std and one micro), - A built in cable that won't tangle up easily but is also removable.  (NOTE:  the micro USB port goes in sideways, so won't fit smart phones in a case) - Minimal weight and size impact in a backpack - Enough storage for about two smart phone charges - Field reliable:  highly ruggedized and waterproof (usable when wet)There is really only one thing that I would want to add to this, and that's is a slim belt clip on the back.  This would allow the Venture 30 to clip to should straps or a belt to make the light easier to use, and also easier to leave hooked onto backpack or belt when charging for a more hands free environment.  It's true, you could put this in a ""case"" which has a belt clip, but it's already ruggedized, so a case would just add unnecessary bulk.  A slim belt clip on the Venture itself would make it considerably more convenient.Of all the Solar panel/battery setups I have, this has become my new favorite for backpacking and I look forward to several trips with this unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5T7JU9K2TDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY2HXE6#wasThisHelpful","R1M5T7JU9K2TDN","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OptimusPolarisOptifuelOptimusPolarisOptifuel2The Optimus Polaris Optifuel arrived the other day and as I tested and analyzed it, it struck me that Optimus essentially added different features from their other modern stoves to the Nova+ and released it as the Polaris Optifuel.I have a lot of different kinds of Optimus stoves, from the classic SVEA 123R and Hiker+ to the Vega, the Crux, and the Nova+, and many of the new features are direct from some of these others.Interestingly, it appears as though Optimus kept most of the core high-tech features of the Nova+, including the single nozzle (no need to change jet bolts), the curved wrap-around stand/pot holder, the magnetic jet cleaning needle, and the base and heat-shield.They then took the thinner fuel line and fuel line connector from the Optimus Vega, the throttle from the Crux, and changed the fuel line connector on the pump to a lindal valve to match LPG gas canisters.I’m not really sure those changes would make this qualify as a next generation stove, as to me it’s more like an evolutionary hybrid of other stoves, but they are welcome changes.The Nova+ fuel line is very thick. Not quite as thick as the MSR stove fuel lines, but much more rugged than necessary (have never had an issue with a thinner fuel line, so, glad the Polaris Optifuel line is thinner). Also, the Nova+ fuel line itself acts as the secondary throttle.  You twist the fuel line itself to open and adjust the fuel. The inferred goal for this is to eliminate the lengthy fixed copper fuel rod and throttle combination, but the Nova+ fuel line is unwieldy and ends up rather cumbersome to use. I invariably splash and spill a little fuel in my effort to throttle by twisting the fuel line. The new thin fuel line makes twisting it as a throttler impossible, and the  advent of the Crux throttling handle is a very welcome change.The thinner fuel line, being from the Optimus Vega, also has the side extension “legs” that are used to stabilize an LPG gas canister while it is upside down. This allows LPG stoves to be used in the winter, and also ensures you get all the fuel out, given that there’s always a few minutes worth of fuel left in an LPG gas canister in cooler weather conditions. They also found another use for these extension legs when incorporated into the Polaris Optifuel. Extending the legs allows the bottle to stay in the optimum position for “on” and “off”.Which brings us to the fuel pump. I’m least impressed with this pump and frankly, have never seen a fuel pump that matches the genius of the Primus ErgoPump. The new Optimus fuel pump is essentially the same as the Nova+ fuel pump, except that the connector is now a lindal valve connector, identical to LPG gas canisters. That’s a bummer. To begin with, the pump portion still uses an “L” shaped end, which is an unnecessary structurally weak point, and also slightly cumbersome to remove attach and detach from the bottle.But the bigger problem is that the fuel intake, the pipe inside the bottle where fuel enters to travel along the fuel line to the stove is still the crappy soft plastic tube from the previous generation.It’s crappy because the softness of the tube means that it does not go where it’s supposed to….They don't have a choice in this because that silly ""L"" shaped air intake forces the pump to be angled when inserting or removing the pump to or from the bottle, so the fuel intake has to be flexible in order to bend it during insertion or removal....You see, that soft plastic fuel line is supposed to be angled so that the tip is touching the inside wall edge of the fuel bottle. Why is this important? Because the stove is supposed to be designed to run either air or fuel through that fuel line depending on which way the bottle is laid down. Lay the bottle down one way, and that fuel line should be touching the bottom of the inside wall, hence, only fuel goes through. flip the bottle, and the fuel line should now be touching the top inside edge of the bottle, hence, only air goes through.But it doesn’t freaking work right….why? Cuz the soft plastic does not go to the inside edge of the bottle. Really a terrible design flaw.[SIDE NOTE: I thought about using the Primus Ergo Pump with the Optimus Polaris Optifuel stove, but this has a problem too. With Primus, the primary throttle is on the fuel line where the lindal valve is. With Optimus, the primary throttle is on the pump….so if I use a Primus ErgoPump with the Optimus stove, it means I only have the secondary throttle at the stove end. Frankly, I don’t know if that secondary throttle is enough or not, and it also limits finely tuned simmer control a little. So….no switching…booo].Apart from that one issue, I really like the Polaris Optifuel. It has all the wonderful features of the Nova+. including the wraparound pot stand and legs which is much more compact while giving a lot of area and stability for pots, the magnetic jet cleaning needle, the wide roarer plate to help reduce decibels a little (at least compared to the jet engine sound of the Primus stoves), and the simplicity of not changing the jet for different types of fuel. Great little stove.Incidentally, on the topic of not changing the jet bolts, I should say that it’s kind of a gimmick. You see, other stoves require changing the jets because different jet hole sizes are optimized for different types of fuel. The rule of thumb is the cleaner the fuel, the wider the gauge. So kerosene, which is a fairly dirty fuel uses the smallest gauge jet, while LPG is so clean that it is optimized with a very wide gauge jet. This is an oversimplification of course, as it’s really also the volatility of the fuel that comes into play. Kerosene requires a fairly high temp to become volatile, so the hotter the stove is, the easier it is to vaporize.  The smaller gauge aides in vaporizing the fuel. White gas is volatile at a lower temperature, and LPG gas canister, using propane and butane mixes, are volatile at very low temperatures, so there isn't a need to vaporize as much.In any case, the point is, on other stoves, you don’t have to change the jet bolt either. You can run kerosene through a thicker gauge jet bolt, and run LPG through a smaller gauge jet bolt. It will affect the efficacy of the flame, but it’s not a problem at all.It wasn't until I did more exhaustive testing that I realized something was up here.  The bolt did lose efficiency when switching to dirtier fuels, but did not lose as much efficiency as other liquid fuel stoves where I didn't change the bolt.  So Optimus is clearly doing something here to improve the efficiency of the jet bolt across different fuels.  I can't gauge whether that efficiency fully optimizes each fuel, but it does optimize it somewhat.Interestingly, Optimus chose to use a cheaper bag for the Polaris Optifuel and that’s a bit of a surprise. The Nova+ bag was absolutely awesome, and a great design in and of itself. Not really sure why Optimus chose a cheaper bag for the Optifuel. Bit of a downer.All in all though, if you plan on using mostly white gas and LPG canisters, the Polaris Optifuel will serve you just fine. And it still works with kerosene and diesel (not as well, but certainly serviceable in a pinch and you still get the blue flame when the stove is hot enough).With that said, I have to admit that this stove is fun to use, and I expect to get several years of use out of it. If you’re in the market for a multi-fuel stove, you could do a lot worse than this bad boy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9UKYTOVLSJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y79ZVLS#wasThisHelpful","R3I9UKYTOVLSJQ","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Primus ETA Spider is a wonderfully over-engineered hybrid of multiple Primus technologies all rolled into one.It has the stand alone stove flexibility of a backpacking liquid fuel stove, it has the wind-screen protection of the ETA Power EF/MF series, and uses the incredibly versatile lindal valve fuel line and highly reliable ergopump.The real magic of the ETA Power EF and this stove, the ETA Spider, is simmer control, and low heat efficiency.  With most other stoves, high heat output efficiency is the goal, so they are highly efficient at boiling water fast.  But with the ETA stoves, you can throttle heat back to a fairly low level, which allows slower cooking, or boiling water with less fuel.  Everything about the ETA series is focused on extending the life of fuel, and the difference is significant.Just one example:  Both the ETA Power EF and the ETA Spider come with a thermal insulated bag or cozy, which further improves efficiency.  When cooking stews, pastas in thick sauces, curry, and the like, you can cook the food to 80-90% and then turn the stove off, place the pot in the cozy, and let it finish cooking.All three stoves in the ETA line have very special features that combine efficiency and flexibility, but of the three, the ETA Spider wins the prize in flexibility.-----A quick word about the other ETA stoves:With a 1.8L pot and grooves designed for the 3L pot, the ETA Power EF is the big daddy of the family, and while its efficiency can't be denied, the stove is a part of the wind screen and can't be used independantly of it.  The wind screen contains the pot stand as well, further limiting flexibility.  This limits the stove's usability, as using frying pans or additional sauce pans becomes a bit of a challenge.The ETA Lite, while containing several well engineered components and a unique triangular locking mechanism, has the same limitations of most stoves that are lock-stacked above the gas canister.----The ETA Spider, the newest addition to the ETA family, adds even greater flexibility.  Really, the core stove portion looks similar to many portable stoves today in that there are three legs which are all folded together and also doubles as the pot stand, and then there is a fuel line to connect to a fuel source (gas canister or liquid fuel bottle).  This means that the stove can be used without the windscreen.The windscreen has three magnets at the base that align with the stove legs to keep the stove stable, almost as stable as the ETA Power EF.The pot stand portion of the legs come just a hair above the edge of the windscreen, so you can really use any pot/pan/cup you like on the stove.  You're not limited to what you use.  And therein lies the key differentiator between the ETA Spider and the ETA Power EF.  With the EF, you can use other pots, but it is cumbersome because the pot holder pieces are recessed under the rim of the of the windscreen, and you can't use the stove without the windscreen.Moving on the the pot (or sauce pan, if you will):The pot has fold out handles that hug the pot when folded in, and this then fits in the windscreen.  It's a tight fit, but fits just fine.The pot itself has a non-stick coating, and while this is much thicker than most non-stick coatings I've seen on backpacking gear, it's no where near the thickness in coating of a kitchen pan, so burn in will eventually occur.  Still, the coating is noticeably thicker than than the non-stick coatings on most backpacking sets I own, so with care, burn-in could be delayed for a pretty long time.  Just remember, the ETA series of stoves are very heat efficient, so keep the heat output low, and the coating could last a long time.The ETA Spider also comes with a food bowl (Just like the ETA Power EF).  I typically use that during food prep, as I like to pre-cook some ingredients before throwing everything together into whatever stew-like or pasta'ish or curry'like concoction being prepared, but if you have the efficiency to prepare everything in the pot and cook in phases, it'd still be fine being used for it's intended purpose, a food bowl.In a simple test, I boiled a little over half a liter in 2:40.  Really it was boiling at about 2:20, But I don't count water as boiling until the water is at its most aggressive rolling boil.Of course, the great thing about this set is that you can purchase, separately, the multi-fuel kit, which allows you to use white gas, kerosene, and other similar fuels (No alcohol though).  This is particularly useful if you're not sure what fuel you'll have and want some flexibility, or if you are trying to avoid the trash buildup of empty gas canisters, or if you are planning on cookng in particular cold weather and want a more stable and consistent fuel in dramatically changing temperature conditions.A small tip:  Primus sells several multi-fuel kits, for the older Gravity stove, the ETA Power EF/MF/SPider, but the kits are all essentially identical, only very different prices.  The ETA Spider multi-fuel kit sells for over $100, the Gravity multi-fuel kit sells for $55.  They're all the same.  The ETA Power EF kit sells for $75, I think.  There is one small differece.  The spider multifuel kit comes with a separate plate.  The ETA Power EF has the heating plate built into the stove, but the ETA Spider doesn't.  The heating plate is where you put a little of the fuel to pre-heat the copper rigid fuel ingress point.  This heats the fuel enough to catch and at least get flame out of the stove, and that flame coming out of the stove then heats the generator, making the fuel vaporize more efficiently.  But, i just fashion a small bowl out of aluminum foil.Interestingly, Primus now also sells the ETA Spider without the wind screen and pot, so you can just get the stove portion.  I'm not sure why anyone would do this because the stove has one small flaw, well, not a flaw so much as a slightly fragile design:Many liquid fuel capable stoves on the market today and many older backpacking stoves all need some way to pre-heat the fuel to vaporize it.  In days past, it was done through something called a ""generator"" or ""heat coil"" or ""heating element"".  All this really means is that the fuel line didn't go directly into the stove.  Rather, the fuel line connects to a brass tube that goes around the top of the stove to be pre-heated and vaporized before coming back around to send fuel into the stove fuel injection point.This is particularly true of Kerosene/diesel/parafin as the vaporization temperature is very high (which is also what makes it such a safe fuel), but applies to white gas and petrol as well (which has a lower flash point, and is therefore less safe, but also easier to deal with).  This is true of gas cansiter stoves including butane stoves as well, it's just less noticeable because the temperature where it needs pre-heating is so low, that under most 3 season camping conditions, it doesn't need pre-heating.That generator typically is made of brass because brass isn't as affected by heat as other metals.  However, while brass is very strong in resistance to temperature, it's very weak as a structural metal.  Brass is soft.  And unfortunately, since it needs to be above the flame, it needs to be completely exposed....soft metal...completely exposed...equals fragile.It was a genius design back in the day (though generators were always on any purchasable spare parts list), but if you look at the Primus Omnifuel/Omnilite, Optimus Nova+/Polaris Optifuel (I own and use all of these marvels), you'll see that the best engineering today gets rid off this weak link in backpacking stoves, instead building the pre-heating element into a short, hardened straight line tube, which draws heat not from the stove fire, but from the entire copper assembly, including the soot trap.  Which is why it's interesting that the ETA series, the pinnacle of Primus stove engineering, uses this older technology.Except for that one issue, which is less worrying since the stove assembly is always stored in the ETA Spider pot itself, the Primus ETA Spider is among the best stove setups I own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STDNMAORRKYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQLGXPW#wasThisHelpful","R1STDNMAORRKYV","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Good for cooking stews, beans, chilli, etc.  The top of the thermos can be used as a serving bowl, but most likely, when there's two people, you'd pour some of the food into the bowl for the second person, and you would eat out of the thermos.The integrated spoon is a nice feature as well.A simple hot water test kept the water hot for a several hours.  So long, in fact, that you could really use the thermos for lunch and dinner if you wanted to.  I imagine a scenario where you eat out of the top (serving bowl), for lunch, with half the food left in the thermos and capped to keep it hot, and then for dinner, you still have a hot bowl of food.  Not a bad setup if you plan on being out all day and might not get back to base camp in time for dinner.In typical Stanley fashion, the materials are solid steel, and built to last.  If you do decide to go this route, expect to use it for years on end, a lifetime product if ever there was one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32CBOWZEWKH4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCEVJOI#wasThisHelpful","R32CBOWZEWKH4Z","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one of a shrinking number of people who still uses the phone for voice calls a lot, all day in fact, there are many situations where the iPhone's mic and speakerphone just don't cut it.Small group meetings, or when I'm jumping around calls a lot in a hotel room, or trying to use facetime and being able to see and hear while the phone is at a distance are examples of when a speakerphone is ideal.The Jabra SPEAK 510 handles these situations perfectly.  I own two other battery driven, portable, blutooth audio conferencing units, and of the three, the Jabra Speak is by far the best.The other two units have 2 mics and 4 mics respectively, to help with audio management, and yet they pale in comparison (for the mic) compared to the Jabra Speak 510.  No unit of this size can be perfect, but the major challenge of all these units in terms of comfortable usability is not the speaker.  The speakers are fine on every unit I test.  The major problem is always the mic.I don't know what magic Jabra pulled on the mic, but it is the most usable and closest to an enterprise class deskphone's mic of any portable battery driven blutooth audio conferencing unit I've ever tried.The touch screen controls are fairly nifty, but again, as far as I'm concerned it's a gimmick and is no better or worse than push button models.The integrated USB cable is very handy though, and much appreciated.  Nothing worse than having yet another separate cable to manage.  and cable management itself is easy as well.One nice feature is that the unit can be plugged in to a laptop for power while still using the bluetooth mode.  Not all audio conferencing units have that ability.All in all, if you're looking for this type of unit, the Jabra Speak 510 is, in my humble opinion, the best of the lot.  It goes with me everywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31G9T9R44HZO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUO5RI#wasThisHelpful","R31G9T9R44HZO0","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little device.I'm relatively inexperienced when it comes to deep frying, and previously owned a technically more efficient deep fryer that was designed to work with less oil by using a slanted, rotating pan.  The problem with that model is that it has more moving parts and failure occurs more easily.  Once it broke, I decided to go with a simpler design with more controllable and parts that are less likely to fail.As complicated as this unit appears in the photo, it's actually a very simple design.  The components are: - The frame - The removable heating element - The filter included top cap (prevents oil splatter - The basket - The oil pan - The plastic drain underneath - The power cordEverything on this unit except for the heating element is a mechanical.For instance, in the photo, you see the larger dial on the front of the frame.  That dial mechanically moves a cap cover for the drainage hole underneath the main oil pan.  It isn't an electronic component, so is a reliable mechanism that could probably be futzed with if it ever starts to act wonky.The frame has various divets and edges that allows these other components to fit together nicely, but the units fit together rather loosely, without being over-engineered to unnecessary levels of precision.  That's a good thing.  This set might, over time, get a little messy, and being over-precise would cause problems later on.The only real concern I have is that the bottom plastic oil container is not made of very heat resistant materials, and it's questionable how long it will last, but time will tell.The simple fact that all these parts come apart so easily means that cleaning every nook and cranny of the unit, and doing so easily, is the most attractive aspect of the design.This unit is overkill for most homes, without question.  It's larger than more counter-top convection ovens.  But if you do a lot of deep frying, or want a unit that is great for parties and need something a little larger, this'd be just the ticket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODCLPB6YS4GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ7QFGM#wasThisHelpful","RODCLPB6YS4GG","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a personal user, I'm really not the right target market for this unit.Unlike the Synology 1812+ (an older Synology that I have), this QNAP is more expensive, has a lot more processing power, and a ton more RAM.Frankly, for home use, this unit is overkill and is more suited to an SMB environment with virtualization features not available on the older Synology 1812.  From a power (and price) perspective, this QNAP with i7/16GB outclasses the current Synology 1815+ by a wide margin as well.The Synology is fine for most NAS functions, but I had one glaring problem with the Synology 1812 that forever plagued me:  The inability to properly run Plex server as Plex is such a power hog.  Until I found this QNAP, I was running Plex for a couple of years on my computer since the Synology was not able to handle it.  Let me correct that a bit.  The Synology COULD run Plex server, but unfortunately, only up to a certain number of videos.  Beyond something like 200 videos, Plex quickly began to have problems.The QNAP, after uploading my entire library and refreshing the Plex library, can run everything smoothly and without any issue at all.  Part of this may be due to improvements in Plex for NAS environments.  But part of it is the sheer processing power and RAM of this QNAP device.I do plan to run a CRM on it as well, and also plan to use myQNAPcloud, which will allow simpler access to my QNAP files without futzing with port forwarding, adjustments on my firewall setup, or the need for DDNS.  There are a few CRM tools available to download to the QNAP, so I haven't decided on which to finalize on, but having access to it on my server will make life a little simpler.Another nice feature distinguishing this model of the QNAP vs. the Synology 1812+ is the small screen on the unit itself.  I can make adjustments and get networking information directly on the QNAP without having to run a serial cable, and that's a pretty powerful advantage.Finally, while I've never had any problems, I have heard about some issues with the Synology during a recovery that caused folks to lose everything, and that has me worried enough that this QNAP unit will act as my primary unit while the Synology takes a back seat as a backup unit.All in all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase and if you plan on using NAS application services requiring more power and RAM, would recommend this unit for simplicity and power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DMB8TIDB799/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0XRY7Q#wasThisHelpful","R30DMB8TIDB799","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally, I rate products based on quality of the product, and in this case, the quality of the product deserves 5 stars for what it is.However, in the rating description, 3 stars is a designation for ""It's okay"", and in this case, that's how I feel about the Livescribe flipbook.Some points of note: - The flip book is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  A flipbook, for me, should be a little larger, more in line with a coat pocket than a shirt pocket.  but that's a small issue for me. - the flip book notepads flip vertically, not horizontally.  This is something I like very much is the reason I purchased the flipbook. - The flip book notepads are perforate for easy removal of the sheets.  Okay, I didn't need that, but sure, I guess. - you can write on only one side of each sheet for all the page information to sync correctly.  That is a big oversight in my opinion.  I guess it ties a little to why i think the notebook should be spiral bound, but either way, there is an entire side to each sheet that cannot be synced and stored properly. - The flip book notepads are glue bound, not spiral bound.  This is the big nono for me and why it's just okay. - The flip book does not have any cords to keep the pen together with it.  This is a bummer.  What's great about the moleskin portfolio and the regular A5 portfolio for the spiral bound notebooks is the pen holder.  The fact that the flip book doesn't have one is rather disappointing.I genuinely wish the flipbook notepads were spiral bound.  It'd be easier to treat the notepads like permanent notepads and also flip back and forth between pages.  I can deal with everything else.All in all, since this is the only flip book style available, I'll deal with it.  But the issues I mentioned above make it ""okay"" rather than great.Incidentally, the A5 portfolio and spiral notebooks are awesome, and I'll continue to use them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381D3RXH1KWEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YKW9E8#wasThisHelpful","R381D3RXH1KWEP","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hahaha, I purchased this on a whim, cuz...you know....R2D2.This particular harness fits my dog great.  But attaching and removing the unit is a little more involved than simple harnesses.  Then again, it feels a little more secure too.  There really isn't that much to say about this harness.  It works, the straps are a hard plastic that seem durable, and there's a v-neck with floating mesh between the V to make neck line dig in a little less.All in all, and great little harness, neither neither super tough, nor super soft.

"I don't know much about headlamps. In fact, until purchasing this unit, the most expensive headlamp I owned was a cheap $15 Energizer headlamp purchased on a whim in the Lowe's checkout line that served me just fine for activities around the campsite.Not too long ago, though, I went on  back packing trip where I night-hiked.  The Energizer ran out of batteries before I finished, and visibility was particularly bad due to the tree canopy along the hiking trail blocking starlight and the Energizer just didn't have the power to see very far.In a quest to get a better headlamp without spending several hundred dollars, wanting a headlamp where I could change the batteries without removing the headlamp itself, and having a field replaceable battery setup (vs. Li-ion permanent install), I came across the Black Diamond Icon Polar.The Icon Polar is identical to the Icon, except that instead of wearing the battery pack on the back of the head, with a short power cord to the light, the Icon Polar has a much longer power cord and the battery pack can be worn inside a jacket or on a hip belt.  The primary reason for this is to keep the batteries warm when night hiking in the cold, hence, the name:  PolarSome random notes: - The headlamp unit and battery case are both waterproof. - The headlamp has flood and spot and also red - There is one button for spot, flood, and red. - Takes a bit of practice to switch between the three.  Spot and Flood switch when you double click.  For red, the headlamp must first be off, and then you depress the button and hold to switch to red.  I really think this would have been better with two buttons, but oh well. - Changing the light intensity is done by depressing the button and holding it.  When doing this, the light intesity gradually shifts from weakest to strongest.  The light blinks once when getting to the lowest or highest setting before going back gradually in the opposite direction. This is my favorite feature as it works for all lights, even the red light, which is something that I want to change intensity on fairly often.  At night when I'm in my tent, I need very little light and am more than happy with the bare minimum red.  When sitting around a camp fire with friends, I want a brighter red light.  Walking around the camp site, a lower flood light is generally more than adequate as it isn't as blinding to other campers.  When bear hanging at the end of the night and strong flood light is preferred.  And when hiking, high power spot and flood makes a big difference. - The battery case holds 4 AA batteries.  This is more than plenty for most things, though there's no doubt that an 8 AA case would have been better for long night hikes.In this price range, it's pretty normal to get between 200 and 300 lumens, and the Icon falls right in there at 200 lumens, which is plenty for the spot light to get reasonably far.  But the materials aren't all that great.  More expensive units using CREE LEDs have metal enclosures for both the headlamp and battery case, but one issue with the more expensive units is that they get very hot, and the batteries are typically rechargeable Li-Ion batteries instead of field replaceable AA or AAA batteries.  The closest competitor to this unit would be the Princeton Apex Tec Extreme, which also houses an external battery pack.  Its advantage over this unit is that it is a little brighter at 275 lumens, and the battery case holds 8 batteries, but there's no red light, and the spot and flood each only have two intesnity levels.  Because I couldn't decide at the time, I purchase both units, but it's pretty clear that the Black Diamond Icon Polar is the all around winner, with the Princeton Tec Apex Extreme wins if you're planning an 8-10 hour night hike, needing more intensity and don't want to change batteries along the way or during the rest of your camping trip (assuming you choose very high settings for most of the night).Both lights are decent for night bicycling, and hiking.  Both units have fairly durable powere cords, and both units are fairly bright.  If you're looking for some endurance, or looking to have the extension cord to keep batteries warm in your coat during a trip, either of these units will serve you well at under $100.  If you need more than 275 lumens, you'll have to pony up for the more expensive units.  Even the entry level lights in that upper crust start out in the $250 range, and some go up well over $1K.So if car camping, back packing, or general night time activities require a headlamp, you want the external battery pack (most peope don't) and you need a little more oomph than most headlamps provide but you don't want to break the bank, go for the Black Diamond Icon Polar.  You can't go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5VPT1Z7ZNY8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRQ0ENU#wasThisHelpful","R5VPT1Z7ZNY8T","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm both impressed and disappointed with different aspects of this light.  But overall, this will likely be my goto headlamp whenever I plan on long night hikes.Some random notes (good and bad) - The spot light is strong and even.  It's powerful, so much so that looking at close objects will be a problem.  Also, using it on a trail that is busy with lots of people will definitely be a problem as it is blinding.  The flood is actually a better light under these circumstances. - buttons and modes;  there are two buttons and they are underneath the light which takes a bit of getting used to.  The button on the right side is for flood and has high, low, and strobe.  The button on the left side is for the spot light and has high and off.  Not much flexibility and range here.  the low flood is still very bright. - no red light.  I love red light.  it protects night vision, and also doesn't blind other people while at the camp site.  sadly, this model has no red. - This unit takes 8 batteries, so if you run it on low spot, it should last you a long time.  I put in fresh batteries two days ago, and on low, it's still going strong.  I don't have the tools to measure brightness, but in my garage in pitch black, I can still see everything I could when I started the test (used Energize NiM rechargeable batters). - The housing for the batteries sucks....sorry, but just plain sucks.  I imagine this portion breaking soon.  It's basically the core framework to cradle the batteries and that's really it.  To help protect from water a bit, I'm guessing, there's a soft plastic cylinder capped on either end with rubber caps.  One of the caps has a hole that the cable runs through.  The pouch for the batteries makes the whole unit look good, but this whole setup has me very nervous.  Really not a fan of the battery portion. - Speaking of the battery pouch, there are two attachment options, which I do like.  The belt clip works well and is secure, and there's also a small clip to attach to a backpack or maybe a rope around your neck, or a hip belt.  Nice touches.CONCLUSION:All in all, this unit is ideal as a low cost light for night hiking and night biking.  The 8 battery setup is a definite benefit, so if you need a lot of run time, you won't find much better than this.But if endurance usage isn't something you're concerned about, it's not ideal for broader backpacking uses, especially since it has limited light setting ranges and doesn't have a red light (or blue light for that matter).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16JE54WTE8PXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5EASZ8#wasThisHelpful","R16JE54WTE8PXI","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Klymit XL, the Thermarest Prolite, a cheap Wenzel foam pad, and a Thermarest folding pad.Recently, I purchased the big Agnes Q Core SL, and had a chance to try it out.Some initial thoughts. - Inflating:  It inflates surprisingly fast for a 3.5"" loft sleeping pad.  But as a smoker, I do get a little winded.  Maybe take two minutes to inflate fully - Firmness:  When inflating to relatively firm state without killing yourself trying to max out pressure, the 3.5"" loft proves great when lying down, but there isn't much float when sitting on it.  This is true, of course, of many inflatable pads, but it's more noticeable with this unit because the loft is so deep. - Lying down:  The expression, floating on air, is an accurate one for all inflatables, but the Q Core SL epitomizes the feeling.  Almost like a waterbed, you really feel the wrap-around when not firmly inflated, and even when it is, it feels...well....just different. - Noise:  The X-Lite and X-Therm are both pads that I've tried out, and also have friends who own them.  Unlike these units, the Q Core SL material is much less noisy.  Not super silent, but the material has that ever so slightly rough feel that some nylon shoulder straps have, and this material doesn't make as much noise as the X-Lite/X-Therm - Side-sleeper:  Of all the pads I have, this is the best for side-sleeping.  The 3.5"" loft is amazing.  hips sink down enough, while still retaining loft, that my knees are more centered when side-sleeping.  Dunno if that makes sense, but imagine sleeping on a wooden floor on one's side, and the hip strain (over several hours) of the upper leg from being at a steep angle and you get the idea.  The loft on my other sleeping pads is much thinner making this the most comfortable pad I own. - The regular size, 20x72, is 18 oz with the bag (roughly).  the pad itself is 17oz (according to the manufacturer tag).  That is pretty damn light.  The long and wide (25x78) is 23oz without the bag.  I was sorely tempted to get the larger size and still might in the future, but that difference was significant enough that I went with the regular.  Also, when rolled up, the long and wide version is about a 1.5"" longer cylinder shape.  That difference is also noticeable in the pack, another reason to get the regular. - Edge seams/material:  unlike the Klymit, which has a super wide edge seam, the Q Core's edge seam is much thinner.  While the material is thinner and lighter than the standard Q Core (non-SL version), it still seems strong enough to hold long term.  I do still worry about it though.  The Klymit XL is something I don't really worry about, but the Q Core makes me a tad nervous. - Color:  I really couldn't care less, but it's a slightly darker orange than the Thermarest. - Cleaning maintenance:  The material seems relatively easy to keep clean.  I haven't used it backpacking yet, but most of the pad materials of the pads I own are fairly easy to keep reasonably clean, so it's not much of a concern.  The Pro-Lite is the only one that seems a touch difficult. - Warmth:  The r-value is fairly high, though I never put stock in those.  I can say for sure that the common drafty edges where I often feel cold aren't there with this pad.  I think it's because you sink in a little more on this pad, which makes the sleeping bag along the edges fan out more smoothly, helping to retain heat better, but regardless of the reason, there are fewer cold spots and cold lines on this than the Prolite Thermarest.  Given that the Klymit is really a summer pad with no r-value whatsoever, the Q Core will likely be my goto for most camping trips going forward.All in all, an impressive pad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IMZM2A482GSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PMD9KS#wasThisHelpful","R2IMZM2A482GSY","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great addition to the ETA Power EF.I've been a huge fan of the ETA Power EF, because of it's over-engineered fuel efficiency design, but it has one issue for me: the requirement to use gas canisters.  While i confess to loving the simplicity and efficiency of gas canisters, a part of me thinks that it's a good idea to use those less because recycling gas canisters is a pain and results in more trash.  I'm not a tree hugger, and don't want to be too drop-wise-and-bucket-foolish, but am happy to make simple changes that decrease my ""trash footprint"" a little.This product allows me to us the ETA Power EF with liquid fuels, and that alone is a huge deal for me.Liquid fuels are a bit of a pain compared to gas canisters, but that's okay.  Once you get used to the process, it becomes second nature.  You'll always be slower in setup and packaway than everyone else with their jetboils and msr reactors, but you'll also have a good group cooking setup and fuel that can function along a broader temperature scale than most gas canisters (some gas canisters have mixtures better suited to cold, but most have a fairly narrow temperature range)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D33ZJUV1C2EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J093V12#wasThisHelpful","R2D33ZJUV1C2EL","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Livescribe Sky 8GB is one seriously amazing note taking solution.In some scenarios, in some industries, you go to a meeting, and want to take notes on your smart phone or smart tablet, but there is a request for all such devices to be put away.There are numerous examples of such scenarios.  Like going to a secure facility and doing a walkthrough, and having to submit anything that can take a photo (basically any smart phone or tablet today.  Or going to a construction site where there is a requirement to put away such devices as folks want to make sure your attention is there and not in checking email or other non-related tasks during the meeting.For these situations, often, you want to take notes and digitize them quickly, but using a regular pen and notepad just won’t cut it.This is where the Livescribe series of pens come in.I haven’t tried the Echo, but I tried the Livescribe 3, and switched to the Livescribe Sky.Between the two, I’d recommend the Livescribe Sky for most situations, and the Livescribe 3 if you don’t need the pen to have it’s own standalone memory or really need OCR.In my use case scenarios, the Sky 8GB is an ideal fit.Here are some great features about it: - The internal memory.  This is a must have as there are situations where I won’t actually have a smart mobile device with me (turning it in at the entrance to a secure facility, or other situations) - When using the special dot paper (very cost effective notebooks sold by Livescribe) there are extra features accessed through “buttons” - When using the dot paper, the pen knows exactly which page was written to.  So, if you’re like me, you can take “live” notes on even pages, and then go back later after the meeting annotate and add special notes to the odd pages, and Livescribe always keeps the pages in the correct order. - The Sky can sync using BOTH wifi and cable.  So if you can’t access WiFi when right away, you can always sync later via cable.  The internal memory plays a critical role here. - The pen has a built-in mic and speaker, and can record to its internal memory. - The recorded audio also syncs to what is written.  So you can point to a word in your notebook and the audio jumps to the point that was written during playback.  Much like Soundnote (one of my favorite apps on the ipad) - The notepads come a variety of sizes with holders.  I tried the Moleskin and wasn’t a huge fan.  The A5 spiral bound grid notebook is awesome, and hopefully, the Flip notepad will work well also.  Looking forward to trying it.  There’s also full-sized college ruled notebooks.  All of these are extremely cost effective, and that is a powerful draw for Livescribe.Some things I don’t really like about the Sky - WiFi connectivity is slow to sync - No WiFi access if the SSID isn’t broadcast - No WiFi access if connection requires a guest portal - The mic, understandably, pulls in a lot of sounds you don’t want it to.  Sometimes distracting to listen to. - The Sky doesn’t sync with mobile devices and the Livescribe app.  ..- This means no access to the Livescribe OCR - The Sky forces you to use Evernote.  I’m not a hug fan of Evernote. - The Livescribe Sky needs bluetooth:  For connection to mobile device (like the Livescribe 3) and for bt audio - Which reminds me, the 3.5mm audio jack is cumbersome.Minor quibbles - The Livescribe Sky 8GB is not super comfortable to use.  The Livescribe 3 is much more comfortable. - The Livescribe Sky 8GB only has a cap.  The Livescribe 3 uses a rotating shaft that both controls power and the nub (a much more elegant solution).  The cap is easy to lose.  It really is designed to protect the nub and the recessed IR camera, but I wish there was a better solution there. - The display on the Livescribe Sky 8GB is a bit distracting because it projects that it is a computerized device.  Something more subtle would have been preferred.Notable Differences between pens - The Livescribe 3 has a bunch of internalized software, and works via Blutooth with mobile apps (Livescribe+) on iOS and Android.

"Over the years, I've tried a variety of screen protectors, some as part of a larger rugged case, and some that are pure screen protectors and nothing else.Most have one of four problems: - They make air bubbles a nuisance, making it easier to have it done by the store - Once on, they cannot be removed and then later re-attached. - They interfere slightly with the capacitive touch response - The sheen changes to look almost wetAnd then over course, there is the fact that many are ultra-thin.ZeroLemon saw another review I had written and offered to send me one in exchange for an honest review.While many might read this and think I've colored the review for this because of the free product, I've tested this quite a bit and am pretty happy to stand by what I write here.ZeroLemon has dealt with the issues listed above very well. - Air bubbles (none)  When removing the protective film from the ""sticky side"", I was immediately concerned that there would be air bubbles.  Surprisingly, there were none and the protective screen was easy to apply.  I think much of this has to do with the rigidity of the protector.  Normally, the flimsy screen protector is difficult to apply as it flaps around.  But the ZeroLemon, being relatively rigid, can be lined up easily, and then lightly applied from the corner.  You can see the protector gradually stick to the iPad mini evenly and gradually, and the thickness prevents any part from sticking too early (a common cause for air bubbles).  I found the application process to be very easy and smooth. - Once on, they cannot be removed and then later re-attached.  Another great feature of this screen protector is that it can be removed easily and the sticky screen protector, while attached firmly in regularly use, peels off very easily.  This is great if you want to change the screen protector out with a new one because it's scratched up, or make an adjustment, or remove it temporarily as you add the iPad Mini to a different case.  Love how the sticky film stays with the protector when removed it, and love how easily it comes off without damaging either the protector or the iPad Mini. - They interfere slightly with the capacitive touch response  This happens rarely with pure screen protectors, though it is not uncommon with cases than have a screen protector built in.  It was a bit of a concern for me because the ZeroLemon screen protector is very thick compared to the super thin screen protectors from other manufacturers.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the sensitivity of the screen protector's ability to maintain the capacitive touch properties of the iPad Mini with no degradation at all. - The sheen changes to look almost wet  Here again, I notice this more with screen protectors that are part of a case design, though it sometimes happens with pure screen protectors as well.  The ZeroLemon screen protector goes on so clean that there are no seeming wet patches anywhere on the screen.All in all, this is a very impressive product and I would recommend it to anyone seeking screen protection without a full on case.---If there was one request, I would like ZeroLemon to get with LifeProof to have LifeProof certify the screen protector for the iPad Mini Nuud case (which would normally require a separate screen protector).  While I'm fairly certain it would work without a problem, certification on the website would be a big boon.  The LifeProof Fre case screen protection is not that great, and the LifeProof Nuud is better.  But screen protection is a major issue there, and if the ZeroLemon screen protector was certified by LifeProof as compatible, I would be an even bigger fan for the best of both worlds.Great job ZeroLemon.  Until this product, I was dissatisfied with pure screen protectors, but now, am happy to use one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSUCOJLGBS75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLK2VJG#wasThisHelpful","R3BSUCOJLGBS75","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thermometer is meant for river currents, hence including the ruggedized casing around it.But that ruggedness is really great for backpacking too.There are a lot of tiny thermometers for clipping onto backpacks or keychains, but I find them too small, too short, to be able to easily tell the temperature, and wanted a much longer thermometer instead which is much easier to read.  But still didn't want to give up ruggedness since I'm pretty rough with gear.This fits the bill perfectly, and adds real value.  Sometimes the temperature drops and I don't really feel it at first, maybe because I'm hiking, or maybe my mind is elsewhere, or maybe sitting by the campfire.  Either way, my body temp starts to drop and I don't notice at first.  Just having this unit hanging from the shoulder straps on my backpack reminds me to check the temp once in a while and make sure the weather is right for my rough calorie burn at the time.Rugged, larger for easier read than mini keychain thermometer.

"Yes, this works well.  In fact, it makes the SVEA almost whisper quiet.But compared to other roarers, I'm realizing that the SVEA isn't that loud.  For other roarer stoves I have, the roarer is so loud that you can't really have a conversation when working at the stove.So have a muter makes a huge difference in making a compact camping area a fun and relaxing environment.  And that is worth the weight of the muter.Since the SVEA isn't that bad, I wonder whether the benefit of making the stove quieter is really worth the weight of the quietstove.It really depends on whether you have the SVEA and find the roarer disruptively loud.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV5EP9U7BFAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YOLCU6#wasThisHelpful","R2AV5EP9U7BFAJ","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great knife.  While it has unfortunately taken a back seat to another recent camping knife purchase, the versatility and durability of this knife is never in question.rub a drop of oil on either side every once in a while and you're golden for years and years.I know very little about knives and various kinds of steel, but for camping chores like splitting wood, hacking at smaller branches in gathering firewood, some kitchen chores, and using the pommel a bit like a hammer to get tent stakes in (with the sheath on for that last one, of course), it works just fine.Where this larger knife starts to feel a little clumsy in trying to do finer work.  Like skinning a small squirrel or chipmunk, whittling a point on a small branch to jerry-rig a tent stake, and similar finer tasks, this knife is just a little too heavy and large.  A 3"" blade is best suited for those types of tasks, though a 5"" can get you buy without much trouble.  7"" blades are just a bit too big.They are also not that great for hacking.

"You go backpacking and bushwacking and you don't have one?Some day, you might be out and about, and away from easy access to power, and you might need to get your bearings.  While using a military compass takes practice, there are videos about this for beginners and it's not overly difficult to learn the basics.  So long as you know roughly where you are, can match up some sited items to a topo map, you can use this to get to where you need to go.This units has tritium, which, while not bright enough to be a flashlight, is plenty bright enough to keep the dials lit constantly.If you're very new to compass bearings, it's probably a good idea to really memorize the tritium dials and practice basic measuring in the safety of your home, where you can turn the lights off and on as you practice and really get used to using the unit in the dark.In a situation where you are walking for a while, you might end up needing to walk partly into the evening after the sun goes down.  in this case, if you measured your bearings while the sun is out, this unit would allow you to keep going without as much concern.  It's a bit of set-it-and-forget-it for each point to point line.  You just stop and regular check your compass to make sure you're going in the right direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKU6IXMVYSVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W2CJX6#wasThisHelpful","R1KKU6IXMVYSVJ","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If alcohol fuel (and optionally, also multi-fuel) is your thing more than gas canister stoves, but you want to maximize efficiency with a really good wind screen, this set is very hard to beat.As the aluminum set that has not non-stick coating, it has a few advantages: - It heats up faster than the coated version. - Cools down faster than the coated version - It's lighter than the coated version - No worries about scratching the coating...cuz...there isn't any.It also has some disadvantages. - the coated version spreads heat a little better, mitigating hotspots (not much, but a little). - The coated version is easier to clean (until the coating wears thin....) - ....that's really about it.Technically, alcohol performance is reduced in colder weather, and while that's true of this unit as well, it stands up to cold much better than the Trangia alcohol stove with most other sets.  A little heating candle under the alcohol stove would help improve efficiency in freezing temperatures, but really, if you want to use this set in weather that is so far below zero that you need extra heat to keep the alcohol stove warm, you're better off getting the Trangia X2 and using white gas or kerosene instead.This set is overkill if you're traveling alone.  It's certainly back-pack-able, but there are plenty of smaller, lighter sets that can use a Trangia alcohol stove.It's ideal for one person who likes to do some fancier cooking, or one person who is dead set on an alcohol stove, but going to colder and windier areas.It's ideal for two people in any conditions.If you're talking about light eaters, than this set would be good for three people as well.It isn't an ultra-light by any means, but for the alcohol stove fan, this is a hard set to beat.---For me, this is ideal for two people, mostly because I'm trying to avoid using gas canisters whenever possible (within reason).  no matter how efficient gas canisters are, it's just too easy to go through a ton of those cans, and recycling them isn't easy.  Much better to use denatured alcohol, kerosene or white gas in larger tanks and just refill fuel bottles to mitigate trash.This unit, along with the optional Trangia X2, gives the most flexibility without resorting to gas canisters.Rock on Trangia, this design, among the oldest designs I've found so far, is a strong competitor to modern gas canister stoves offered today, a testament to a timeless design and quite the engineering marvel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9MUJYU9QZQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVE7Q5E#wasThisHelpful","RD9MUJYU9QZQ0","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This heat pouch isn't bad.  It does what it was meant to do, and it has the advantage of looking tough enough to last quite a while, but I didn't find it particularly convenient.Getting the Terra HE Weekend pot into this unit is, while easy, not very smooth.  For this reason, it's easy to spill some hot liquid while transferring the pot from a stove to the cozy.The velcro side is meant to allow you to placed the pot inside while the handles are sticking out.  Makes sense, of course, but again, the lack of smooth action makes it easy to spill.Now, if the liquid was thicker, like a past sauce, then there wouldn't be much of a problem, but the more splash prone the liquid, the hard it is to get in without some splashing.Still, like I said, once you get it inside, the cozy does work and keep liquids warm for a little longer.  Not a bad option if you have only one stove, cook in the pot first, move it to the cozy for a little while so you can do some other light cooking in the pan....of course, then you have an open top, so best to cover the pot with something while doing some pan cooking.All in all, it's better than nothing, but I think a DIY cozy works almost as well, takes less space, is lighter, and if made right, will allow the HE weekender to slide in a little more smoothly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GONI7J8GPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YEQP24#wasThisHelpful","R12GONI7J8GPY","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you use the Trangia 25 or 27 series, or if you use the Clikstand, and want the additional option of using liquid fuels or a gas canister, this is the way to go.First off, a correction:  While the thumbnail image shows the correct version of the Trangia multi-fuel stove, the main image on the page shows the wrong photo.Trangia changed their OEM at some point in the past from Optimus to Primus.This is an important change for two reasons. - First:  The previous generation Optimus OEM'd multi-fuel stove had two throttles for fuel, one on the stove side and one on the bottle side.  For fine tuning fuel, having two throttles is a little better, but this is not a huge deal. - Second:  The previous generation Optimus only worked with liquid fuels, but the newer Primus works with both liquid fuel and gas canisters - Sidenote:  the Primus version is louder than the older version.  They are both roarers, but Primus is notoriously loud, when compated to other roarers.  The Quietstove designed for the Omnifuel may work here, but hard to say for sure until properly tested.---The pump is the standard one that comes with the OmniFuel, OmniLite, and the multi-fuel setup for ETA stoves, and that's a good thing.Unlike pumps from MSR or Optimus, the Primus pump does not have an ""L"" shaped pump at the end, nor does it us  a plastic fuel line (which tends to reduce the effectiveness of the pressure release valve.  Instead, the Primus pump is metal, and a straight rod, and the thread portion of the pump to screw into the fuel bottle is angled.  This allows for a more reliable setup when releasing air pressure through the fuel line by flipping the bottle.  I also have another pump with a similar pressure release and fuel line clearing mechanism which is plastic, but it is not as reliable mostly because the plastic fuel line isn't always curved to the edge of the bottle.in addition, the fuel pump connection is a lindal valve, similar to gas canisters, which allows the fuel line to connect to gas canisters without changing adaptors.  Really love this setup.---According to some online information, the burner at the stove as been throttle back from 3000 BTU max output to 2000 BTU max output.This is a good thing.The Trangia 25 series and 27 series (at least the UL models), aren't really designed for a great deal of heat, probably because it was originally designed for the lower heat output of the Trangia alcohol stove.  As such, the X2 burner, without a throttle adjustment, could wreck havoc with a Trangia 25/27 at full power.Even then, I would take care when using the X2, to avoid doing anything at full blast.---The greatest area of concern for X2 heat output is when melting snow.  Without adding a little water to prime the snow for melting, there is a major risk here of damaging the pot because there is air between the pot and snow at the bottom.  A little water will remove the risk (at least dramatically mitigate the risk) of warping or cracking the pot.---The X2 comes with two bolt jets, one for white gas and one for kerosene.  Surprisingly, there isn't one for gas canisters.  So if you're going to use a gas canister, be especially careful to throttle down the stove to avoid damaging the pots or windscreen.  And use the larger of the two bolts.  The rule of thumb is:  the cleaner the fuel, the larger the jet gauge.---The stove heat shield is uniquely designed for a ""perfect fit"" holder for Trangia alcohol stoves.  Basically any round hole that allows the Trangia alcohol stove to fit without any gaps.  This is why this version of the heat shield is wider than the Primus Omnifuel's heat shield.It also has two bumps to help secure it to the rim.  A great little design innovation to prevent the stove from bad angles.---Though I have several gas canister, liquid fuel, wood, and alcohol stoves, it's become pretty clear that using gas canister stoves, if you go camping a lot, creates a lot of trash, and it's starting to be rather irksome to produce this trash when trying to be more green.For this reason, the Trangia 27 set, along with an alcohol stove is ideal in ensuring a reduction in trash.  Now, with the X2, it's possible to have much greater fuel flexibility for a variety of situations without resorting the gas canister fuels.---The biggest drawback to this unit is price.  And it's so expensive, it's worth docking a star.As Trangia OEM's this, it's clear that Primus doesn't give much of a reseller discount to Trangia, so Trangia must add its margin to this unit to sell it.  This dramatically increases the price of the unit and for most, it is cost prohibitive.Something really needs to be done here as a unit this versatile should be in the hands of every Trangia 25/27 or Clikstand Appalachian owner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNOSWASLI3UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S0FIIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HNOSWASLI3UG","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own quite a few of thee types of miniature gas canister stoves.  And this would have to be my second favorite of all.  It has some wind resistance from being blown out, which is nice, and the flame egress surface faces outwards to cover wider pots.  It is also well suited for small pots and any cup designed for this purpose.The heat output is also very high.  And it also fits in most cups designed to hold a 100 gram gas canister.Having said all that, it would really benefit from a wind screen/heat reflector.Currently, there is a wind screen being sold specifically for this type of vertically stacked stove, the Optimus wind screen.  I don't know yet if the pot stand tines are small enough to work with that wind screen, but if it does fit, and the setup works well, this may quikly become my new favorite.

"As stoves go, the Primus ETA Power EF is an incredibly over-engineered work of art, best suited for a heavy cooking car camping trip.While definitely not suited for a one person backpacking trip, it could be a great boon for a four person trip when distributing and sharing load.Having cooked a fair bit with pots, I've realized that a common problem with using a gas canister stove or multi-fuel stove with a larger pot is the development of hot spots, which makes consistent cooking rather difficult.There's really no easy way around it.  A small burner stove that naturally focused heat straight upwards, and the wide base of larger pots means hot sports.But Primus has done an admirable job of dealing with this issue (possible side effect of dealing with other issues).  It isn't perfect, but does better than expected.The pot has a much thicker non-stick ceramic coating than you see in other camping pots.  Primus says it's much more durable and with three meals with this under my belt, and many meals cooked with other pots, it certainly seems that way.  The thicker overall pot seems to spread the heat some, so the hot spot is naturally wider than in other pots.The heat exchanger also helps prevent hotspots as it evens out the overall heat disparity over the entire base surface.  Unlike some heat exchangers that only have the zigzag portion, the Primus has an additional exterior wall around the heat exchanger portion that seems to provide additional wind protection for even greater efficiency.The two combine to help mitigate the problem of a super high concentration of heat in one spot.When simmering, these hot spots spread out even further.  And heat goes up the sides a lttle too.For my first test meal, I tried a simple bean with chilli powder.  The plastic bowl comes in handy here to store the diced ingredients.  First cut up bacon and fried it up, being careful to keep heat low enough that nothing burned.  Next went the diced onions, to caramelize using the fats from the bacon.  After that went ground beef, to make it easy to crumble it up.  Next comes the sliced mushrooms and some herbs and spices.  Then went canned beans, water, chilli powder.  Let the whole thing mix up and stew for a while on a super low simmer for an extra 20 minutes.  After that, I placed the pot into the thermal case for an extra 20 minutes.  I learned in a water test that the thermal case really only helps when you close it all the way.  Too much heat escapes if the zipper is open, so you have to first place the pot into the thermal case, and then fold in the handles to completely zip close the case.  Something like this would really be great if it could stew for several hours, but this unit isn't really designed for 2+ hours of non-stop cooking, even on a low simmer.  It would go through fuel too fast.  Really pretty good.The second test meal is ideally suited to the ETA Power EF:  Pasta in cream sauce.  Boil water, throw in the pasta, strain the pasta using the built-in colander in the cap, add cream sauce to warm, serve....Stupid easy.The last test was to treat it a little like a pan.  First put in some half slices of bacon, once cooked, put them aside and then fried up some eggs, and finally threw in some loose hashbrown flakes. I wish there was a pan for this set though, since the long silicone spatual I had was rather difficult to use in the deep pot.In all three cases cleanup was the easiest I've ever experienced with a camping pot.  I have several non-stick camping pots and you often still get some carbon burn-in, which is a chore to remove with a soft sponge.  This is especially true when cooking bacon.  Not so with this coating.  It's so thick, it's much more like a home non-stick pot and pan set.Incidentlly, you can also use a camping kettle on this stove and it works pretty well.  the wind shield still works.----So, because of its over-engineering to really maximize the efficiency of fuel, the extra convenience of having the plastic bowl to store ingredients or move food around when making a more complex meal, I would say this pot is good for a group backpacking trip where gear is shared and there is weight distribution between members.  Since it's so easy to clean, it'd be okay on an expedition trip where you break camp every day, but really, it's best suited to base camping, from which you plan on having a few day trips.Either way, this is an amazing piece of kit for cooking for up to 4 people.  If that's your thing, go for it.Happy camping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU7KALPS2E0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4AGV68#wasThisHelpful","R2JU7KALPS2E0A","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[See bottom of review for update]-----When digging through the Optimus Hiker reviews, you'll basically see three types: - Those who have owned one for years, saw it on Amazon in the past few years, and wrote a review - Those who bought one in the last few years, and posted about shavings inside the tank - Those who bought one even more recently, complaining that it was ""used"", stll wet with kerosene, and the tank screws were loose or off.Focusing on the latter two, here's what I think is happening:  - Optimus saw people complaining about metal shavings in the tank and having to flush/clean/drain the tank, and decided to help. - Their current process requires EVERY Hiker Plus to go through the draining process at the factory before it leaves. - When properly cleared of debris, they run kerosene through it and test it, - They then apply the ""TESTED"" sticker - When they test the clean and test the tank and stove, they do not test it with the entire unit put together.  They test the stove and tank separately.  When they're done, they simply throw everything in the box, hence the screws are loose and get stuck on the magnet. - Since they cannot fully clear the kerosene from the inside of the tank, they package it up with a little fluid still inside, which can sometimes leak a little and coat the outside of the tank and maybe a little of the inside of the box. - Also, since the screws are loose, they tend to stick to the magnet designed to keep the stove in place when the unit is opened.----So, if you get one that looks used....it isn't.  Look for the ""TESTED"" label on the shield, and make sure you look for the screws around the magnet at the center of the box, below the stove.---Stunningly gorgeous.A great piece of history.All the other reviews I've read about this are accurate, but it's not until you actually see it, hold it, and futz with it that I really understood the sense of size of this unit.Basically it has the same depth as an old tin lunchbox so popular in the 70's and 80's.  If you take one of those lunch boxes, leave the depth as is, and just make it a lot less wide, that's basically the Optimus Hiker Plus.  When closed and laid flat, it is a tad taller than a lunch box.It really is a pretty small device compared to what it looks like.That tank only holds about 12 oz.But....c'moooon....who cares....It's a piece of history....And it's one of the most reliable longest lasting stoves you could ever own, with potential for decades and decades of use.I plan to use this regularly, and let it get beat up, gain character.oh yeah....I'm one happy camper.--------EDIT--------I've read a lot of reviews and done a lot of testing on this unit since the original review, and have some new comments on usability.One of the biggest complaints I read about for this unit is it's weak performance in windy conditions, even a slight breeze can have an adverse effect on heat efficiency.Yep, that is true.  Very true.The issue is that the burner plate is much farther below the pot stand than it is on other camping/backpacking stoves, about an inch or maybe more.  From a heat efficiency perspective, that's a ton of vertical space for a breeze to steal away heat.When using this unit, get it away from wind as much as possible.  I have a 9.5"" aluminum folding slate windscreen/heat reflector that wraps around the rear and sides of the Hiker+.  This works very well and dramatically improves heat efficiency, while also maintaining the size flexibility of using pots.That big vertical gap between burner plate and the bottom of the stove does have an advantage, however, and that's heat spread.  In many stoves, the hotspot (which causes burns at the very center of the pot) is very significant.  Now, that's true of the Hiker+ as well.  But that hotspot radius is much wider than in other stoves because the roarer plate (some call it the splash guard plate) pushes the flame outward from the center, so the larger the vertical gap, the wider the diamter of the hot spot.Another great aspect of this unit is the sheer range of simmer control.  The Hiker+ has a very broad throttle range and that makes simmer control ideal for low heat stews, pastas, beans, chilli, and other wet foods.  In fact, if you have a small dutch oven, that can work on this too, the simmer control is that effective.In a longer term test, I can boil a kettle 32oz at about 45 degrees to boiling in about 7-8 minutes on full throttle using the folding windshield/heat reflector along the rear and two sides.  That's not bad at all.Also, in simmering a stew, I was able to get about 2.5 hours out of the tank easy and might have been able to get more if the tank was full.  Of course, I had to redo the pump a few times, but that's to be expected.Having used this now 37 times, I have to contradict some more pejorative reviewers.  The hiker+ is an incredibly reliable, consistent, and flexible stove and among the lowest maintenance of all my liquid fuel stoves.  I think only the British Army Cooker No.12 requires less maintenance, and that is probably the best endorsement I could ever give liquid fuel stove.If you're in the market for a camping stove, and want something small and uber reliable, it'd be hard to go wrong with this one.Happy camping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHGUYJ57GZ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042Y7562#wasThisHelpful","RAHGUYJ57GZ2X","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is probably great for rabbits but for squirrels, the steel gauge is too thick and the wire doesn't hold very well.

"Works really well.  Blade refills are strangely expensive to many other disposable things.Compared to a lot of other razoers, the ProGlide seems shallower in angle.  But for shaving coarse hair, you really need to shave more frequently, because a 3 day growth shave gets clogs this quickly.  The vibrating version of the razor, designed to shake up the hairs for a closer shave with less movement, also helps to clear the blades from clogs under running water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GN7RWT97PFRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A119HEI#wasThisHelpful","R2GN7RWT97PFRN","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What was I thinking....I was seeking a new sheath for my esee 6.

"I was expecting this is be smaller than it actually is.While it's still small enough to fit in a backpack, I wouldn't have minded if it was smaller.  Still great for a little sit down.

"A lot of reviewers have mentioned that this unit is wobbly.I decided to purchase anyway, because the price was right and also because I needed all the exercises to face the same direction so I could put it up against the wall in my garage, and was pleasantly surprised.Maybe I was just lucky, but I found the unit very stable.The is one subtle quirk.  The two handle bars that stick out with the pads for the forearms are tilted every so slightly.At first, I did it closer to the way it looks in the photo, with both tilted slightly inwards, but I found it felt perceptibly cramped.  So I switched them and now they tilt every so slightly outwards instead, and while this may make no different as the tilt is so subtle, just that little bit gives me a sense of more space with a feeling that the vertical handles won't hit my sides as I jump down from doing chin-ups/pull-ups.Also, while I followed the instructions in assembling it from the ground up, I actually tightened all the screws from the top down.  This may or may not have helped make everything fit better.  I dunno.  But either way, it feels very rock solid and stable.All in all, for the price, it really can't be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396NILEY64017/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M29CCI#wasThisHelpful","R396NILEY64017","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
