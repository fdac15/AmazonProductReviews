"I bought this set of bulbs to use above my kitchen table. They throw off a nice color, close to incandescent, but they have a serious drawback.If the bulb is inserted in a light fixture with the orientation as shown in the picture (threads down, lens up) then the bulbs do not produce a very strong light below the light fixture.  I pulled out my light meter and metered the illumination above, to the side, and below the bulbs to prove what I was seeing with my eyes.  Most of the light, by design, goes out the side and some up due to the lens, but little light goes downward.  This is most likely due to the fact that the lighting LEDS are blocked from downward illumination due to the base blocking illumination in addition to the LEDS orientation.I ended up reinstalling some of the original incandescent bulbs, every other one, to allow me to get enought downward light to actually read something on the kitchen table. I had high hopes for these bulbs but the design needs to change somewhat to allow light projection below the lens assembly.  Some other manufactures that I've tried had the LEDS point at a 30 degree downward angle to compensate for this problem, too bad this company did not.The illumination looks nice, they dim down to about 15%, but I'm not impresses overall with using them as a total replacement for incandescent due to the base blocking downward illumination.The search continues.....","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXML2P65SWE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ6HNE8#wasThisHelpful","R2PXML2P65SWE8","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice 12v DC red LED strobe light.Most of the light is thrown out of the top of the lens as this is the direction that the LEDs face. You would still be able to see the illumination at night from the side if mounted on the overhand of your home but during the daytime it probably would not get your attention unless it could be mounted so the brightest portion of light (through top) would be facing you.The unit includes a base that can be attached to whatever flat surface you are using and then the light assembly attaches to the base.Since this is a LED fixture the predicted life span should be a very long time.DIMENSIONS:2 and 1/2 inch diameter1 and 5/8 inch heightPROS:- Very bright and intense light throw directly through the top of the lens (even visible during daylight)- LEDs are long lasting so it should last for many years.- No moving partsCONS:- Poor light illumination through the sides of the lens (some of the LEDs should have been directed at the side of the lens to increase viewing angle) for daytime viewing- No rubber seal for direct exposure to water","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFYQAMB1W2P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIFHAPC#wasThisHelpful","R3IFYQAMB1W2P8","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE: This Model is for the INDOOR ONLY USE (dry environment)--- If you need outdoor look at the other model.I've been looking for ways to cut my electric usage as my electric utility tell me that I use more electricity than my neighbors. Using LED bulbs is cutting my usage as well as my electric bill.I first tried the 2700K version of these bulbs but found them to be way too dim compared to the 75 watt bulbs they were replacing. So in order to get a better range of illumination I upped the color to the next step being the 4000K bulbs.The 4000K bulbs really made a big difference compared to the 2700K bulbs in the range of light of illumination. The 4000K color though does cast instead of a yellow color, like standard incandescent light bulbs, a white light closer to the florescent light that you get from an office light fixture. Illuminates well but takes a bit of getting use to.I like the lights but wished that instead of 4000K they were a bit yellower like say 3500K instead. I guess I'm just use to the yellow light from years of experience with them. The bulbs also look funny when they are not working. Looks like yellow segments under the lens, but when they illuminate the light output is white.I wish the price would come down. I paid about $41 each for these lights and now I just need to make sure I get my money's worth. Now though, when a cat walks through my yard every night I won't complain as much about the energy usage.PROS:- Very bright in the 4000K version, 2700K version was rather dim compared to a 75w incandescent- Good illumination- Saves on the electric bill- This version of bulb is for INDOOR use (has vent holes around base and on side of unit where water would enter if used outside)CONS:- Light output is more like a florescent light color in an office- Price per bulb is high- Not attractive looking for a home or environments were autistics would be a concern","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4IZ3Q47YCW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AY9A30E#wasThisHelpful","R1X4IZ3Q47YCW7","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 4000K color though does cast instead of a yellow color, like standard incandescent light bulbs, a white light closer to the florescent light that you get from an office light fixture.  Illuminates well but takes a bit of getting use to.Funny thing is that my solar light fixture in the back yard always turned off when the incandescent light turned on but with these new bulbs installed the fixtures are not responding to the light being shined on them so they stay on too.

I just bought 2 more for another flood light fixture that I have for the front yard.  Last summer when we had a power failure and I had a standby generator running I had the backyard set installed and they even worked with the low voltage brownout we were having at 80v instead of the normal 110v.  I'm really liking the LED lights as my cfl bulbs wouldn't turn on with the lower voltage but these guys worked great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5CWJCC5SF2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFLZTVS#wasThisHelpful","R2H5CWJCC5SF2J","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I worked for an alarm company we use to try all kinds of brands of batteries.  Many brands were garbage and as a serviceman I was able to tell how cheap it was by the lead weight in them.Commercial accounts, under maintenance agreements, always got the best equipment.  If we had to go back yearly we were wasting money on replacement equipment and in paying employees wages for free service calls.  Yuasa was our number 1 brand.  It tends to cost more than the other brands but the life expectancy was the longest.  Residential customers got whatever was the flavor of the month per the company.  They paid us for the service call and for the battery on a 100-150% markup.  Most generic batteries would last 1-3 years whereas some of our Yuasa's were going strong at 5 years.As with most alarm batteries, if your power is out for an extended period of time, be sure to unplug the battery before it dies completely.  If you drain it dead it won't recover - the cells will be permanently damaged.  Leave the alarm box wide open so you remember to plug the battery back in when the power returns though.PROS:- longevity if not cooked by charging circuit- quality lead acid- not likely to leak or swell up unless cooked by charging circuitCONS:- tend to cost more than other brands","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I5TBJI2VRT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MA6FYG#wasThisHelpful","R17I5TBJI2VRT1","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a ton of home automation stuff throughout my house.  Kinda like a hobby seeing what I can do next.  I bought this unit to replace an older unit that died on me around Christmas.  It was imperative to get my system back under control from a hand-held perspective.  My computer does most of the work but we manually use a wireless controller to turn on Christmas lights in the bushes or the tree if we want them on before the scheduled time.  Gott keep the wifie happy.  When the old unit died, after 10 years or so, we knew we had to get another.  X10 is an older technology which has been replaced by z-wave and others.  Problem is that the new technology costs a lot more than the older X10.  In time I may switch but for now since everything is working fine I'm satisfied with X10 running landscape lights, decorations, tree lights, garage door alert, dryer alert, etc.PROS:- work well with handheld remote- allows wireless devices to interface with hardwiredCONS:- nothing lasts forever","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SB3DY4TUCZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BT7XUK#wasThisHelpful","R38SB3DY4TUCZI","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After doing a lot of research and looking at the construction of the various speakers, as well as my size requirements, I decided this was the speaker to get for my center channel.  We all know that the center channel is the most important speaker since it will basically provide us with the voices in movies and direct-on sound effects.  You don't want to go cheap on the center speaker.I've been using this speaker now for months and love it, love it, love it.  The sound it produces is true and clean.  Since my 55"" TV is on a stand, instead of being mounted on the wall, I tried to put the speaker in front of the TV but autistics and the fact that the top edge of the speaker blocked some of my view of the bottom edge of the TV, I instead placed the speaker right behind  the TV.  The speaker is in the darkness behind the TV yet it sits on the stand centered behind the TV unblocked due to the design of the TV.  The sound is astounding from this speaker.  I'm thinking about buying another one to replace the one I have upstairs.PROS:- attractive design- perfect size not too big and not too small- awesome sound and clarity at high volume or low volume- no complaints from the wifeCONS:- none to date, I'll edit this review if I have any","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RPI77X65CBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JCSG2Q#wasThisHelpful","R14RPI77X65CBN","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a side sleeper and I was in need of a firm pillow.  Another problem I have is that I roll from my left side, to my right, and then back to my left throughout the night.  This so far is one of the better pillows I have found so far.  While I haven't found any pillows like the firm ones they use to sell in the late 80s and early 90s, this has been one of my better bets.  I still need to flip it nightly as my head crushes it down throughout the night but this seems to do the trick.I currently sleep with 2 pillows under my head.  A thin one on bottom and this one on top of the thin one.  I tried using 2 of these but then my head was bent up in the air too much and it gave me a stiff neck.  Save one of your worn thin pillows to put under this one and this should do the trick.PROS:- one of the firmest pillows I've been able to find for a side sleeper- flipping the pillow nightly does the trick- has retained its shape, have had now for a few monthsCONS:- using 2 of these pillows under your head will surely give you a stiff neck- 1 pillow was not high enough, I had to use a thin pillow under this one to get the right height.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMTS3A1NBFQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002EXEFW#wasThisHelpful","RNMTS3A1NBFQJ","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit has an analog needle that responds to electronic noise fields.  You can get the same results with an old AM radio except you won't see a needed move or a blinking red light turn on to tell you there is electrical noise in the area.I tried using this unit to see if I could hear the transmission from my new Smart Electric Meter which the power company installed when I wasn't home.  To my disappointment the only thing this was able to pick up was the noise from the electricity which could be heard anywhere along any power wire that has a device drawing power on it.  If you are looking for something high-tech, this is not the device. Save you money.  The ones you are looking for cost $200 and up.PROS:- small- not expensive- has blinking red light that will illuminate when you are picking up  electrical noise along a wire with a load on it- has a speaker that provides a buzz to let you know you are by an active AC current draw- has a high and low setting (probably a resister inside)CONS:- meter is analog, no digital display.  Reminds me of a kid's toy from the 70s- only hears the noise along an electric line with a draw on it- can get the same results, minus the red light blink and needle movement, by holding an AM radio in your hand and moving it along an electrical line under load- not worth sending back","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTVFL3MQXE1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013P6ZJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PTVFL3MQXE1W","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I saw these straws I though I found the perfect match.  They were advertised as 9"" x 1/2"" which was going to be an inexpensive alternative to the 1/2"" plastic sleeves I needed for my mechanical pencil vending machine.  If they were actually 1/2"" I could slide the mechanical pencil into the tube and it would then be able to roll out of the vending machine.  However when they arrived I found them to be about a 1/16"" shy of 1/2"" which meant the mechanical pencils would not fit.I know I didn't buy the straws for the intended purpose, but I was counting on the vender actually making them to the size specs mentioned which would have saved me dough on buying tubes from another source.  Now I've given them to the wife for her to use for crafts or in the kitchen.PROS:- would make a good straw for shakes or smoothies- plastic is heavy and should not collapse when you such up your drinkCONS:- the dimensions are not true to what was described.

"Just perfect for the upper bunk of a bunk bed. It came in a box that was light and easy to carry inside. All it took was one swipe to open the box and the mattress literally sprung out. I was worried it would have the bend in it after being rolled up like that, but I haven't noticed any damage to the mattress at all. It's very comfortable to sleep on, too, which is nice for guests that stay over.

"I have been purchasing Otterbox for all my phones since back in the day. I have come to really respect the name and trust the product. I have not been disappointed to date. The defender case is my favorite but has gotten bulky on me lately so I decided to try a slimmer version. The commuter case is just the thing for my needs. Not only is the two tone purple very stylish, it is very well made, too. I love the slim fit in my hand and can easily slide it into/out of my front or back pocket if/when needed. Dropping it, I haven't noticed any nicks, cuts, dents, etc. and my iPhone is completely sound. The only thing that worries me is not having screen protection that I can see like on the defender case. However, I can clearly see a nice lip all the way around my phone to protect the screen from a fall.

"While the Celtic design is indeed beautiful, this particular necklace looks like someone took a button and attached it to a dainty but cheap looking chain. I had expected a much more gorgeous necklace from the picture alone and was disappointed with what I received. So if you are judging solely by the picture, you will be disappointed. However, upon closer inspection you will notice that the metal is solid and the chain sturdy. When worn, it changes a little (depending on what color you contrast it with) and looks prettier. It's a pretty piece but not a gorgeous chain and pendant. I wouldn't purchase it myself - thus the three stars - but someone else might find the quality and look worth it.

"I generally use much higher thread count sheets, but this one is perfect for anyone. The lower thread count should mean poorer quality, but that's not the case. I'm very impressed with the lightness and feel of the sheets. They aren't as soft as some of mine, but goodness for 200 count they are SOFT. They are also very well made. You can see the weave is a little different from normal sheets making it softer and a little more strong, I believe.

"Having recently lost two friends to cancer, and two others fighting hard, I had to have this bracelet. I'm so happy to have selected it. It is absolutely gorgeous. It was a slight tight but has a tiny little hinge in the back that you can almost see in the picture. This allows you to ""open"" the bracelet enough to fit over your hand and slide onto your wrist. It's an infinitesimal amount of movement, though, before it feels like you'll break it if you try any further. It doesn't open enough to slide directly onto my wrist, if that helps at all. Smaller persons would have a much easier time sliding the bracelet on and off than I did.There aren't too many crystals on it, just on one side of the ribbon, but it's enough to make the bracelet look stylish. Actually, with more, I think you'd lose the true nature of the design. It looks like someone tied a ribbon to a flowing piece of material that starts with Hope and ends with peace/healing in whatever form. Priced currently at $30.73 with free Prime shipping, I'd say it's a perfect gift for those with family members or friends fighting -- or the fighters themselves. It's enough that I'll be purchasing four more for my friends. This one I'll keep and wear with hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIKDM9WW0IFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2WTBPE#wasThisHelpful","R3GIKDM9WW0IFH","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may be that I'm just not familiar enough with it or that it's too new. I've used these personal training for boxing, mixed martial arts and cross fit. They give a great work out so when I saw this particular one I got really excited. However, the ones at the gym are more pliable, durable and less solid. Granted they are older so it might just be that this has to be used a whole lot more to get comfortable with, but as it stands now, I can't get a good hit in without messing up somehow.

"Somehow these are so much better than free weights. I use them with my personal trainer and love them. It gives you the right amount of resistance (depending on which band you use) and will have you sweating off the pounds in no time. My PT stated that they are high quality bands that will last a long while. Having them in their own carry bag allows me to toss them and take them on the go - working out any time/ any place. Definitely a great investment. And since they go with the amount of strength you have, there are no cumbersome and dangerous dead weights to worry about the kids getting into. Granted, these are not toys, but dropping one on your foot will not cause great pains. Linking the bands to the handles is a breeze. All in all a great product that I'm very pleased with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCRBG58WAI9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154C3XSE#wasThisHelpful","R1LCRBG58WAI9Z","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHOLLY MOLEY! This baby can shred like nothing else. I had no issues with paper jams, gummed up cutters or anything else. Having the basket pull out is awesome, too, because you don't have to deal with leavings fluttering around you as you lift the top. You will get some dust and leavings when you remove the basket but a little swipe can wipe it all up. It can take stapled pages, too. The only thing I noticed is 18 pages is pushing it to work harder so I cut it down to no more than 10 at a time. It seemed to handle that really well and continued consistently without shutting off from overheating. I had a lot to shred and was impressed that I didn't have to take any breaks. I would highly recommend this for heavy personal office use. I'm glad I came across it. I'd also recommend it for small libraries and businesses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DB5JB1X0XMQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNP06Y2#wasThisHelpful","R3DB5JB1X0XMQQ","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"VTech is AMAZING! I love this little guy. He's so stinking cute and has the sweetest voice to encourage little ones to give crawling a try, or to crawl around after him. He's also great for toddlers just learning to walk. His soothing voice and words will make any little one want to follow him around. Best of all, he's not annoying! He sings little songs and is all around the cutest toy for a baby shower, first Christmas, etc. Recommended age by manufacturer is 6 months - 36 months, but I think you could start much earlier than that and certainly older preschoolers would get a kick out of it, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V889FFMHMUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZU7D8#wasThisHelpful","R15V889FFMHMUV","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Wireless printing has come a long way and I love that I can print from any device in the home so long as it has wireless capabilities. It's an easy set up into your home network, too. The ink is about the same as other epson ink. No improvement there on pricing. Still and all, this is an excellent little printer. I'll continue to monitor it.

"Okay, so I'm not sure exactly where to begin. I am actually a little shocked this book made it out without an uproar. I personally did like it. It wasn't a favorite, but it was definitely well done. Imagine if society become a bunch of religious zealots and you were forced to pay a tithe. What if demons roamed the streets looking to take your soul and the only thing between you and them was the church and its band of exorcists? I found the story to be moving in more ways than one. However, I think many religious people will find extreme offense to this book. It makes  me a little nervous for the author because you can clearly read what religions she is attacking.

"Finally something that truly is waterproof in material. You can wash it on a gentle cycle and tumble dry low. It zips fully around the mattress and any padding you might have on it up to 14 inches. The smallest sized mattress that will fit well is 9"". Everything was great until I tried zipping it up. The mattress that I was putting into it still had plenty of room. It zips almost all the way down from one side to the other, so you slip the mattress in like a sock. Pretty cool, right? Not. As I zipped it closed around the mattress, I noticed that the zipper wasn't sealing very well at all. In fact, gentle pressure against the zipper split it wide open. Granted it is waterproof on both sides, but having a zipper break on you - thus exposing the mattress on the interior- negates the whole waterproofing thing. It felt well made, it just failed at being zipped closed.

"First, don't let the pictures scare you. Yes, this is a white nail polish but it comes out so much better than what the picture represents. I went straight to the manufacturer's website to see how they recommend application. There is a video on their site that goes over the four steps to gorgeous shiny white nails. This lacquer is only the second step. It will go on matte looking until you add a shiny overcoat. It's really easy to apply. Mind you, it's a little thinner than regular nail polish so it does require two to three coats to make nails look even. The awesome thing about having white nails is you can apply whatever decoration to your nail for an awesome pop. For instance, picture a deep red flower placed at the base of each nail with leaves going side to side. Instead of seeing color first, you see the flower first. There are a ton of other colors and each bottle is priced well. This particular product is currently $6.00 with Prime Shipping. Not bad considering how much a manicure can cost you (and that's just a one time thing!). I love that you can apply this as much or as little as you want for different looks. Oh, and the video is phenomenal on how to apply this particular one. You make an arch first - sweep to the right from center and left from center then bring down the center for a nice even look.  From the manufacturer's website;Probelle nail polish consists of a thin formula regulated to adhere to the nail plate evenly for a long lasting manicure. Light colors will require 2-3 coats whereas dark colors will require 1-2 coats, depending on the user. Why the thin formula? This nail polish formula is specially formulated to hold onto the nail plate for a longer lasting manicure. It is recommended to use Probelle's Hydrating Base Coat and Top Coat Sealer to guarantee longer lasting manicures.Top Quality, High gloss, Long Lasting Nail Lacquer.DBP, Toluene, and Formaldehyde Free.Directions: Gently shake bottle and apply 1 or 2 coats of nail lacquer to reach desired finish. *The use of any of our base coats is recommended for a longer lasting manicure.Size: .5 Fl Oz/ 15 mL","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEE0COS6A6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMR5FAE#wasThisHelpful","RTEE0COS6A6G","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read other titles by the author I am a bit jaded on my opinion. I expected so much more out of the novel than what was given. And maybe that's why I can't give the book anymore than three stars. It was okay. You have your typical family curse where everyone seems to die in mysterious and often times horrible ways. The wedding where the bride has much to hide from those around her - especially the Press who would love to feed into the hype of family curses and her fiance who is a fantastic catch (heir to a fortune). It is the wedding of the century with the predictable twists and turns that brings a lot of light to shine on the secrets surrounding the families within the pages. Since it's so predictable to say anymore would fully give away the story, and we can't have that. If you've read some of the Author's other works, you might be disappointed like I was. However, the Author is a good writer and thus those who haven't yet been introduced to the writing will find the story to their liking, possibly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVQSEOPPGA4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062259539#wasThisHelpful","RVVQSEOPPGA4L","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What if you were born into a society where absolutely everyone was deaf, including you? Gazing at the world around you with eyes that can see, but ears that cannot hear? Fei has never known what it's like to hear the sound of anyone's voice. The society she is raised in puts value only on those who are gifted with sight and can create news, art, etc. with true artistic ability. Those who are not gifted, are sent to the mines to work until they are blind - then become beggars on the street until they die from illness and/or malnutrition.When Fei's sister begins to go blind, Fei begins to panic. Orphaned when their parents were forced to work in the mines until losing their sight, Fei is determined to keep her sister out of them. It is a daily struggle to remain at the top and receive just the right amount of food to stave off hunger. Miners receive much less and beggars none at all unless someone chooses to help them. To be artistic is life. Death is for those who are no longer ""useful"" to society.Then one day Fei begins to hear sounds in the most peculiar way and the book really takes off. The mystery of why the people of her village lost their hearing generations back and why some fall ill and lose sight becomes very clear. War breaks out and Fei must learn to tap into her inner strength to protect those she loves.This is a teen fantasy, so the normal unrequited love, love triangle, teen angst exists throughout the pages but doesn't detract from the perfectly woven story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z55PVNBTONFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147632#wasThisHelpful","R2Z55PVNBTONFH","A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wholly smokes! This wireless light (that won't work until you install the required amount of D batteries *insert sheepish grin*) is AWESOME! Aim it with the idea of what kind of lighting you want on your face. Deer caught in the headlights is not a pleasant setting when you are walking down the hallway in the middle of the night. The motion sensor is sensitive - which I happen to love. I've fallen, tripped and stepped enough times with the pets  and kids in this house that I'm very thankful for a light that warns me of danger lurking in front of me - but don't want to be blinded either. I'm buying a couple more (despite the price tag) to sit outside by the trash cans. Installation is so easy I do not require any help at all. I'm hoping the brightness of the lights will deter the wildlife from digging for trash treats around the home. Especially the skunks that like to stink up the neighborhood on trash pick up day. I'm mounting them at just the right height to blind them as they climb up on the trash cans. If that doesn't work, I am not sure what will.

"I love plaid, it's one of my all time favorite patterns to wear. So naturally I love this pattern. I ordered it in the red cause red plaid is my favorite, and is kind of classic. The color is spot on. As for shipping this sgipped out fairly fast and arrived without any damage to the item or the package itself.The shirt itself is very comfortable and admittedly at first I wasn't sure why it was called a boyfriend shirt however I understand now. It's because it's a little bigger so it kind of gives you the feeling your wearing your boyfriends shirt. At least that's how I see it. It is extremely comfortable and I have slept in it more than once already. It's great for so many things too, wearing out and about, or just lounging around the house. It seems to be very well made, with no loose or missing thread, and with a nice consistent pattern. I might have to buy a couple more once I start getting a little bigger with this pregnancy cause I know they will be comfy to wear.

"Who doesn't love the freedom of swinging through the air, watching the ground blur by beneath your feet? Every little kid deserves a swing in the yard to experience this joy. One thing I'm not a huge fan of are the gaudy plastic modern swingsets.This wooden swing from Greta Fox is a nice change. It's made for children from infants up to toddlers of about 3 years. It comes completely pre-assembled, you just have to untangle it a bit directly out of the box. It's constructed completely of wood with a sooth, natural finish. The wooden beads on the sides are brightly colored to add interest for curious little minds. The overall look is classy and nostalgic.The swing has a solidly built wooden seat surrounded by supporting bars and straps that hold your child firmly in place. The wood and other components are non-toxic which makes them safe for little ones who think everything belongs in their mouths.The swing hangs by sturdy ropes that are threaded through each corner. We found it easy to install, though you will have to buy your own hanging hooks separately. Once installed properly, I feel the swing is extremely safe and well-constructed and will hold up to vigorous use. We chose to use it outdoors but it can also be hung inside just make sure your child will have plenty of room to swing without hitting anything.I have received complimentary products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2QLOSJUNMMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJJWRIA#wasThisHelpful","RN2QLOSJUNMMU","A2DSKXV7IWE25B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DSKXV7IWE25B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This watch is so lovely. In a time when people barely wear watches, these are irresistibly pretty. The band is a solid metal of gold color. It snaps open and closed at the side. The watch face is surrounded by a ring of delicate white crystals. Each side of the watch face is festooned with clusters of creamy pearls in a seed shape.

"I bought these for my husband in both the 'DARK NAVY' and the 'DARK PATINA'.SIZING: My husband wears a 38 x 31, so, figured I would have to order a 32"" inseam and have them hemmed, (like we did before), but, after reading the Reviews saying these slacks run long now, I took a chance on ordering him a 38 x 30, and they are a perfect length for him; thus, they do run long. So, take this into consideration when you order.COLOUR: The 'Dark Navy' is just that... a lovely colour. However, the 'Dark Patina' looks in the online photo like a beige... I figured maybe a light khaki... but no. Not only are they neither beige, nor khaki, but a kind of mousy-brown with gray-green undertones. Not a colour for him at all, so returned those.The FIT, (and the FABRIC that drapes beautifully), is fabulous... he LOVES the Savane brand. He's worn 3-pair for the last 10-years! So, we definitely got our money's-worth. These slacks are easy to care for, they keep their crease, and no ironing or steaming is required... wash them, dry them, hang them, wear them.

"First of all, let's deal with the SIZING because it's a definite issue with this Robe.Here is the Sizing Chart they give: AND DON'T YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF IT!!!*Small/Medium: Will fit Chests 32-38 inches, Robe length 46 inches*Large/XL: Will fit Chests 40-44 inches, Robe length 48 inches*1X/2X: Will fit Chests 46-50 inches, Robe length 50 inches*3X-4X: Will fit Chests 52-58 inches, Robe length 52 inchesI'm a 1x all-day-long. I weigh 160-lbs, am 5'3"" tall, have a 48-D bust, 40"" waist, and 50"" hips. After reading all the Reviews here, (and taking SPECIAL NOTE of the complaints about this Robe being HUGE), I ordered mine in a Small/Medium.And, of course, after placing my Order, I fretted that I made a mistake. NO WAY would I EVER fit in a Small/Medium! I haven't worn a Small/Medium size in, like, forever! *lol*So, I kept coming back and reading those Reviews to calm my nerves while telling myself over and over, 'You can always send it back', *lol*.Well, the Robe was delivered yesterday and all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!! The Small/Medium size fits me perfectly! I don't have to do a thing to this Robe... I don't have to hem it, or shorten the sleeves. And the fact that this Small/Medium size actually ZIPS UP, (beautifully fitting my 1x hips, bust, waist, and belly), well, I just don't know what to say. I'm AMAZED!It's a shame the SIZING is so 'off' on this Robe, because it's a FANTASTIC piece of clothing. The Fleece is ULTRA-PLUSH, (meaning it's thick), making the Robe so COZY, WARM, and SOFT that I never want to take it off, *lol*.One of the other reasons I wanted this particular Robe, (besides the warmth of the Ultra-Plush Fleece which I so need as I live in the mountains at 7,500-ft), is the fact that it will ZIP-UP to just UNDER MY CHIN keeping my NECK WARM, (just like wearing a turtleneck only not tight at all). But, it's not like it's brushing-up against my chin or getting in the way of my chin. I'd say the neckpiece-portion of the Robe falls about 1-1/2"" below my chin. Again, it's perfect.The LENGTH of the Robe comes just to the top of my feet... no dragging on the floor, so, no need to hem.The SLEEVES come just to the knuckles on my hands... a tidge too long, but, as I'm sitting here typing, the slack is taken up and the sleeve rests very comfortably at my wrists. If I were to do dishes in this Robe, I would have to roll-up the cuff.I WASHED & DRIED this Robe before actually wearing it. I tried it on first, of course, and when I decided it was a great fit, went ahead and washed on WARM and dried on DELICATE. NO SHRINKAGE.I can't say enough GOOD things about this Robe. I just placed an Order for another... two, actually. One for my sister, and another for me to keep for whenever this one wears-out. I NEVER want to be without this Robe... THAT'S how GOOD it is.So, buy it with CONFIDENCE. As long as you take into consideration the 'OFF-SIZING' and order accordingly, you will be pleased as punch with this purchase.p.s. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this Robe to women who actually ARE, and wear, a Small/Medium size... it will just be far too big for you. This Robe, whether by design or accident, is fitted for Larger-sized women.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJE8CHS4NR3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2T1C6C#wasThisHelpful","R2KJE8CHS4NR3V","A2TQD6R721TBOJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TQD6R721TBOJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot express just how perfect these socks are.First, a little background. I wear a size 9M shoe, 1x in clothing, am 5'3"", and weigh 160-lbs. My calf circumference is 13"" at the widest point. I'm also Type II Diabetic who suffers from nerve pain in my feet. Indeed, my feet are extremely sensitive to touch.Now then, these socks are so SOFT, it's just practically unbelievable. I've NEVER felt socks so soft to the touch before. They don't hurt my sensitive feet at all to wear them. Both the fleece inside them, and the material on the outside, is just soft as can be.The FLEECE on the inside provides both softness and WARMTH. My feet have been freezing over these past winter weeks, and these socks have solved that problem... both in my home and running around town. Now, mind you, they're not roasty-toasty like a 70% wool sock is, but they're warm enough to get you from the house to the car to the store (or wherever), and back again. If you're wanting to trudge around in the snow, then, no, these socks were not designed for that. In such a case, I would use them as a 'Liner' sock.They say these socks are 'OVER-THE-KNEE'. Maybe on a thinner person, but not on me. They come just to my knee, (quite comfortably so... no tugging, stretching, pulling to get them there). As it so happens, to my knee is just where I want them. There is a WIDE-BAND at the top of these socks, but in no way is it tight. These socks are stretchy, but stay put without cutting off your circulation.The price is fantastic... $11-bucks for 2-pair.Oh Yeah, I finally found the PERFECT sock for me, and I'm back for more!If all these things meet your criteria then, by all means, give these socks a try. Buy them with the utmost of confidence. I think you'll be very glad you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DB2P4ZG3ATMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB5IQ3C#wasThisHelpful","R3DB2P4ZG3ATMR","A2TQD6R721TBOJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TQD6R721TBOJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this Nail Polish! The BRUSH is wide, so, holds more paint... two strokes and you're done. This Polish is also SATURATED with colour... ONE COAT is all you need. This particular colour, 'Royal Flush', is a very DEEP ROSE PINK. On my monitor, this colour looks like a bright Fuschia, practically neon! It isn't, it's a much darker, much more deep Magenta than a bright Fuschia.As for those complaining about 'chipping'... this Polish lasts me 3 weeks... NO CHIPPING. That's right, 3 WEEKS!For anyone who thinks you can apply Nail Polish without a BASE Coat and a TOP Coat and have no chipping, well, all I can say is 'You don't know the first thing about paint, let alone painting nails'.My nails are very long and natural, (measured from the Cuticle, 3/4"" long). I've been giving myself manicures for 45-years, thus, I think it's safe to say that I know 'Polish' and that I know 'how' to paint nails.1. ALL Polish requires a BASE COAT of something in order for the Polish to adhere properly to the nail. To this end, the BEST is Orly's 'Ridgefiller'. Orly Base Nail Coat, Ridgefiller, 0.6 Ounce. It will give your nails a smooth canvas making the Polish glide on effortlessly, as it's supposed to. If, after the 'Ridgefiller' dries, (about 15-minutes), you feel any roughness, take your 'buffing' file and rub lightly over your nails. They will feel silky-smooth to the touch. Tropical Shine 4-Way Large Nail BufferAs well, the 'Ridgefiller' will keep AIR BUBBLES from ruining your manicure. Why? Because it fills-in the natural 'ridges' in your nails. These 'ridges' trap air. And this air eventually finds its way up thru the Polish as bubbles.2. Apply the Polish. As I said, this particular Polish, and colour, is so saturated with pigment, you only need one coat. It is thicker than other Polishes, so you've got a lot of maneuverability with this Polish. As an aside, it doesn't matter if you get Polish on the skin surrounding your nail, this will be erased at the end of the drying process. So, if the Polish isn't applied 'perfectly', don't worry about it.3. Once the Polish is dry, (I let ALL Polishes dry for an hour), you need to apply a TOP COAT. To this end, the BEST is Brucci 'Acrylic Top Coat', (you can get this at Sally's). This stuff makes your Polish last seemingly forever! As I said, I get 3-weeks out of this Polish all-the-while cooking, cleaning, and doing dishes all day long (without gloves), as well as typing on the computer. Once-a-week, I apply another coat of the Brucci TOP COAT and it keeps my nails looking fantastic. Truly, I have to give myself a manicure with new Polish because my nails have grown so far out from the cuticle, not because the Polish is chipping off.4.

"I bought this steamer just over two years ago, and it's still going strong. Everyone else has written the pluses of this product so I will not reiterate here. All I know is that it's better than a stove-top steamer, and better than microwave steaming. I use this thing, at the least, 4-times a week. Needless to say, I'm a very happy camper. This product has quite exceeded my expectations.I also bought one for my niece who's away at college. She tells me they all use it in the shared kitchen downstairs!

"I am reviewing the Pink Lift / Rose #703, (this is what is printed on the back of the case), of the L'Oreal Paris Visible Lift Color Blush.Now then, when I say 'perfect for me', I mean exactly that. 'Colour' is such a subjective thing, one just has to try, and try, and try so many makeup colours before they find the right shade, tone, blah, blah, blah for them.This pink, with a very hint of 'bright' rose undertone, is lovely for me. This is not a 'mauvy' or 'lavenderish' pink. It is definitely on the brighter-side of pink. Think 'Queen Elizabeth Roses' pink only 'paler'. It's not a 'bubble-gum' pink either... so don't get that idea in your head. Sheesh. Trying to explain colour is nigh impossible!Anyways, I'm old-school. I come from 'rouge' world. For years and years, dare I say 'decades', blush was 'powder'. And I hate that. First of all, you can't get a really proper colour match to your lipstick. Second of all, the texture of powder is, well, in-a-word, 'horribly dry'. UGH UGH UGH.A 'rouge' is always cream-based. And what's so great about this particular blush is that it goes on 'creamy', but dries enough so that it is no longer 'creamy' to the touch. It's 'dry', but doesn't 'feel' or 'look' like 'powder'. Total brilliance as far as I'm concerned.It has a slight 'shimmer' to it. And I don't like shimmer-- I like matte. But, I cover this blush with my loose face powder anyway, so any hint of shimmer goes away. BUT, here's the fantastic thing: the colour stays!... even after applying your finishing powder. More brilliance!Okay... back to the colour. As there are about a million shades of pink out there, finding the right one is both costly, time-consuming, and frustrating. Let it be stated that I have been searching for YEARS for this colour. Make no mistake, like others have said, it's pale. But that's what I like about it. So many blushes are just a waste. You spend more time wiping most of the product off because the colour is so saturated. Now, while you want a saturated foundation to cover your skin, giving you that flawless palette., you DO NOT want your blush to have that same kind of saturation... else you end up looking so garish and, like I said, having to wipe so much away.Which is why I LOVE this product so much, that I turned around and bought 3 more online the very next day, cuz, dontcha know, just when you find something you love, it's discontinued. So, yeah, I'm stocking up big time on this blush.Back to the colour. Because it's creamy and dries powdery, it can be built upon. You WILL get a deeper, darker colour if you put on additional applications. For me, this is dictated by my lipstick. If I wear a pale shade of pink, I use one application of this blush. If I wear a darker shade of pink, I use two applications of blush. But never have I used more than three... and that's only when going out in the evening or to a dimly-lit formal affair.While others have stated that they use their fingers to apply this blush, I never use my fingers for any makeup application. I use a cosmetic sponge for this blush.I'm sure when all is said and done, I will have purchased at least 20 of these Pink Lift/Rose #703 blushes, (not to be confused with the 'Rose Lift' blush). And, yeah, you heard me right, *lol*. I do the same with my lipstick. Another item that is so difficult to find the right shade of. Well, I found mine and it matches so perfectly to this blush... (Maybelline 'Hooked On Pink', but, shhh, don't tell anybody I said so, *lol*). You can purchase it on Amazon as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SF7MDMUYG6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUFS5ZM#wasThisHelpful","R30SF7MDMUYG6C","A2TQD6R721TBOJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TQD6R721TBOJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a professional Astrologer, and long-time student of 'Alchemy'. While Astrology is easy for me, Alchemy has been written of in such an obscure manner that I have had a difficult time understanding the 'bottom-line' of its philosophy.Well, NO MORE! This book, in one fell swoop, explains Alchemy so simply that I am shocked at the obscuration in previously written tomes. However, looking at the time-period of those writings, I can see why... for, what Alchemy actually is, would have been construed by the 'Church' as absolute heresy... punishable by death.Imagine that... instead of 'GOD' fixing what ails you, you can heal yourself using the 'brains' GOD gave you and the knowledge required of attaining true health, (as is explained in this book)... hence, who needs the 'Church'? No wonder they claimed 'Alchemy' as heresy. If people today knew of the information contained in this book, they, (the 'Church'), and the pharmaceutical companies would be out-of-business forthwith. I shudder to contemplate all of the needless suffering over the ages because of the Church's denouncement of Alchemy, and all so they could keep their stranglehold on humanity. Shameful.Anyway, I was so pleased to get not only the 'bottom-line' of Alchemy, but the more esoteric links of Alchemy to Astrology. This, alone, is worth the price of admission in being able to delineate a Chart more deeply... especially in terms of 'health'.The only negative comment I have about the book is the lack of explaining just how to diagnose, using one's Astrological Chart... nor, what dosages of the Cell Salts one should use, or for how long. Alas, being a dowser myself, I am presently using a Pendulum to determine such. Almost all books on Pendulums will have a 'Bio-Chemistry' chart contained therein for such purposes.In the final analysis, I cannot say enough about this book. It wraps up, in a perfect package, the Etymology of words, (with fabulous Bible references--Chapter & Verse); the Astrological linkages for a deeper understanding of the Bible, and the Philosophy of Alchemy in plain English.Buy it... you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSJURR4DW1L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1614274231#wasThisHelpful","R3JSJURR4DW1L0","A2TQD6R721TBOJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TQD6R721TBOJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote the following in response to so-called book critic 'Dana Kennedy's' review of Sondra's book:Dana Kennedy: ""I had a frightening premonition about the future of celebrity autobiographies... Everyone from Carmen Electra to the Olsen twins will be penning detailed and increasingly superfluous Hollywood memoirs. Lacking the rich anecdotes about classic movies, legendary directors, and passionate love affairs that the real stars of old wove into their bios, the tales told by also-rans like Locke are frequently padded with lengthy analyses of forgettable films"".I have no idea who Dana Kennedy is; but, the obvious conclusion I draw from this person's analysis of Locke's book is an unevolved wannabe in the world of 'being noticed'. Those that can, 'do'. Those that can't, 'teach'. Those that can neither do nor teach, 'criticize'... and not very well at that.Dana Kennedy's 'frightening premonition' is based soley on that fact that he/she is impervious to the actual meaning behind these kinds of books. That meaning being breaking the bonds/shredding the veil of 'celebrity'. They cause us to realize that celebrity isn't all it's cracked-up to be. Dana wants to be regaled with 'rich anecdotes, legendary directors, passionate love affairs'... in other words, he/she wants to remain mystified, spellbound, enchanted with celebrity. Well, Dana THAT's what 'fiction' is for... not biographies.Sondra Locke did not settle for 'almost nothing' in her first suit against Clint Eastwood. She walked away with $450,000-cash, a director's deal at Warner Brothers, and Gordon's house. She accepted the low-cash settlement and Gordon's house precisely because of the Warner Brothers' deal so that she could continue her career pursuits of directing. She already had two critically-successful debuts as a director and felt confident that she could both feel satisfied creatively, while also turning a profit for both herself and Warner Brothers.That the Warner Brothers deal was a sham from the start is the crux of her book. I suspect you take her to task here because she dared to expose the 'man behind the curtain', and the machinations thereof, to the rest of us.While reality frightens Dana Kennedy, I, for one, was pleased that Sondra Locke had the courage to not only fight 'the powers that be', but also the courage to write about it. For every successful movie/acting career out there, there are 10,000 starving artists. This book clearly shows the hazards one is very likely to run into when stepping into this arena. How many people-- so nave, so innocent, so taken also by the 'fantasy' of Hollywood such as Dana describes-- have been crushed under the wheels of the morally corrupt and tawdry underbelly that truly runs Hollywood?Personally, I found Sondra Locke's book written from the heart of someone who is honest, decent, and morally intact. That her own naivete caused her downfall is neither here nor there. She fell in love, and that love blinded her to the truth, (of a very sick man, and a very sick industry), much the same as Dana Kennedy seems to want to fall under the same spell when reading bios of celebrities.As for Sondra's and Gordon's 'mystical' experiences, only those who have experienced the same kinds of things can relate. Those who have not, can do nothing but scoff. I, myself, attained Samadhi at the age of 20. With no one to turn to because such things rarely happen, especially in our Western Culture, I was left both ecstatic and devastated. I'm 60-years-old now, and it took me the better part of my life to find out just what 'had' happened to me way back when.And, much like Gordon's and Sondra's journey into the mystic, I, too, experienced frequent signs, omens, and breadcrumbs along the way. For Dana to pooh-pooh these kinds of experiences is to reveal oneself as not only ignorant, but of closed mind and closed heart. More's the pity.As for Clint Eastwood, there is no question this man is one sick, narcissistic sociopath. Any man who wants his woman to call him 'daddy' has the mark of a man whose psychology takes the shape of 'paternalistic power' expressed lustfully. In other words, he doesn't sexualize children, he 'childrenizes' his sexual partners. His sexuality does not express love, it expresses lust.. a predatory lust for power over the targeted prey.In the end, Sondra fell in love with his soul, but found that his present incarnated personality was far from the ideal. Still, she needed this experience... and so did he. She needed it to grow-up, to become an adult. He needed it to become aware of his abuse of power and transcend it. Which he still hasn't done to date. Again, more's the pity. Let's hope he does better the next time around.All-in-all, this is a very good book. It's well-written, informative, and an enjoyable read. It's well-worth one's time engaging it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JHM0EZAMJSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=068815462X#wasThisHelpful","R30JHM0EZAMJSX","A2TQD6R721TBOJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TQD6R721TBOJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He caters small parties at present and has had rave reviews of his food and many referrals. He especially wanted to know the basics of cost-analysis and pricing-out his food per person.

"I just love this colour. It's what I would call a medium-pink... not so deep as 'Cherries in the Snow' by Revlon that appears practically 'red', and not so pale or pastel to be a cotton-candy pink either. No, it's got just enough saturation to give a rich, ritzy pink colour that says, 'zowie'! There's no mistaking 'Bachelorette Bash' for anything than a totally pink statement. In fact, I'd actually call it a 'power pink'... it's much more a 'womanly' colour than a 'girly' colour.The polish itself goes on smoothly... and I was surprised by this. I'm so used to Orly polishes, that I wasn't sure how another brand would do. Well, it applies just as well as the Orly. It's not thick and bulky, but thin and wet with a wonderful spread... if that makes any sense to you.

I just cant describe how much I loved this book! It had all the things I lovesecond chance romance and Christmas! A Christmas themed amusement park?!? I couldnt wait to get there.This book brings forth a tsunami of emotions! I laughed, I cried, I even laughed and cried at the same time! I LOVE books that make me feel the characterstheir pain, their joy, their sadnessand Maggie McGinnis possesses this ability. She rips your heart right out of your chest, shatters it, and then puts it back together again! An emotional roller coaster ride, if Ive ever been on one.Returning to Echo Lake, Vermont with Josie was like coming home.  You feel like you are a part of the family, and have just been away for a while. It feels good to be back, and reacquainted  a chance to catch up.

Josie is a therapist, residing in Boston. When her father has a stroke, she returns home. There is more for her to face than her fathers illness.

"Once again, Scott Hildreth has captivated me! I loved Stevie when I met her in the first book in this series. Getting to know her better and meeting Wilson was an experience I won't forget. Talk about opposites attracting! I know this to be true because my husband and I are total opposites - but not to this extreme! Stevie has got to be the most colorful character I've met in a book thus far - literally and spiritually. She is a beautiful soul with a tough exterior. Wilson should be cloned so we can all have one!I am now of the opinion that if Scott Hildreth writes a phone book, I will be compelled to read it! I highly recommend for those with strong intestinal fortitude, a love of tattoos, smart-mouthed heroines and erotic escapades. I'll never eat another donut without thinking of Stevie and Wilson!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQXU6AJKG2P14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178VNZ2I#wasThisHelpful","RQXU6AJKG2P14","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that this is a beautifully written book. It is a stunning story. Grab your tissues. You will need them.The emotional intensity and true-to-life characters that jump off the page made this book completely satisfying. Emily March is simply a great storyteller. HEARTSONG COTTAGE is well-written, nicely paced with appealing characters that you want to get to know better. It was intense and full of emotional torment. The array of unfortunate circumstances and secrets make for a riveting read. Fate was not kind to Daniel Garrett and Shannon OToole. Now, there seems to be a light in the endless tunnel that their lives have become. Could there possibly be a second chance to love for these two? I became totally immersed in their story. As we know, anything is possible in Eternity SpringsThe authors descriptions of the small town setting, and the people who reside there and their surroundings is unsurpassed. You feel like you are there. Her writing style is exquisite. You feel what is happening, rather than having it told to you. This book is an exploration of so many things  grief, family dynamics, romance, lies, deception, betrayal and mysterya gripping read - and oftentimes heart-wrenching. Emily March created well-developed characters and an emotion-packed story. The dialogue is easy to read and flows well. I love that the characters were human. They talked, felt and reacted like real people that you know.Set aside some reading time before you pick up this book because it really is hard to put down. You will find yourself thinking about it even when you are not reading it. It kept me riveted to the pages after the introductory chapters. It grabbed me and didnt let go. Emily March ably draws us along to search for the answers right along with the characters. Its a beautiful soul-grabbing storyI highly recommend!*An advance reading copy was generously provided by the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7GA9MCCRXTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHJM7RU#wasThisHelpful","R3O7GA9MCCRXTT","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A southern version of Romeo and Juliette with a happy ending! What could be better than that? As a Shakespeare fan, I loved all the references to the bard's work in the content of the story. Romy Satterfield and Julian McElroy's families do not get along. They have a secret romance and inevitably a secret marriage. Sound familiar?If you read the previous book, The Happy Hour Choir, you met the townsfolk of Ellery, and have already grown to love them. Bittersweet Creek gives you a chance to revisit them and their quirky community. That's a huge bonus.  The creek that divides the property of the Satterfield and McElroy properties is aptly named. The result is the bittersweet romance between their children, Romy and Julian.There are many twists and turns in this story. It is fraught with pain and mystery. I very much enjoyed the journey - and the destination. I think you will, too. I highly recommend Bittersweet Creek. Get to know these people. You won't regret it.*An advance reader copy was generously provided by the publisher and NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDLPQTR3D5P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7O8X0#wasThisHelpful","R2VDLPQTR3D5P2","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I made a decision after reading this book. If Sarah Castille writes it, I'm reading it. She's a 1-click author for me! If it's about the Sinner's Tribe Motorcycle Club, SO much the better! I love these guys, and I love this series. Each book is as good as the last one - if not better. There are no cliff hangers. Each book is about a different couple, while still keeping up with past characters - my favorite kind of series!Zane ""Tracker"" Colton and Evie were a pair to be reckoned with. Friends since they were nine years old, they developed romantic feelings for each other when Evie was just finishing high school. You never forget your first love. This was true for both of them. Due to circumstances beyond their control, they were separated and didn't see each other for years. Evie waited for Zane to return for her. She felt he had abandoned her, so after three years she moved on with her life. Hind-sight is 20/20.In the two previous books, Zane made reference several times to his reason for avoiding relationships, stating ""women will rip your heart out, rub it in salt, and then stomp on it.' His brothers all knew that someone had done a number on Zane. Turns out he was referring to Evie. Now, here she is - and guess what? She's dating the president of their most hated rivals. This is a total mess!Sarah Castille has the ability to grab you by the throat at the beginning of her books, and hold on until the end. The characters are real. I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading this story. The banter between the characters is downright funny. You fall in love with each and every one of them - even though they are all so different.I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Zane and Evie and following their journey back to finding each other. I know you will, too! I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A461TJM2OPHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3B0TWY#wasThisHelpful","R1A461TJM2OPHA","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It made some of his actions more understandable and really revealed how confused he was about the relationship with Anastasia and his feelings for her. I hope E.L.

"I LOVED THIS BOOK! I hate cliffhangers, and yes, this book has one - but knowing that the rest of the story is following shortly, is a relief. Now I can take a short break to digest the story and get ready for the conclusion. As this is not a serial or short story, you do not feel manipulated or cheated. It feels like the author has taken the time to fully develop and flesh-out the characters - even though they remain a mystery to the end - you are getting to know them slowly, as they are getting to know each other. Each character has a story to tell and it keeps you riveted.Annie and Dylan are an unlikely pairing, but as their story develops, you see a lot of parallels. Their chance encounter has lasting consequences - both good and bad - for both of them. The fact that they got to know each other and developed feelings before ever physically meeting each other was fascinating. Dylan's loneliness reverberated throughout the book, and made my heart hurt. This is not your typical romance.(Yes, there are plenty of hot, sexy, steamy moments). You feel like you are living in the story. M. O'Keefe is a masterful, talented author!I highly recommend as I impatiently wait for the rest of the story (coming next month)!*An advance reading copy was generously provided by the publisher and NetGalley for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NOJGY0T33YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WM#wasThisHelpful","R25NOJGY0T33YG","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for the perfect purse/travel bag, and this was it! Be aware that this is a BIG bag! It's not going to slide under the seat in front of you on an airplane. It definitely has to go in overhead storage. It is the perfect size for taking essentials on short trips. You can put the larger tablets inside with room to spare. It is attractive and has lots of little slots to stow smaller objects that you don't want to lose in your bag. It seems to be very durable.

"Read this book description (if you can take your eyes off the cover). It says it all! I LOVE military romance stories! This one definitely does NOT disappoint, and has a fresh and new plot-line that keeps you turning the pages just to find out what will happen next. Neve James is a dancer. She has been a pen pal to Rory McRoy for months. When he is on leave from his deployment in Afghanistan, she decides to surprise him when he arrives in Boston  but she is the one who gets a surprise. It seems that Rorys fianc is there as well! Oops! I guess he forgot to mention that during all those heartfelt letters...Rory has to return to Afghanistan before he has a chance to fix things between them. He is determined to set things straight with Neve, so after four agonizing months, hes going to New York to prove to her that he is not the man she thinks he is. He does not give up easily, and this is a war he is determined to win.ALL I NEED IS YOU by Wendy S. Marcus is romance at its finest. I dont have the words to describe how much I LOVED this story. I did not want it to end. Rory McRoy and Neve James have an explosive relationship that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. This author is unsurpassed at writing page after page of hot, sweet, humorous banter between her characters that keep you glued to the pages. Neve definitely kept Rory on his toes. I couldnt get this story off my mind after I finished it. Rory and Neves intense connection and fiercely passionate romance will keep you hooked.

"This is the 6th book in the outstanding Caribou Crossing series by Susan Fox and it is simply stunning! As the book description proclaims, this is a spell-binding tale of romance and healing.

The characters are intense, the situations and topics even more so.This heartbreakingly beautiful story is one to keep and read again.  LOVE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU is touching, and poignant. To say I loved this book is an understatement. From the first page to the last, Susan Fox had me spellbound and lost in her beautiful, heartfelt, writing. I didnt want it to end. I didnt want to leave Caribou Crossing or these characters..If you want a beautifully told romantic story about loving, losing, healing and in the process, finding yourself, then be sure to read this story.

"What do you get when you put a beautiful female firefighter and a mayor that is up for re-election together? Fireworks! PLAYING WITH FIRE is a sexy and fun, drama-filled romance. Alexandra Dempsey and Eli Cooper are electric. Whenever they are together, there are sparks flying. They are drawn together like magnets, but falling in love could be deadly for them both. He is her boss, after all. Just because she saved him, doesnt mean she should save his campaign, but that seems to be whats happening. This is a hot sexy romance with plenty of chemistry and intensity. You wont want to put it down until it comes to its satisfying conclusion.This is the second book in the Hot in Chicago series by Kate Meader. The author grabs you from the first page and pulls you in. The writing style is crisp and descriptive. You are right there with the characters. The secondary characters add much to the enjoyment of the story. They captivate and titillate. Its not all romance, though. There is family drama, fun and sexy banter, and rules to be broken.You will love, love, love the secondary characters! Of course they are setting us up for their future stories in the series, but that is fine. They add so much to the story that you cant imagine life without them. You will be hooked and impatiently waiting to spend more time with them. They have no respect for personal space, which makes them more endearing than they already are. They are a team. They are a family.This series has gripped me from the beginning. Eli Cooper is the match that strikes the fire in Alexs soul (and body). The chemistry between the two of them is scorching hot. I kept expecting my Kindle to start smoking. Be sure you are well rested before you start this book. It WILL keep you up into the wee hours. I look forward to reading more of this series in the future.*An advance reading copy was generously provided by the publisher and NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VHMFSR90S0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI7Q4#wasThisHelpful","R11VHMFSR90S0R","A1LT13C3BKQ9CU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LT13C3BKQ9CU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the K2 Team novels and let me just say, I LOVE THIS SERIES! This book is about Jamie ""Saint"" Turner and Sugar Darling. He is a serious soul. He doesnt curse, drink or smoke. He seldom, if ever, smiles. He has demons from the past that are keeping him from living a normal life. He functions, but is not really living. That is how it should be. That is what he deserves.Sugar Darling is filling in as receptionist at K2 Security for two weeks. She is the polar opposite of everything that Jamie looks for in a woman. He has recently started looking for someone to settle down with. Someone that could be the mother to his children. Someone, prim, proper anddare I say, boring? So why is he inexplicably drawn to this woman who is totally inappropriate and opposite of everything he wants. Like a moth to a flame, even though he knows she is dangerous to him, he cant seem to stay away from her.There is much more to Sugar Darling than meets the eye. Something is stirring under the surface. There is more there than what she projects with her ditzy dumb blond persona. What is she hiding? Why does Jamie feel this innate and overwhelming desire to protect her?There are interesting plot twists and drama in this book. I found it impossible to put down. I just had to keep turning those pagesso I pretty much lost a day while I was immersed in this story. There is a LOT of plot development in this book  in the form of drama, mystery, intrigue, suspense, disquiet and upheaval. After all theyve been through, Jamie and Sugar certainly deserve a happily ever after. They still have demons to fight, but their love holds strong.An intriguing exploration of love and redemption, FALLING FOR HER is captivating and passionate.

"To say that I loved this book is an understatement! Scott Hildreth is my new favorite author! I am reading everything he has written. BLURRED LINES is not a typical romance. Blake West is a complicated mess! That is all I'll say about that. With that said, you will fall in love with him. He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. Riley Campbell has no idea what she's getting into when she decides to get her first tattoo. Stepping through the doors of the Blurred Lines tattoo shop was almost like stepping through the looking glass. WOW! What an emotional roller coaster ride it was!All I can say is, READ THIS BOOK!

"This book is a suspenseful romantic drama with a cliff-hanger ending. The story of Madrigal and Trenton draws you in from the beginning. There is definitely a May to December element going on, but I finally managed to get past that and was immersed in the storyline.

"Kate Regnery has very quickly become one of my favorite authors. I have loved every book she has written, and CRAZY ABOUT CAMERON is no exception. I love her ability to build a relationship between the characters that is believably paced and always realistic. You can literally feel the chemistry between Cam and Meggie as they are pulled deeper and deeper into a passionate romantic relationship..Every book in the Blueberry Lane series is a delicious and delightful read that you don't want to leave when it ends. There is definitely enough ""naughty"" to make it nice. Cameron Winslow is a hot and sexy panty-melting alpha-male with a sweet side. There is nothing better than a macho man that can be gentle. Ms. Regnery has perfected the genre! Each book seems to be better than the last. How is that even possible?CRAZY ABOUT CAMERON was a winner in my playbook.

She is the daughter of a senator, and in the political spotlight. She knows that she will never again experience the passion that she had with Sebastian and Shane. When they left, she closed her heart. She never wanted to have and lose that kind of intensity again. She couldnt survive it.There is mystery and intrigue to this story. There are things that you do not discover right awayand sometimes not at all. Alyssa first met the cousins at a party, and there was definitely chemistry between them. Five months later, while vacationing in Spain, she encounters them again and three months of sensual pleasure between the three, ensue. Yes, this is a M/M/F romance. While this is not my normal genre, Lora Leigh made it seem like a natural progression of the story.I liked the suspense and mystery of the plot-line. There was a story that kept you riveted to the pages. Of course there was plenty of hot, steamy romance to satisfy even the most voracious romance reader. Sebastian and Shane were the very epitome of sexy hotness. How lucky can a girl be to have not one, but two alpha men ready to grant your every erotic fantasy? Alyssa was a sassy heroine, and was able to hold her own with the two of them. Too bad that all good things must come to an endor do they?When the cousins come back into her life, they are there to protect her  but the passion between them re-ignites and burns hotter than ever. Whoa! Hang onto your seat! Lora Leigh knows how to grab you with her story, and doesnt let you go! Be sure to set aside plenty of time to finish this book when you start it. Its not one that you can put down and come back to. She knows her way around erotica and M/M/F relationships. She holds your interest from the first chapter until the last.

"4.5 StarsHe's her weapon of choice.What could be better than a new motorcycle club series? I was very excited to get my hands on RIDING DIRTY by Jill Sorenson, the first book in the Dirty Eleven Motorcycle Club Series. It did NOT disappoint!Psychologist Mia Richards wants revenge. Her new client, tattooed Cole ""Shank"" Shepherd, provides the perfect means. She just has to manipulate the felon-turned-informant into eliminating her husband's killersmembers of Cole's rival motorcycle club. The first step, seducing Cole, is simple. As for walking away before she falls hardit's already too lateI loved Cole Shepherd. I wonder what he might have been if hed been given a chance to reach his potential. His story really makes you stop and think about thatand what a vicious cycle our penal system creates. Prison really is a level of society all its own. Scary when you are confronted with what really goes on. Sadly, its still scary when you get out.I really liked Mia Richards. She was a strong woman on the outside, but embraced her inner vixen better than any heroine Ive read in a long time. I liked that she acknowledged her weaknesses and owned them (even her propensity for peeing her pants under pressure). Ms. Sorenson has written a sizzling romance that is impossible to put down. The chemistry between Cole and Mia is undeniable. It is definitely a hot and deliciously steamy read.This is a raw, gritty, story that keeps you guessing about the outcome. Jill Sorenson does not sugarcoat the life in the Dirty Eleven Motorcycle Club. Her characters are real  and flawed  even the good guys are represented as real people who have their own problems, inner turmoil and demons. I loved that. The secondary characters for the most part were people that you love to hate. I was hooked from the very beginning and was held captive until the end.

I also no longer have bleeding cuticles, which is a real score for me! I have even been putting it on my feet. Such a luxurious treat!

"Tracker's End is the third book in the Wind Dragons MC series by Chantal Fernando.  I was SO looking forward to reading Trackers story. He seemed to be ""the rogue"" of the MC in the two previous books and was my favorite character in the club. He did not disappoint - well maybe a little with his actions and behavior in one particular situation... Tracker has been teasing us in the first two books in the series  and now we finally get to know more about him.Tracker and Lana are a very unlikely combination. You certainly don't expect Anna's friend Lana to be the type of girl you'd see hanging out in a biker club - much less being with one of its biggest players. Hmm...there is a side of Lana that surprises everyone - and in a very erotic way. Who would have guessed?Chantal Fernando can take you inside the biker world and make you feel like you are a part of it - getting to know the characters, understanding their love and devotion to each other, and never wanting to leave them. She does not sugar-coat - there are raw and intense emotions and page-turning suspenseful situations. There are instances when the characters behave badly and you want to shake them - but not too many! The sex scenes are smokin' hot and let's just say that Tracker has a VERY active libido! This book is gritty, raw, and incredibly sexy.I strongly recommend this series to those that crave their bad-boy bikers and the women who love them. You will NOT be disappointed.

As her character develops, you come to understand her a little better  and why she acts the way she does.Let me just say that I LOVE Henrik! There were so many contradictions with that man. He was complex with a side of vulnerable. It turns out thats the perfect combination.

"I LOVE anything to do with New Orleans, and anything about motorcycle clubs - so this was definitely the book for me. Let me just say that his book is HOT, HOT, HOT  as in VERY erotic! I think my Kindle is still smoking. Ajax is my new favorite MC bad-boy. This is the first book in a new series, so there is more goodness coming our way!Megan Crane has the most unique writing style. Its like reading erotic, sexy, raw, gritty, dirty poetry. You just have to read this book to understand what Im trying to express  but she has an amazing way of character expression. They are real, they are raw, and they are laugh out loud funny at times.Ajax and Sophie were a fun couple to get to know and getting to hang out in New Orleans was icing on the cake. The development of their relationship was hard for both of them. Neither of them wanted it, but there was no stopping it  definitely a runaway train! There is not a lot of dialog between the characters. Their relationship is physical. I guess bad-boy alpha bikers dont do a lot of talking. That would make them house cats. There is quite a bit of inner dialog going on with them. There were secondary characters in the story, but they were not the focus. There was also an underlying mystery about the club and the death its president that were not solved in this book  merely mentioned.

"4.5 StarsFantasy is not my usual genre, but something about the description of this book, just pulled at me. I had to read it. I am so glad that I did. It is a magical story  a gothic romance with elements of magic sprinkled throughout, make LAMP BLACK, WOLF GREY an enchanting reading experience.Artist Laura Matthews and her husband Dan have given up city life to move to an ancient longhouse, high in the Welsh Mountains. It is a place of tales and legends, myths and fables. She is hoping that the beauty surrounding her will inspire her to produce her best art yet, and will give them the chance to have they baby they have both longed for.There are so many magical characters in this tale. You just cant wait to peek around a tree to discover who you might meet next. The mystery and intrigue of all of these elements keep the pages turning at a rapid pace. There are two stories that converge to make this book have a fairytale quality that I loved.  It goes past to present as the tale progresses. In the past, Megan loves Merlin and in the present, Laura loves Dan. If I say more, it will sound confusing, so I will stop, and encourage you to read the book. It is magical and mystical.Paula Brackston delights with her unique writing style. The story is poignant and heartwarming  it fills the senses...courtesy of Ms. Brackstons amazing narrative. Reading her words is an experience all its own. The characters are complicated. You relate to them on some levels. You feel their pain, their joy, their sorrowI highly recommend LAMP BLACK, WOLF GREY. Its charming, enchanting - and not to be missed!*I received an eBook copy from the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.

"First, let me say, I LOVE this series! I cannot wait for each book! I have been looking forward to Bretts story. I was kind of feeling bad for him in Plain Jayne and was hoping for a book about him. Who can resist a man in uniform? Apparently Ellie Palmer can. Him pulling her over doesnt make her feel the love, eitherand this isnt the first time! Now she has to take a safe-driving course with him. Let the fun begin and the sparks fly!This was a cute book, but also had an interesting plot line that moved at a good pace and kept you turning the pages. Of course theres plenty of angst in the story of Brett and Ellie. I kept wanting to flip to the back to find out what happens! I didnt  but I wanted to! Ellie was a fun character in the previous books  very feisty and opinionated. Shes really a perfect match for Brett. I love it when opposites get together! Ellie finds out that there is more to Brett than you might thinkI mean besides his rock hard body and commanding presence. Whew!This was a fun read! It was also extremely entertaining with an interesting plot that moved at a fast pace. Throw in some sexy romance and you have a book that cant be missed.

"4.5 StarsCammie Laroux has returned to her home in Alabama to help out after her mother has back surgery. Since she is between jobs and because she has wicked chef and organizational skills, she is the perfect candidate to help get the family catering and event venue business, Evangeline House, back to its former glory. She does not know that on this mission of mercy she will be slapped in the face with her devastating past.Grey Harrison broke Cammies heart ten years ago, and she has just recently put her life back together, gotten engaged and put the past in her review mirror. On her first day home, she is face to face with Grey. He has been hired by her mother to renovate the declining family home. Will she be able to hold it all together and face the past that she has spent ten years running from? The result of his betrayal with her best friend is standing right in front of her in the form of his daughter, Samantha. How is she supposed to deal with this? Why should she have to?I am a sucker for second chance romance. I love the angst that goes with past misunderstandings and righting the wrongs from bygone days  especially when the protagonists are older and wiser. That is the case with AGAIN, ALABAMA  but the betrayal by Grey was hard for me to accept at the beginning of the book. I HATE cheating  for whatever perceived excuse, so I spent the first half of the book not feeling the love for Grey. Cammie has enough going on in her life right now. She should not have to have to deal with this. She is engaged to Jason and is moving on with her lifeor is she?The story of Grey Harrison and Cammie Laroux is heart wrenching and poignant. After finishing this book days ago, Im still thinking about the story. I loved the opportunity to meet Cammies family. The secondary characters are so much fun. They make the reader feel like you are there and a part of the family.Cammie and Grey both have very real issues that make it hard for them to pursue a relationship. The chemistry between them is strong, but the obstacles seem to be stronger. Cammie is a very engaging heroine. I also loved her siblings. They were so loving and protective. I hope they get their own stories someday.Susan Sands writing style is powerful. She pulls you into the story, and doesnt let go until the last wordactually, not even then. You will still be feeling it days after the story ends. AGAIN, ALABAMA is a heartwarming story of family and a second chance at love. It was a sweet narrative of love and loss and loving again.

"Kristen Ashley has been one of my top five authors for a long time, and that status never changes. With that said, I have to say that she surprised me with this book. DEACON definitely takes things a step further into erotic, no-holds-barred sexual exploration between the characters. Of course she does it in her ""KA way"" and it works! Oh, Deacon! I think he is by far the most broken man I've come across in quite some time.Cassidy Swallow has got to be my favorite heroine - bar none! I usually find the heroine to be the weakest link in most stories, but that was not the case in this book. She was strong, she was funny, and most important to Deacon, loyal and forgiving. Their relationship was l-o-o-o-o-ng in developing, but when it did - my Kindle started smoking! WOW! That's all I can say about that!Nobody writes an ALPHA macho male better than Kristen Ashley! Don't miss this one - but remember, it's not for the weak at heart.

"Im working through the guilt. Guilt that Gina died and I didnt. Guilt she didnt have her seat belt on and I did. Guilt I didnt take a different route home. Guilt I didnt get the chance to tell her one more time that I loved her before she diedSawyer Bennett introduces a deeply emotional contemporary romance with ZACK, the third book in the Carolina Cold Fury Hockey series. Punctuated by heart-wrenching dialogue and fascinating glimpses into the tough world of hockey, this romance also delivers true heart and emotion, and a story that will stay with the reader long after the final page is turned.Kate Francis is so easy to relate to. College girl, working on her masters degree, struggling financially, the job as nanny to Zack Granthams son, Ben, is a solution to her own situation, as well as providing the support that Ben and Zack need to carry on. The secondary characters were fun to get to revisit  especially Zacks fellow team members and friends. They were loyal and supportive during a difficult time in Zacks life.Let me just say that I LOVE ZACK! There were so many contradictions with that man. He was complex with a side of vulnerable. It turns out thats the perfect combination. Sawyer Bennett has a talent for writing real characters that you enjoy getting to know, and you definitely have a difficult time leaving. This book is no exception. I look forward to reading the next book in the series. I just cant seem to get enough of the Cold Fury hockey team, and the ones they love.

This is the third book in the series, and author Zoe York does not disappoint in delivering everything you could possibly want in a great romance.Ryan Howard is just trying to hang on after losing his wife.

What Ryan doesnt know is that Holly Cresinski  is really Hope Creswell  star of the movie. Let the deception beginwhen Ryan finds out who she really is, what will his reaction be?There are twists and turns, angst and intense and heart-wrenching moments that keep you riveted. Those who have dealt with death and grief will identify with Ryan and how he handles his emotions. I loved the interaction between Ryan and his kids. He is such a good dad in the worst of circumstances.This book grabbed my heart from the beginning and refused to let go. I fell in love with Ryan and Holly. They are real. Zoe York has the ability to make her characters live and breathe. You want to know them. They were both broken, but found a way to heal each other and rid themselves of guilt. They risked hurt to find true love and overcome their fears. The sexual tension crackles off the page. The love that unfolds is tender and beautiful  a romance that goes straight to your heart. Im still smiling.It is a stunning contemporary romance. It will break your heartbut in a very good way. If you want a beautifully told romantic story about loving, losing, healing and in the process, finding yourself, then be sure to read this story. I guarantee you wont be disappointed.

"I admit that I had a little self-preservation in mind when I decided to try this product. My husband has always had a beard, so I'm accustomed to whisker burn - but lately his beard seemed rougher than normal. Since there's significantly more grey in his beard these days, I attribute it to that. I thought he would be the perfect candidate to try Mr. Rugged Bold Beard Lotion Conditioner. I LOVE that name by the way! No reason for him not to feel like a ""macho man"" while he conditions his beard!In all seriousness, this is a great product. It does exactly what it says it does. My husband's beard is significantly softer and just looks better. He says it feels better and is less ""itchy"" - which I think is caused by the dry skin underneath. I highly recommend this product!

"4.5 StarsSarah Castille introduces a deeply emotional, raw and gritty motorcycle club experience with BEYOND THE CUT. Punctuated by blistering-hot sex scenes and fascinating glimpses into the tough world of motorcycle club life, this romance also delivers true heart and emotion, and a story that will stay with the reader long after the final page is turned.Let me just say that I LOVE Cade ""Ryder"" O'Connor! There were so many contradictions with that man. He was all HOT alpha male with a side of vulnerable. It turns out thats the perfect combination. Cade is a traveling man, never one to settle down with one woman for more time than absolutely necessary. But Cade has faced his own demons, and he's learned a lot about himself, and about the life he knows he's meant to live. He has commitment issues and is very clear and honest about it to his women. In other words he doesn't lead them on.Cade is a study in accepting people for who they are. Although I may not have agreed with the way he decided to live his life and his approach to relationships, when you find out his story you can completely understand why he is the way he is and that if Dawn Delgado had handled him in any other way things would not have been able to work between them. I just love a tough, brooding sexy as sin, heart-melting alpha male like Cade. Dawn is a strong heroine  which makes the sparks fly!The secondary characters were fun to get to know  especially Cades friends in the Sinners Tribe Motorcycle Club. Who doesnt like to hang out with a bunch of outlaw alpha bad boys? Sarah Castille is a very talented author. Her characters are real  you feel them. You are in the story all the way, from beginning to end.  It was a raw, steamy, sexy, haunting and a powerful romantic roller coaster ride. I LOVED this riveting story. This was one hot book packed with action, suspense and passion that burns through each chapter between these two. Sarah Castille definitely has an automatic reader with this reviewer. I like her style!  I consider this one a must read. You wont be sorry, and you wont forget it.

"The ESK Collection Set of 6 Bamboo Kitchen Tools consist of three types of spoons and 3 spatulas.  I like this set because I can use them on my nonstick cookware.  Prior to getting these, I used plastic or silicone and wondered if any pvcs were leaking into our food.  The wood is elegant and looks good on my counter where I keep them in a utensil caddy for easy access.  Another reason why I prefer the wooden utensils is that we have well water which seems to discolor any metallic pieces.  As far as this particular set goes, I did feels some rough spots as indicated by another reviewer but can easily be sanded or some steel wool should take care of it.  The known durability of bamboo assures me that these will last a long time.  This is a great price for a 6 piece set.I received the kitchen tools for testing, evaluation and unbiased review.

"In todays world, we are dealing with a new kind of thieves; electronic pickpockets!  They can steal your identity as well as credit cards and bank accounts.  This type of thievery is the worst kind and can ruin you personally and financially.  There are several ways to protect ourselves and the RFID blocking money belt and neck stash wallet from Dromedar, provides an affordable functional way to do that.I defy any pickpocket to get my valuables while wearing the hidden money belt or neck stash wallet. The money belt and wallet are designed to wear under your clothing to conceal your belongings. It is made of thin but durable parachute material and has a soft mesh backing which would go against your skin. It is very comfortable with an adjustable elastic belt and easy closure. Of course you can also wear it outside your clothing as a fanny pack but then you would be defeating its true purpose.The zippered compartments can keep your money and checks separate from you documents such as ID and passport in addition to a couple of smaller pockets, with RFID blocking technology, for credit cards. When I travel, there are certain things that I dont want to leave in my room, like cash and passport. I still keep a purse with me when sightseeing but it only has a small amount of cash or what I know I need for the excursion because lets face it, you wouldnt want to raise your shirt every time you want to get at your money.I received the money belt and neck wallet at a discount from Dromedar for testing, evaluation and unbiased review.

"The polarized sporty sunglasses, with 5 interchangeable lenses from Ponosoon is the most versatile, uniquely cool pair of sunglasses that I have ever seen or had.  The uni-lenses come in a variety of rainbow colors and also includes a clear one.  Thats right, a single lens for two eyes!  They remind me of ski glasses except they are much more stylish.  They are great for cycling, they keep the sun and glare out of your eyes, protect your eyes from wind and debris as well as giving you a little swag.I have had several pairs of sunglasses from this company and have not been disappointed by any of them.  I think they out did themselves with this particular design.  These are my favorite.  They come in a very nice hard case with zipper closure and belt hook.  Inside the foam lined case is the glasses and the extra lenses, along with a cleaning cloth and soft drawstring pouch for easy transport.  The quality of the sunglasses is quite evident in the detail and accessories.  Another nice feature is that they can be comfortably worn by both male and female.  There are several colors available for the frames.  I have the white with red accent.  They go great with almost everything.  They are curved to block peripheral sunlight and are quite comfortable, hugging the contour of my face.  I had thought about giving these as a Christmas gift but I dont think I can part with them.I was given the glasses by Ponosoon for the purpose of testing, evaluation and review.  Based on my personal experience, I would definitely recommend them.  I have not worn them for sports yet, however I did wear them to a soccer game and was the envy of some of the moms.  I have also worn them in the car when driver and they do a great job blocking out that blinding sun glare when you are driving into a sunset. I definitely recommend them.

"The small wireless FM transmitter from Kollea works remarkably well.  I can tune into my favorite Amazon Music album and play it through my car stereo.  It is like having a free subscription to Sirius radio.  This is a great little device because you not only can play music through your car radio but through any radio.  Back in my party days, we would bring our music to a party or friends house in the form of a cassette tape.  Now, your music is all accessible from your smart phone and this little gadget helps you to broadcast it.The sound, is crystal clear, however it did take some patience and trial to get the right frequency but now that I have it, I am quite pleased with the results.  As an added bonus, I can talk on the phone thorough my cars speaker.  I long drives, it kind of makes me feel like I am not alone.  Even when I am not talking, I am listening to all my favorite songs.  As far as the device, I dont have anything to compare it to since I have never had anything like this before but I can tell you that it does everything that it says, is easy to use, small enough to carry in your pocket.I was given the Kollea wireless transmitter for testing, evaluation and unbiased review.

"The Eco Friendly stretch lids from Kitchen Genius are just that.genius!  The 6 silicone covers can stretch to fit a variety of sizes.  These are very convenient to use instead of plastic wrap which also saves money since they are washable and reusable.  I also like the fact that I dont have to transfer my leftovers into plastic containers.  I can never find the right lid for the right container and when I open my cupboard where I store the containers, they tumble out in disarray.  These covers on the other hand can be used right over the serving bowl or dish and creates a good tight seal.  They are soft and collapsible so they take up very little space.  These silicone food and bowl covers are clear so you can see what is inside without removing the cover.  Included with the set are two pretty blue, bonus suction lids which actually are my favorite!  They can be used over a drink in the fridge or on a mug.  They are great when heating soup in the microwave to prevent spatter.  The lids are FDA approved and can be used in the freezer and are dishwasher safe.I received a discount on these lids so that I can test, evaluate and give an unbiased review.  Based on my personal experience with them, I would recommend them.  Granted, they are not for everyone because there is some wrestling and getting used to them as one other reviewer put it, but once you get a feel for which lids fit on what containers, then you have it made.  I like them!  I think that they are a marvelous addition to my kitchen toolbox.

"There are three potent active ingredients in this all natural remedy.  Fish Oil which is known for joint lubrication as well as heart health, cats claw root which is popular for an array of illnesses.  It is an anti-inflammatory which help with arthritis.  It is also good for the digestive system and has anti-cancer properties.  I actually had not heard of it before getting these joint supplements for my dog.  I researched it before administering it to her and was surprised at all the ailments that cats claw root is said to alleviate.  The third active ingredient is Willow bark, sometimes called natures aspirin.  It is used to treat pain, inflammation, and musculoskeletal conditions.  So there you have it, three all natural ingredients combined to provide pain relief and repair of sore arthritic joints.I had been giving my 15 year old Labrador retriever, Glucosamine tablets as well as a popular prescription canine anti-inflammatory tablet for her arthritis and pain.  It helps with one ailment and causes other issues like upset stomach and diarrhea.  I was so happy to come across this natural alternative.  I know that she does not have much longer in this world and I want to make her final days as comfortable as possible and possibly extend her time with us.I received the Joint and Hip supplements from Primal in return for testing, evaluation and review.  Based on my experience so far, it has been very positive.  My dog likes them, which is a huge plus.  I would not use them if I had to shove them down her throat.  The ingredients are all natural and from my research, are also effective.  I am enthusiastic and optimistic about this new course of treatment.  After all, nothing is too good for our Princess!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93E8A57GEM8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VLMQM8#wasThisHelpful","R93E8A57GEM8Q","A348W50UDP19EE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348W50UDP19EE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Organic Retinol Body Lotion from True is a nice thick cream that is non greasy and fully absorbs into the skin.  Retinol is an anti-aging ingredient which helps to preserve your skin cells.  I have only been using this for a few weeks and havent noticed younger looking skin, but it is a good moisturizer.  I use it on my hands, arms, elbows and also on my legs when I get out of the shower.  Because of the rich thick texture, a little seems to go a long way.  The bottle is small for body lotion.  If I were to use it generously all over my body, it would be gone in no time and at this price, I use it primarily on my problem areas and in small amounts.  It has a clean fresh light scent.  I also like having the cream in a pump dispenser so you do not contaminate the supply as compared to a jar into which you are dipping your fingers.  Also on the plus side is the fact that it is organic, cruelty free and made in the USA at an FDA certified facility.I received the body lotion from True for testing, evaluation and review.  Based on my experience with the product and my observations,  I would have to use this lotion for long term to notice any younger looking skin.  The bottle that I received for testing was not large enough to make that determination.  However, I did find it to be a quality moisturizer which kept my skin hydrated, therefore when used daily can definitely make a difference. So based on that, I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3444PJSN0N6N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2M425Q#wasThisHelpful","R3444PJSN0N6N5","A348W50UDP19EE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348W50UDP19EE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The womens crew neck sweater from Knit & Love is very cute and comfortable.  I ordered a medium and it fits snugly.  I personally prefer a loose fitting sweater but this sweater looks good either buttoned or unbuttoned.  I have long arms and this sweater does not fall short.  It comes all the way down, covering my wrist.  What makes this sweater unique is the detail in the buttons.  These are toggle buttons which are a golden metallic and really a nice accent.  It is like having built in jewelry.  The fabric, 65%viscose 35%nylon seems to pick up fuzz and animal fur very easily which is common for most black knitted garments.  Although it says that you can machine wash, I would probably wash it by hand and lay flat to dry to keep its shape and size.I got the sweater from Knit & Love for testing and evaluation.  Based on my personal experience I would recommend it because it is very cute with the unique buttons and styling.  It is comfortable and with the classic color and styling, goes with almost any outfit for any occasion.  My recommendation is to purchase a size larger than you normally would wear.  I ordered a medium and have a 34 bust.  It did fit but felt snug.

"You dont have to be an acne prone teenager to benefit from Insta-Naturals Skin clearing toner.  I use toner every time I wash my face.  Toner penetrates the pores and lifts out any residue left behind, whether it is makeup and oil or soap residue.  These are the things that clog pores and cause inflammation and blemishes.  I have found this toner to be a good consistency, it smells nice and not medicinal and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.  The vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, retinol and other moisturizers are an added bonus.The Insta-Natural toner along with the skin clearing serum work together to preserve the youthful appearance of skin.  Scientifically, I think that this is a great combination of skin enhancing natural ingredients.

"The joint support from Zenwise has all the natural minerals and ingredients to support your joint health.  As we get older, the cartilage in our joint break down and eventually disappears.  I know because it has happened to me.  I had started taking Glucosamine and Chondroitin for several years ago, on and off.  It does help when taken regularly.Not all supplements are created equal.  These particular tablets also have MSM and hyaluronic acid.  They also have the one of the highest potencies on the market.  The pills are quite large as are other brands, so this is normal for this type of supplement.  Suggested serving size is 3 tablets which I like to spread it out taking one at each meal.  I find that when taking them all at once, it tends to irritate my stomach which makes gives me heartburn and a bloated feeling, but that happens to me with any brand of Glucosamine supplements.  There are 180 tablets in the bottle, so taking three per day, they should last about 60 days.  Zenwise Joint Care is made in the USA under FDA regulations and has earned the GMP seal so you can be sure that it is a safe, quality product.I received the Joint Care supplements to test, evaluate and review.  My opinion, based on my experience is that it is a good product.  It helps to maintain the cartilage in your joint, lubricates them and protects them from degeneration.

"I hadnt heard of this supplement before I was approached to try it out so I wanted to know what it was and what it did, so researched the supplement.  One website said it supported cardiac health, another the immune system.  I have also read that ashwagandha helps to improve sleep, reduce brain fog and fatigue, aid in weight loss, and decrease symptoms of menopause. These are big claims for this root derivative which is related to the tomato and potato plant.The capsules are made of a gelatin and filled with ashwagandha root powder.  I have taken one every morning with my breakfast, for a few weeks.  They are easy to swallow.  I have not noticed any significant difference, however in all fairness I dont think I have been taking the ashwagandha supplements long enough to be able to give an accurate assessment.  I have type II diabetes so I was hoping that the anti-inflammatory effects of the supplement would help and maybe it will, however it is too soon to tell.  There have been no side effects or repeating aftertaste.I was given the supplements from Zenwise Labs for testing, evaluation and unbiased review.  Based on my experience, I have not seen any significant changes in my health, neither good nor bad.  Several weeks is not long enough to notice.  I will continue to take them until the 120 capsules are finished.  If there is anything to report, I will post an update.  As it stands, I am giving 4 stars because the product is made in the USA in is quality assured under the GMP seal, is all natural, packaged with a tamper resistant seal, reasonably priced for the quantity of capsules and I have experienced no side effects from the supplement;  and maybe, just maybe a little more focus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250ZSNQ0SBNRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD5G396#wasThisHelpful","R250ZSNQ0SBNRR","A348W50UDP19EE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348W50UDP19EE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Dead Sea Magnesium Oil is different than my current brand of liquid magnesium.  The one I currently use is water based and the Dead Sea Magnesium is of course oil.  I find that I prefer the Dead Sea Oil Magnesium.  It is odorless, colorless and can be massaged into the skin.  The Dead Sea oil also softens and conditions the skin as well as delivering the Magnesium.  The instructions tell you to leave it on for about 10-20 minutes and then rinse it off, however I found that I can leave it since I did not display any sensitivity issues.  It is fully absorbed by my skin and does not leave a greasy residue, just softness.There are several reasons why I take this mineral.  A friend had recommended taking magnesium supplements when I told them about leg cramps and ringing in my ears.  At that time, I took tablets which take longer to absorb.  After some time, I did notice that it helped to minimize the frequency of those two annoyances.  I have since learned that it is also good for stress and to promote relaxation and sleep.  That explains why I fall asleep soon after my head hits the pillow.  My husband always remarks about it and quite frankly I think he is envious.I received the Dead Sea Magnesium Oil from Magnum Solace for testing, evaluation an unbiased review.  In my opinion, this is a high quality, potent product that is beneficial to your well-being and safe to use.

"The craft tags from Marrywindix are made well and cut precisely.  I got two neat stacks of 50 in each bundle for a total of 100 tags, along with jute twine for fastening.

The punch out holes are large enough to easily thread the twine through without difficulty and can be cut to the desired length.  These will be great for Mason jar gifts of mix kits, candy or jams.  I always make a few of these for teachers, neighbors, and friends.  You can label the contents on one side and write instructions on the other.I am also using them to attach to spare keys.

The teardrop design has a double row of cubic zirconia which catch the light and add sparkle to the piece.  It is 18K white gold plated which makes it a little better then costume jewelry.  It feels smooth with no rough edges and is very attractive.  The clasp is lobster claw style, making it easy to put on yourself.  I am not sure what the link type of the chain would be called but I can tell you that the links are very different than most chains and seems to be strong.

"I have tried my greatest to find a diecast B-47 around the world, a metal toy about 1/125th scale, and failed. The B-47, which is more the star of this film than Jimmy Stewart, was America's first true jet bomber in the Cold War and the most beautiful jet ever made. It was a short-lived stopgap between the postwar B-36 and the still in service B-52, the most enduring weapon of the Cold War or just about any other period in history.In the film, Jimmy Stewart gets recalled from pro baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals to air duty and has some angst with his wife over it. She wants him home, not out fighting communisits. He did enough of that during the war, she says. By contrast, the Air Force loves him and thinks he's great, especially his boss, Frank Lovejoy. They say he's a fine pilot with magnificent leadership qualities. Stewart has some internal dissension over this and determines which way he'll go with it -- to his wife's chagrin. Later action in the film makes that decision for him, however.There, I talked about the movie. Now back to the B-47. It's smoky and steamy takeoffs are a thing of real beauty and are exploited to the maximum in Strategic Air Command. Those takeoffs always reminds me of life in the 1950s living next to the railroad tracks when the steam engines would roar through our little town 100 MPH carrying 60 boxcars. They'd spew so much steam and soot in the air the clothes hanging on my mom's outdoor clothesline would have to washed again!For those on you that have never seen this movie or the B-47, it was a lovely, silver, swept-wing combat bomber that used outriggers under the engines to steady it -- since it only had two large sets of wheels under the front and back. This added much to the beauty and line of the aircraft.Back to the movie -- this is hardly Jimmy Stewart's greatest film; it probably isn't among his 25 greatest films. I thought the action and plot somewhat stilted and deliberate, actually. Not much ever happens until the final scene when there's action on a plane and Stewart does his best to make you act as worried as he seems to be. But it's faux danger, we all know that. Otherwise, there is nothing to distinguish this from any other mediocre peacetime Cold War-era film made that decade.It is, however, the best way ever to see lots of B-47s and see them in action. To me, that is the enduring feature of Strategic Air Command. Now if only someone somewhere would make a diecast toy of a B-47!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LE71E5Y2O4WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008K15OIE#wasThisHelpful","R3LE71E5Y2O4WN","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the Berg concerto, which I downloaded. I neither purchased nor listened to the Beethoven.As it regards Alban Berg's violin concerto written ""to the memory of an angel"" -- the 18-year-old Manon Gropius, daughter of Alma Mahler (the composer's widow) and Walter Gropius -- German violinist Antje Weithaas may set a new performance standard for the piece. Far from the raging desolation most violinists project when recording the concerto, Weithaas, abetted similarly by the Stavanger (Norway) Symphony Orchestra conducted by music director Steven Sloane, creates a threnody that expresses profound sadness.Compared to the commissioned version with Louis Krasner on the fiddle and Anton Webern conducting, this rendition is quieter and more contemplative than theirs or just about any other. Weithaas takes a bit more than 25 minutes to complete the concerto compared to 29 minutes for Krasner. Most versions recorded now are in the 25-27 minute range.Special mention should be given to Weithaas' bowing and the phrasing of the orchestra under its leader. The woodwind and brass figures that support the orchestral strings follow more incisively and logically here than in other recordings I know, including those from Ivry Gitlis, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Pinchas Zukerman. Under the Weithaas-Sloane collaboration, these don't sound like 12 tone rows; they sound like traditional melodies from the romantic Berg.There is nearly a complete absence of the random noise that results from many performances when volume equals passion. There is plenty of ardor here, but gently stated -- even during the raucous opening of the second movement. Where most performances project an angry sorrow, this is clearly calculated to result in an utterance of deep sadness that fulfills Berg's mourning.In this vein, the performance is much more like Mahler's songs on the death of children, Kindertotenlieder, and his expression of a child's  version of heaven in his Symphony No 4. Like those predecessors, there is a lack of volume, bow pressure and other musical affects usually associated with Berg's concerto. The pacing adds to this affect, especially in the ultra-quiet closing section where Weithaas's line is almost threadbare.Not buying the CD I have no notes, biographical information or documentation on the recording date(s) or place(s). The CAVI-MUSIC website said it was released Nov. 15, 2013 and Weithaas's bio on the Karsten Witt Music Management webpage suggests she has recorded and played a number of other ""modern"" concertos including those by Jrg Widmann (born 1973,) Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Ligeti, Gubaidulina, Korngold, Hartmann and Schoeck.The downloaded sound is 5 X 5 X 5 with everything fairly close and a natural placement of the violin in the orchestra. Like most modern recordings, you can hear a lot more than you probably would hear in the concert hall, especially in the orchestra, which sounds like a chamber ensemble.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOBVG7YS7PZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ97VRG#wasThisHelpful","R1NOBVG7YS7PZK","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Napoleon is famously credited with saying history is lies agreed upon, a truism proved every new century through historians' mirrors over the last 100 years' history. This book, like other re-histories that have cropped up in the last 20 years, proves again that Napoleon, while probably not correct is his assessment, was on the right track.In The Untold History of the United States, their mate to the Showtime television series, filmmaker Oliver Stone and collaborator Peter Kuzniak have re-told American history since World War II to show America a far less generous and wonderful country than you may have learned in your grade school, high school or college history courses. The authors use actual historical events to show an America at odds with much of the world, supporting tyrannies, and using its military might to exploit lesser nations' wealth and promote American self-interest. This isn't the only such history that exists these days.Being born 1950, going through school in the 1950s and 1960s and college in the 1970s, I was taught a very different history about the United States than the one you'd learn if you took a class in community college today. Probably the greatest reinterpretation is the America of the 19th century. In my day, we were taught America was a self-evident leader whose manifest destiny was to lead the world through promoting democracy and goodwill post World War II, and that its 19th century growth in the West set the pace for this leadership. American exceptionalism, it came to be known.Today, you'd learn 19th century America did indeed thrive, but not through goodwill or democracy -- that its growth was constucted on a foundation of genocide. The European-Americans that settled the country put in place laws and pogroms that decimated native Americans (we used to call them Indians) while kidnapping, enslaving and carrying out holocaust against African-Americans brought to America in chains. The Civil War of 1961-65 was supposed to level the ground but historians now teach it took another century to even begin to right these immoralities.There are parallels in 20th century and one American history taught today skewers ideas once set in stone. In my youth -- after World War II and during the Cold War -- we learned the Second World War ended because the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, who then immediately surrendered. While not demonstrated as directly in this book as in Five Myths About Nuclear Weapons, there is today a counter history promoted in some circles.That history is Japan surrendered in World War II not because of the A-bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but because the Soviet Union had entered the war, was storming through Manchuria, and threatening to invade and occupy Japan. Historians have produced letters from Japanese political and military leaders demonstrating such fear of this that the country gave up and acceded to Allied demands for unconditional surrender. They didn't care about the A-bombs, this theory carries, because all their cities had been destroyed. So what is two more bombs were dropped and Truman promised more?History isn't just rewritten in America, either. The Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest creative minds in classical music history, died 1791 from what for years was thought to be scarlett fever. Today, withouth the benefit of gene discovery or an autopsy, his death is attributed to everything from smallpox, rheumatic fever, medical malpractice, strep throat and  hypochondria.The point is history is fluid, not static, and it is re-realized, reinterpreted and rewritten at least every 100 years based on new evidence and ideas. Stone's and Kuzniak's book is a reinterpretation of postwar history that arrives at a viewpoint not considered earlier in American times. Is everything they write correct? Possibly not. But it's clear all the historical events they describe actually happened even though the context they discuss the events in is probably different than you may have heard before.As to the more damning notions that the authors contend America was on the ""wrong"" side of World War II and the Cold War,  these are polemic arguments. What cannot be contested is that America did not always support democracy and goodwill, especially during the Cold War, and that much of the motivation for its foreign policy after World War II through the fall of the Berlin Wall was based in self-interest and fantasy.Its clear at least some of America's Cold War foreign policy was directed to save the American way of life. That is the only possible reason America through the CIA supported the fascist coup of an elected communist government in Chile circa 1973 and supported the Shah of Iran, whose policies were anything but democratic. There was no democracy in Vietnam for America to support during its long war there. And carrying out foreign policy against the idea that multinational communism was a threat to the United States and its way of life was never proven correct in Korea, Vietnam or any other conflict we entered from 1946-89.With respect to Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and everyone else that got some credit for ending the Cold War, communism in Europe failed on its own because it wasn't economically viable. With someone like Gorbachev coming to power, communism would eventually have failed had we never sent any troops to Vietnam, Korea or Germany. The proof of this is communism still exists in the world today in a few small nations but our monolithic enemy is today thought to be Muslim-based terrorism, the reason we have entered the new Crusades.And while I believe we were on the ""right"" side of World War II, it's clear we carried out war crimes in doing so. In the film of his life The Fog Of War, World War II political strategist and Vietnam-era Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara admitted American leadership would have been tried for war crimes had the Allies lost the war.McNamara said Tokyo was one of 67 Japanese cities, mostly made of wood buildings, that American forces fire-bombed with incendiaries late in the war for the purpose of inciting terror and forcing the Japanese to surrender in order to save the estimated million lives that would have been lost by invading Japan. The Americans and British also carried out terror bombings on hundreds of thousands of noncombatants in Germany during the war, most famously in Dresden, a city with no war production or military purpose.But war is hell, we all know that, and lots of innocents pay the price for war. I think this is one of the fundamental messages of this book: that lots of innocents paid the price for American imperialism after the war, and not always to support democracy, God and/or goodwill. A lot of times it was to support U.S. Steel, AT&T and our other multinational corporations around the world. The authors clearly believe in heroes and failures in American history and it isn't hard to figure out whom they are. Perhaps their greatest hero is former Commerce Secretary and vice-president Henry Wallace, whom most historians believe a ""Red"" in the White House. These guys think Wallace, had he been the 1948 candidate fro president instead of Truman, would have led the world in a very different direction than the Cold War ethos practiced by the U.S.A. from 1946-89.The book has other curiosities you'll find along the way that conflict with other histories you may know of postwar America. One things this book has that most other do not is exceptional readability. In its best pages, the authors move through a morass of tales swiftly and easily, rarely bogging down the reader even thought they mix metaphors and commingle historical stories readily and often. The book reads fast, to put it briefly, and it is usually very entertaining even if you are infuriated by some of what it says.So this book is one history among many, perhaps more modern than some, as valid as most and far more entertaining that just about any other. When approached in this light, I think this book is valuable, especially as a foil to the highly entertaining series of programs carried in its name on Showtime last autumn even though the book has flaws a-plenty. There's probably something in it you haven't read before, as well, making it worth your time and money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPISD4GD2B3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451613512#wasThisHelpful","R2RPISD4GD2B3G","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coming in show in the choral symphony sweepstakes behind Beethoven's 9th and Mahler's Resurrection, Mendelssohn's Lobgesang is oddity cantata wrapped inside a symphony. Unlike its predecessor and descendent, the hymn of praise exhibits Mendelssohn's enduring faith in God while Beethoven's is a secular exclamation and Mahler's expresses his hope there is a heavenly landing place.There have been a goodly number of Lobgesangs over the years that, while many were highly thought of in some circles, were sunk by a characteristic or two. Most often, a weak tenor sinks the ship -- as it did in a couple of Naxos versions. Other times, quicksilver turns the proceedings to syrup. Elsewhere, there doesn't seem to be much understanding of what the music is about by famous conductors or those of less imagination. More often, a certain blandness carries the day.Only a handful have been consistently successful from start to finish, in my view. Foremost among them is Dohnanyi whose fine 1970s concoction is  exquisitely sung by a wonderful team of soloists with unsentimental. dramatic leadership that gets to the heart of Mendelssohn's counterpoint. Another exceptional version with many of the same qualities is from the young Claus Peter Flor, one of the best Mendelssohn interpreters extant.What I like about this one is Christoph Spering's mercurial leadership mated to the beautiful singing of sopranos Soile Isokoski and Mechthild Bach and tenor Frieder Lang, all of whom translate the messages of Christian love, faith and redemption gloriously. Eschewing any idea of Victorian excess, Spering gets through the whole thing in about 65 minutes, enough time to say everything effecitvely while allowing the singers plenty of leash in their solos. This is a minute or two faster than Dohnanyi and quite a bit more rapid than the more centrist Abbado.The dispirited downside to Spering's version is it seems no longer available. Old liners disusted by period performance probably enjoy that but to others it is an inconsolable loss in a field for years dominated by bland, unfocused musicianship in one of Mendelssohn's least-recorded major choral works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR76J0ZEW6T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005W3D#wasThisHelpful","R1RR76J0ZEW6T5","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made four decades back via bastardizing a Japanese novel, this film treatment is more Henry Miller and Oedipus than Eastern culture.While the novel focused on the sailor's vision of his future at sea and the way it was compromised by his affiar with the widow, this capitalized on 1970s sexuality zeitgiest in film exploiting the relationship between the sailor and widow against the Oedipal foil of the son who, abetted by a Lord Of the Flies-type club of upper class school boys, exacts revenge on the sailor in the end.The film is full of sexual symbols, none greater than the boys' meeting place. It won't shock anyone in 2014 except those that have read the book and fall asleep waiting for something to happen in the first hour of the movie.

"Clearly inspired by Charles Whitman's 1966 shooting rampage at the University of Texas, ""Targets"" is an ultra-realistic view of mental instability, murder and human interaction that resulted in a bunch of people being killed and other lives ruined. It's also a first and last of sorts, being Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film, one of later-director Samuel Fuller's first screenplays, and actor Boris Karloff's last film.The plot of ""Targets"" revolves around the protagonist's mild-mannered demeaner and home life, which suddenly turns sour when he first shoots his mother, then his wife -- repeating the exact sequence of Whitman's real-world killings in Texas. The plot then varies from what really happened as the shootings move to other places than a university tower building. The main subplot is actor Karloff's career winding down and an upcoming personal appearance at a drive-in movie that happens to coincide with the exciting final scene of the film, where shooter, targets and Karloff all interact.This is a fine and disturbing film to watch, made all the more so by its mimic of real-life events from just a year earlier -- and produced on a cheapie budget. Bogdanovich casts the whole thing in ultra-realism; there is no Hollywood gloss, no stilted script, no fakes in the actors or prima donnas outside of Karloff playing himself. The locations in the low-budget thriller are also real-world.The black and white print is a little gritty but it hardly detracts from your involvement. This is an outstanding, hard to watch drama and a notch in the bedpost for everyone involved, first, last or othewise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5EL525GLJUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009RXKC#wasThisHelpful","R2F5EL525GLJUO","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree completely with this review:While this is a nice, thoroughly enjoyable performance of the symphony, there are many currently available recordings that are as good or better. Gandolfi's reading is direct and tautly rhythmic in the two last movements, but the orchestra lacks the sheen and finesse that makes the first movement so magical in recordings like those of Beecham, Wand, and others. Still, I don't think anyone would find this reading disappointing.The performance of the Mass is, however, a winner. Here, the small forces, the unpretentious sound of the chorus, and the fresh-voiced soloists (unnamed on the recording) suggest the choir loft more than the recording studio. The simplicity of approach works beautifully in this music, especially in the Benedictus where the three solo voices combined with the small orchestra produce an intimacy more often found in chamber music than in settings of the Mass. The sound of the recording is very good and the notes are informative.Richard Burke for Fanfare magazine 1995","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGIKJE23KOTQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000221S#wasThisHelpful","RGIKJE23KOTQH","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Organist and conductor Martin Haselbrock has turned himself into a Franz Liszt specialist, recording the composer's symphonic poems and Dante symphony and, here, a half-dozen of his Hungarian Rhapsodies. Liszt wrote the rhapsodies for solo piano and/or piano duet in the middle 1800s, then returned to the form again later in the century. He also orchestrated them though some of these were orchestrated by Franz Doppler. Liszt wrote the rhapsodies based on native Hungarian music and dances played by gypsy bands.Haselbrock, whose recordings of the tone poems lack fire and imagination, does a better job here though these are hardly incendiary. His is a concert music approach that focuses on structure, melody and counterpoint in opposition to the highest spirits, similar to those who take ballet music and make it into concert (instead of dance) music. You hear this uniformly through the six rhapsodies in the collection including the famous Nos. 1 in F minor and 2 in D minor.When I listen to these I am more aware of the composer's symphonic poems than dance music. The opening notes of rhapsody No. 1 remind me more of the opening phrase of Hunnenschlact -- albeit with a lot less emotion -- than any dance music I know. At the other end of the recording, rhapsody No. 6 opens as more a stroll in the park than unrefined gypsy dance -- and never really becomes the latter even in the final rollicking moments. In comparison to the likes of Georg Solti, I'd say that's true for the entire collection.While the musicmaking isn't as good as elsewhere, what makes this album worthy and collectible is Haselbrock's connection to his period band, the Vienna Academy Orchestra. This is the same group with which he recorded the symphonic poems only this time they show more life. Many have commented on the sound of the orchestra with its small bore brass, gut strings and period woodwinds. I heard some of this the first time I played the record but on repreated listening find the period instruments neither a distraction nor an improvement over recordings using modern instruments.One thing for sure: Haselbrock has kept the vulgarity level way down in his band compared to Hungarians like Solti and/or the young Zubin Mehta who played it to the hilt in recordings of Liszt's orchestral music.This, then, is a civilized, even elegant, version of Liszt's dances (rhapsodies, sorry) that is more like an afternoon pops concert than a visit to a gypsy camp. If is subtly yet effectively delivered, highly musical and well-played. Some people would call this an ""English"" enunciation of Hungarian music where the failure to be gentlemanly is always avoided. If that's what you're after you'll enjoy this recording. Be advised, however, this is hardly a gypsy reading that lacks fire and doesn't linger in the memory like some others.CPO provides 24 pages of multilingual essays on the music and players, notes and documentation on the 2012 recordings including a complete list of the orchestral players, photos and bios of the band and conductor. This is part of the ""Sound of Weimar"" series of Liszt works from Haselbrock and his group that started on the Naxos and NCA (New Classical Adventures) labels. Now is has moved to full-priced CPO in what is probably the best of these adventures, which to this point have in my opinion been well-executed but unexciting and largely forgettable.Haselbrock the organist has also released a collection of Liszt's organ music that may or may not still be available new.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2JY2Q4FBAT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEROPEI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2JY2Q4FBAT6","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though once recommended by the dearly departed Penguin Guide, in this age, when magnificent performances of Mendelssohn's Elijah are everywhere, this recording with nondescript Willard White in the lead role and Richard Hickox conducting without passion or direction is, at best, a mediocrity.How this recording ever got any plaudits is a wonder to me. For whatever reason, they should have died when Bryn Terfel's characterization of Elijah came along in Paul Daniel's 1990-something recording, for everyone knew then what the biblcial prophet was supposed to sound like. White, whose singing is consistently characterized by notes starting lower than their value, has a strong bass voice but is hardly the essence of Elijah.While Terfel stole the show as Elijah, Daniel's often unimaginative leadership and his cast of less than stellar singers left the door open for the old standby with some of the greatest singers in history -- the Fruhbeck De Burgos recording on EMI with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the title role backed up by the likes of Janet Baker, Nicolai Gedda and Gwyneth Jones, a recording with singers for the ages.Even with the ascent of the new Elijah under Paul McCreesh with Simon Keenlyside as Elijah -- in a recording that tries to recreate the English oratorio tradition of having singers in the hundreds perform -- Fruebeck De Burgos still has the best sung version whether or not you like Fish Dish in the leading role. For period performance mavens, the choice probably falls to Terfel and Daniel. In this forest of new and old recorded Elijahs, this one is definitely in the shade.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15B2PWB0I76Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AJE#wasThisHelpful","R15B2PWB0I76Z4","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The classical music industry, which some say is in death throes, sometimes confuses me. While it sets out to record the umpteenth version of Beethoven and Mahler symphonies, it doesn't seem interested in bringing back tried and true classics like Eugene Ormandy's LP of Sibelius tone poems, never quite equaled elsewhere in the industry.Eugene Ormandy, the long-time director of the Philadelphia Orchestra who maintainted the ""Philadelphia sound"" started in the 1930s by Leopold Stokowski, made these recordings in 1953 amd 1955. The contents are Jean Sibelius's En Saga, Op.9, Pohjola's Daughter, Op.49, Oceanides, Op.73 and Tapiola, Op.112, some of the composer's most well-known and best-loved Scandinavian tone poems.Ormandy's work in those days was characterized by passion and tempo relationships that were just right, far more so than his later recordings of Sibelius that became more measured, less passionate and much slower. These readings have an urgency and appeal people that only know the conductor from his stereo days won't understand.Columbia, now Sony, never released this LP on CD though both American Haydn House and France-based Pristine Classical will burn a CD for you on demand. Both recreate the music from analog sources, not from original tapes. Either is acceptable if you can't find the LP which has exemplary sound and depth. Sibelius lovers that don't know this music should remedy that immeidately here or elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CQX45TXVTMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q72BM6#wasThisHelpful","R30CQX45TXVTMY","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to side with the people that love this machine for it's the best washing machine we've owned in our 35-year-old household. It does a great job on clothes, especially whites using the white cycle; they've never looked better. The accompanying dryer is just as good.We've owned our machine 3 years, bought it new, and have never had service on it. It does 4-5 loads of laundry a week, usually on two different days, and has never failed. Since we converted from the old mechanically-driven washer whose tub was full of water to this electronic model that uses only a few gallons of water, there was a learning curve. We found you cannot overload this washer; indeed it works best with small loads. You have to follow the instructions in the accompanying booklet and do what it tells you to do. You have to leave the ""eye"" open at the bottom of the tank if you want the laundry to come out well.While I can understand some of the people here than complain about breakdowns -- we also bought a Whirlpool refrigerator the same time we bought this washer and dryer and had to have it repaired once -- I cannot understand the people who say this is a piece of junk and/or doesn't work well. Our experience is exactly the opposite. This machine not only works well, it works 10 times better than any we've ever owned -- providing you use the correct detergent, fabric softerner and bleach and use the appropriate amounts and providing you adhere to the instructions Whirlpool gives in the manual.One other thing: we did a major home improvement three years ago and switched all our major appliances to water- and electricity-saving models at the time. Primarily because of this washer, our water bill went down about 25 percent in a period where our municipality raised our rates. Our electrical bill also declined every year since we redid our appliances. We did not add a new furnace at the time (we live in Michigan where a furnace is a necessity) and in fact own a 50-year-old furnace that is about as inefficient as possible.So here's a BIG vote of confidence for this machine that works wonderfully in our household. If you are having trouble getting laundry clean with yours, I'd recommend you read your owner's manual and follow the instructions, then try again. And DON'T OVERLOAD the thing since that could force water into the electronics inside the cylinder. This machine works best with small loads, so cut your loads in half if you are washing a lot of clothers all the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOHV80WKBJWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JN143C#wasThisHelpful","ROOHV80WKBJWG","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anton Bruckner's Mass No. 2 is the lead item here, a piece he penned in 1866 and revised later. The German contributer to the abruckner.com website said the revision was done 1882 while the notes to the original LP of this performance pegged the revision in 1885. In either case, the revision tightened the drama and changed the number of measures in some movements, remaking the opening Kyrie more unifrom with other sections. In this recording, the Kyrie runs 7:05 while the following movements are between 5 minutes and 9:05.Hans Gillesberger's 1964 conception is both dramatic and reverant. His opening Kyrie ranks with any I know for clarity of voicing and austere, religious conviction. It gets better after that, too. The whole thing glows from beginning to end and is sung magnificently by the then-named Vienna Kammerchor (chamber choir) assisted by the woodwinds and brass of the so-named Vienna State Opera Orchestra. There's always been a contention these were pickup bands used to make recordings in Vienna. Others say the orchestra is a shortened version of Viennese players including many who play in the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.In any case, the woodwind & brass band (there are no strings in this mass) isn't the issue; the singing is the issue and, on that mark, this is an outstanding recording of a Bruckner masterpiece with reverence in the beginnig, elation closing the central Benedictus section. The recording is ideally clear, allowing you to clearly hear all four parts of the chorus (there are no soloists) recorded seemingly somewhat ahead of the band. The notes talk about Bruckner's life and a little about the mass, telling you some of what I've said here. The recording includes three shorter motets -- Ave Maria, Locus iste and Os justi, all written in similar voicing and style to the mass.As a latent Brucknerite and choral singer, I love for this music, would go to heaven to perform it, and have collected many versions of it over the years. This one, for me, ranks with the best I know including Frieder Bernius' similar program and the exceptionally reverential version from Eugen Jochum that was once available individually on a DG long-playing record but today can be had via download or in Jochum's collection of all three Bruckner masses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9TU8X3K4MWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004T0M3#wasThisHelpful","RK9TU8X3K4MWL","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am 5-11, 195 pounds and generally wear a size large or extra large top for biking or triathlons. I have bought a lot of these things online at Amazon and other places and often been disappointed by the fit, which is ridiculously small. One of my last failed efforts was with Blue Seventy Men's TX2000 Tri Singlet from 2012 that was one sale cheap because it was a year old. The fit on this was so small it was almost humorous. I'm unsure if a child could wear a ""men's"" large!By contrast, the Sugoi Men's Sonic Tri Tank fits me -- almost. While I normally wear a size large, I had to buy the XXL size to do it but at least I can get it on my body. The coverage is good thouhg there's some rise at the midriff when I am exercising; however, the fabric is almost unbelievably soft and comfortable, it stretches wonderfully in every direction, and the thing is airy, light and just a great product for doing anything rigorous outdoors in warm (or hot or not so warm) weather.

"""Damsels In Distress"" appears to be a contemporary film about modern college life on the surface but underneath lurks a throwback screwball comedy to an era when films like this starred Cary Grant and were directed by Howard Hawks. The plot of this thinly-disguised reverb revolves around four college women running a suicide prevention center and using dancing as therapy for those so lovelorn or torn by conflict they may want to end it all. To satisfay modern sensibilities, it spends some time in their socialization with men. However, the dancing subplot (wait until you see the end!) should give anyone under age 50 a clue this film isn't about modern times but a refelction of the not-so-near past.If that's not enough, the film eschews all the trappings of modern college films. There are no sex scenes, no topless women, no bimbos, few idiotic young men living out of a beer bottle, almost no predictable scenes, and just about none of the cliches that usually surround college age film in the new century (or the latter part of last century.) This film is instead a sober, almost understated, comedy about being young and growing up, turns in life, mild conflicts, subtle humor, sensitivity and making lemonade when handed lemons.It was very pleasing to see such a fine film among the trash that usually passes for filmmaking today. Not a single time did I have to witness a cheerleader, jock, BMOC or other cliches in a college film. In contrast, there was often intelligent humor and conversation substituted for profanity and other R-rated tactics meant to draw in the younger audience seeking titilation. Without the apparent trappings, it's a curiosity to whom the film is intended. My guess is it is people seeking highly creative entertainment with elements of both fantasy and real-life. If that's you, go for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAB274YUEYXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081FSMII#wasThisHelpful","R3IAB274YUEYXR","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My mother died earlier this year with a trust and I was the designated trustee. She was not wealthy so there was not a large estate. My sister, brother and I were the beneficiaries and we divided what little property and assets she left without discord in accordance with her will and written wishes.This was a very easy process to manage, from my perspective. Even transferring ownership of her home from her to the trust to another relative only took two visits to the trust attorney and two visits to the county Register of Deeds where the property was located to file two different quit claim deeds (the latter could have been done by phone, web or mail also.) The whole thing cost a few hundred dollars in filing fees and lawyer fees (a lawyer wrote the quit claim deeds.) I don't know what mom paid the lawyer to write the trust in the first place.This book, Make Your Own Living Trust, asserts it will provide you will all the tools to do all this yourself without hiring an attorney. The book has 238 pages of text and another 75 or so pages of forms you need to file, such as the quit claim deeds I filed to transfer ownership of my mom's house. This book is also connected to a website where you can download forms.Having gone through the process of being a trustee, I thought this book might help me file my own trust. However, I found an error in it as early as page 6 where it says: ""No court proceedings or papers are required to terminte the trust. Once the job of getting the property to theb eneficiareis is accomplished, the trust just evaporates, by its own terms.""This is not true. When I became trustee, I had to file with the IRS for an employer ID number. This is a formality and does not indicate I was an employer, though some trustees apparently do have employees. Like the precept of this book, the IRS posted on its website how easy it was to acquire and employer ID number following their online process. Only it didn't work for me and I had to call them.It wasn't hard to get the number -- just a brief chat with an IRS agent and answering a couple questions, then submitting a form and you have the number. However, the IRS agent told me I had to file a report by the end of 2014 to terminate the trust. I can't do that until I file my mother's 2013 taxes next year. So much for this book's idea taht nothing is necessary to terminate a trust!I haven't otherwise read the whole book so I can't comment on everything else inside. Most people around here seem to like it and my overview indicates it has a lot of information inside. However, it's hard not to be skeptical of something that includes an error on the sixth page. I would also add that our trust attorney provided us with recommendations on how to deal with creditors after mom's death. I didn't see anything in this book about that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6W9RSA5VH9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1413318355#wasThisHelpful","RH6W9RSA5VH9B","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the C minor requiem that so impressed Beethoven he had it played at his own funeral. Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842) was among the earliest romantic composers and used emotion in his opera and choral music in ways that would suit Napoleon and later influence the romantic Beethoven, the classically-inclined Brahms, and the new romantic voice of Richard Wagner.His requiem is heard here in an outstanding period performance by the New Orchestra and Christoph Spering, mated with Cherubini's wonderfully soulful and beautiful funeral device, ""In Paradisum"", a short piece about life in paradise that is sometimes played to conclude the requiem.Cherubini's masterwork is in 8 movements -- Itroitus, Graduale, Dies irae, Offertorium, Sanctus, Pie Jesu and Agnus Dei. The days of wrath section builds monumentally from a slow beginning to a titanic pronouncement while the concluding Agnus Dei does much the same before closing the matter...or leading into the gently spiritual view of paradise. There are no soloes in the requiem; the chorus has full reign the entire time.The otherwordly In Paradisum says this:""Into paradise may the angels lead youand may the holy martyrswelcome you and lead youin the holy city of Jerusalem.May the choirs of the angels welcome you,and, with Lazarus, once poor,may you find eternal rest.""Lazarus of Bethany, according to the biblical Gospel of John, died and was restored to life four days later by a miracle of Christ.

Muti is a bit more emotional but the sound is miles below this and the execution by both players and singers is not as well enunciated as in Spering's performance that's a fair example of period practice circa 1994 -- a bit ascetic for some tastes but fine for others.There are other recordings of the requiem with a profile but none I know that link it to In Paradisum.

"David Hall's The Record Book International Edition is a follow-up on his original tome (advertised here) that came out when most collectors were still listening to 78s and LPs were in their infancy. Hall's book was perhaps the first effort in America to tell collectors what was available and to provide grades for the best recordings they could buy. This followed The Record Guide by English authors Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor that did same overseas. Their books led to development of Penguin Stereo Record Guide from Edward Greenfield et al that eventually became the now-defunct The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music.Hall's book laments the relatively few recordings available of many now well-recorded composers like Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner, whose mammoth symphonies are now routinely all recorded. Hall also spends the first 200 pages of the book (Part 1, he called it) explaining the recording industry, helping his readers better buy recordings, and giving the reader an inside look at musical history, especially the pre-Bach era.Hall is an everpresent guide through recordings and musical history in the pages of this fascinating book. His comments on the Mahler 9th symphony, which was not a popular composition after World War II when this book was in circulation, are telling. ""In the Ninth Symphony,"" Hall says, ""we come face-to-face with a different Mahler from the exhuberant nature poet of the First and Fourth (symphonies) or the musical dramatist of the Second and Fifth. The Mahler of the Ninth Symphony, as of the Lied von der Erde song-cycle, is a poet, sick and idsillusioned and read to bid farewell to mankind...looking to death as a welcome release from earthly trial.""In the light of history and knowledge we've learnd about Mahler in the succeeding 65 years (my book was signed by its owner on August 6, 1948) these words may be slightly innocous or naive but still pretty much hit Mahler's work on its head: the composer vastly influenced by nature, God-worship and his own affectations of death related to deaths of his childhood siblings, daughter and his own heart condition. I doubt many musicologists were writing this about Gustav Mahler -- now our most popularly-recorded symphonist -- in 1948.In the same section, Hall praises the recordings of Mahler's 4th Symphony under Bruno Walter, with Desi Halban doing the solo singing, and Walter's collaboration wiht Charles Kullman and Kerstin Thorborg in Song of the Earth, recordings reinvented by Antante in their celebrated series of 78 reissues.Like Herbert Russcol's fabulous Guide to Low-Priced Classical Records and David Ewen's Musical Masterworks, as well as Sackville-West and Greenfield in Europe, Hall leads today's reader and record collector through the history of recordings, including many he recommends that returned in some form in the digital era. The lesson here should be clear to anyone that cares about music: today's new releases, while they may sound better and come in modern wrapping, really have nothing on yesterday's classics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EZXD9F7VDCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H4KEDC#wasThisHelpful","R33EZXD9F7VDCG","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a foggy recording to average woodwind execution, here is yet another in the endless list of overrated recordings from Sabine Meyer and friends, this time doing a couple of Richard Strauss's wind arrangements and the Dvorak serenade for winds op. 44.I first became acquainted with Meyer and her cohorts in their Krommer Octet-Partitas where all the same faults became obvious: playing that lacks zest and life accompanied by a foggy recording that merges all the instruments into one big mass, as if the 1970s rage of homogenization was back in vogue.There are far better recordings of all these works, not least of which for the Strauss is the exciting and much better recorded by Ensemble Villa Musica for MD&G where, in Vol. 1, you can hear the chamber arrangement of Til Eulenspiegel with the Sonatina in E flat major known as the ""Happy Workshop.""The irony of the latter piece has always felled me since it was written while Allied bombers were pounding Struass's hometown of Dresden to rubble during the closing days of World War II, yet it carries the signature happy.In any event, look for Ensemble Villa Musica in these Strauss scores and the Nash Ensembler for the Dvork and relegate this recording where it belongs: somewhere else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDJNLV0T7JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H4VX9Q#wasThisHelpful","RRDJNLV0T7JZ","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chinese manufacturer of this very expensive product must have no concept of the size of American people. I ordered this in the size I normally do, mens large. I am 5-11 and 195 pounds with a 16 inch sleeve and 42 inch chest. I typically wear a large though sometimes I have to buy extra large. The sizing info on this product says I would wear a large.When I received this product, it was so small I could not put it on my body. It was at least 3-4 inches too short for my torso and it wasn't wide enought to fit over my shoulders! I thought surely it must be a child's size. The label, however, said L for large. I called the vendor about a return. The representative said many people have to ""size up quite a bit"" to get one that fits. I'm quite sure I could not buy one of these large enough to fit me.This looks like a nice product and the material seems fine. I bought it because it is very difficult to find this kind of product in navy blue. This isn't the first time I've tried to buy something that wouldn't even fit my size 6 adult daughter so I don't blame the vendor.

"Jill and Karen Sprecher, who co-wrote a dozen episodes of HBO's silly, laughable parody of Mormons, Big Love, here create their own paean to the Coen brothers' Fargo, doing just about everything possible to ensure viewers who've seen it know this is Fargo 2. Among the plot devices and directorial contrivances the Sprechers borrowed from the Coens for this film include:-- Location. While Fargo took place in North Dakota and Minnesota, Thin Ice takes place in Wisconsin.-- Weather. Both films had actors complaining about cold, snowy winter weather.-- Plot contrivances. Fargo had the killer doing away with someone in long-term parking, claiming he was taking a trip to Florida. In Thin Ice, one of the cast members takes a trip.-- Lack of integrity. In Fargo, the leading man was a car salesman in debt. In Thin Ice, the leading man is an insurance salesman in debt. Both try to skirt the law as a way to get out of debt.There are many more obvious similarities from the tone of the production to the slow intial build-up to the series of misadventures that turns an insurance salesman's dilemma about thievery into a free-for-all wacky mystery-black comedy.Had the Coen brothers never created Fargo, Thin Ice would probably have succeeded. It has a strong cast with Greg Kinnear in the lead role and Alan Arkin playing the object of his illegal ardor. Billy Crudup is pretty good as a nincompoop home security salesman playing essentially the same part Peter Stormare played in Fargo.The movie is interesting from the opening scene, also, and builds well for about 75 minutes to quite a climax. However, the final five minutes of Thin Ice is a failure as the writers and director simply try to jam too much plot twist into too small a time frame, giving viewers no ability to absorb all the changes in such a brief time frame. This lack of subtlety and planning is the downfall of many a good film -- the failure to know how to close out a good thing.If you're in the mood for a mystery of the Fargo ilk, Thin Ice will probably fit the bill. It's an interesting, sometimes involving, dark comedy of errors that pile up and become something quite different at the end. Had the denouement been handled better, this could have been a much better film. As it is, it joins the throng of copies of great films destined to be forgotten on the scrap pile of Hollywood history.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSMPFPTTMUTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RKFXUS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSMPFPTTMUTS","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the other reviewer's three star rating of this recording but not the content of his review. I don't find the sound per se at fault; I find the playing and the sound of the instruments to be the deciding factors.The sound is OK; it is fair super audio. The reason the strings sound weak is twofold: first, these concertos are played one-to-a-part in the orchestral sections, meaning the ""orchestra"" could be as few as a half-dozen or less isntruments. More important, these are period strings making the typical yawning or wheezing sound. To me, this distracted my enjoyment of the musicmaking, which I would call average for the most part.The playing by soloist Rachel Podger and members of the band is OK; it eschews the sometimes Speedy Gonzales tempos some period practitioners use. However, this recording provided exponentially less enjoyment for me every time I played it because of the wheezing sound of the instruments, the one-to-a-part orchestra that lacked body, weight and volume, and a generally bland, affect-less presentation most of the time...or a presentation that lacked expression or personality. It could have been a computer playing this music.I bought this after reading critics in England that wet their pants over this recording. I can get on board with updating something (this is Podger's second recorded go-round at some of these concertos) and the newness of something. However, I do not understand critics who think this recording is any way superior to older period recordings like this one unless they believe the characteristics I cited above are somehow superior or better-sounding.The best part of this recording, by far, is the triple violin concerto that closes it. A remake of J.S. Bach's concerto for three harpsichords, the soloists and members of the band have more sprightly rhythms and generally invest this music with more energy and emotion than the earlier, more famous, pieces, especially the double and triple concertos which I have heard better played on this old LP and Antonio Janigro's recording with I Solisti de Zagreb and soloists Josip Klima, Ivan Pinkava, Andre Lardrot and Werner Tripp with Anton Heiller on the continuo.So, all told, an OK purchase but not an essential one for anyone's music library since the most popular concertos have been done better elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U0W8FLDBNOJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTESHXI#wasThisHelpful","R3U0W8FLDBNOJJ","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any audiophile that questions the validity (and value) of spending $40 or more for a Japanese-made SH-M compact disk only need sample Valery Gergiev's 1999 recording of Stravinsky's La Sacre du Printemps to judge for himself or herself. In my opinion, the value is great.SH-M CDs are made in Japan on a limited basis. They are constructed using plastic that does a better job of drawing out the sound than the typical redbook or even super audio CD. The sound on this CD is magnificent, more realistic and lifelike than any I've ever heard with depth that mimics the best sound you've ever heard in your home or car. There is simply nothing like a SH-M CD for magnificence in recorded sound.This wouldn't matter much if the performance wasn't top quality but it is. To paraphrase what a critic in an American journal recently said, Gergiev's forces managed to be raucous, unsophisticated and beautiful at the same time, quite a trick in this music.Le Sacre celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2013 having been premiered during a riot in Paris in 1913. Because of that, Decca released a Le Sacre du printemps 100th Anniversary Collector's Edition, a package of 20 disks and 38 different performances of the ballet.This package was revieved in the May-June issue of Fanfare magazine by two critics including the one I paraphrased above. Both critics said this recording, by Gergeiv, was the pick of the litter among those 38 renderings. One went so far as to say Gergiev's recording set a new performance standard for the music.High praise, indeed, but worthy, especially when you hear it on this SH-M CD. These expensive recordings aren't made for everyone, of course, just those willing to spend the money to acquire the best possible recording. There also aren't many recordings released on SH-M CD. The best one I'd known before this was Pollini's classic recording of Beethoven's five final piano sonatas which made the older DG sound come alive in ways I'd never previously known.Because of their expense it's best to sample SH-M CDs on classic recordings that are going to stand the test of time against competition to come in the future. This recording is one of those.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RERQ4CXRD4JD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016HCFTA#wasThisHelpful","RERQ4CXRD4JD6","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any fan of 18th century church or sacred music simply must have this enduring and magnificent collection of English language hymns from Franz Josef Haydn and his English friends, among them Charles Burney, Johan Arnold Bahmen and John Foster. Right from the first piece -- ""Dr. Harrington's Complaint"" AKA ""What art expresses"" -- this collection engages the mind and heart with counterpoint for three to five singers and/or choir in Haydn's typically melodiously, humanistic and engaged style.Every piece here is seemingly a simple little thing for a single or two or three or five soloists and/orchorus -- until you try to master it. I chose one of these hymns -- ""Maker of all! Be thou my guard"" -- for a Sunday church service. Set for two sopranos and bass, I (a tenor in church choir) chose the second soprano part with our best soprano and our best bass musician for the other parts. We are all accomplished singers that have participated in paraprofessional concertizing, quartets and are experienced church choir and choral society singers and this was a difficult trick taking on Haydn's deceptively simple hymn detailing God's help, glory and love.And so it is with the remainder; these tunes fall easy on the ear and the lyrics, always understandable without resorting to the texts included in the booklet, are always enunciated with excellence from the soloists and members of Psalmody, an English period choir. They are equally well-supported by the Parley of Instruments, five English soloists on violin, viola, cello and organ or fortepiano.Among my favorites are the first tune, ""What are expresses,"" the one I chose to perform in church, and John Stafford Smith's ""Horrible is the end of th' unrighteous generation,"" an 11-minute-plus tune that starts dour and goes all over the place after that -- a mini-cantata for five male singers (one a male alto), choir, string quartet and organ where each singer has recitative and is followed by another.

"Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt's Hamburg version of Brahms' Symphony No. 4 is, unlike his BBC concert version, steeped in the values of late Brahms with an autumnal glow over the whole thing that best characterizes the composer's late years. Brahms, a native of Hamburg, is exceptionally well-represented here, in my opinion. This is my favorite version of any recording of the Brahms Fourth Symphony and is the intellectual opposite of the much-praised and, in my opinion, highly overrated  Carlos Kleiber recording that makes Brahms late edifice into the ravings of a madman of sorts. Knowing so much about the composer's late life, his longings and his diffidence, I simply cannot accept this interpretation of late Brahms.Unfortunately this recording -- or its counterpart from the integral set of Brahms symphonies from Schmidt-Isserstedt -- is not available as a single recording anywhere but in Vox's deleted LP. For those of you that still spin LPs, this is a find in wonderful sound. The orchestra may be a tab homogenized in the recording and the sections of the orchestra don't stand out as they would in a London Phase 4 wreck. However, if you want to hear Brahms' resignation at the end of his life, here is one of the best ways to do so. Only Barbirolli's Vienna Philharmonic recording, sadly also out of print in USA, compares.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NASJF4SPD26M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KL3SLE#wasThisHelpful","R2NASJF4SPD26M","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those new to classical music, the late Canadian pianist Glenn Gould reconstituted J.S. Bach's art in the middle 20th century and turned its world upside down when he released the 1955 Goldberg variations. He did so by playing the music staccato without using any pedal then carried it forward in all Bach's keyboard works. While everyone in the period performance era now plays this way, it was new in 1955 and had never before been heard. The technique works better some places than others and works well in Bach because of the composer's mathematical perfrection in thes preludes and fugues where left-hand and right-hand voicing is so absolutely critical. Listen to the most approachable Prelude and Fugue in E flat No. 7 in the first book, tracks 13 and 14, to hear everything you need to know about this and about Gould -- including his famous humalong technique that has sent fans and critics on both sides of the Atlantic and a few other oceans atwitter for more than half a century now.Gould was one of the most interesting characters of the middle 20th century and was exploited by the recording industry more than just about any other virtuoso in the 1960s before he stopped recording and playing in public. He played a piano at his cottage on a lake near Toronto that sounded like a harpsichord and was the first major figure in classical music to try to make a modern piano sound like a harpsichord with no reverberant characteristics. This aided the clarity of his sound but also made it into a hybrid of modern pianism without beauty. To suggest Bach wanted his music played t this way is questionable although Bach never considered the 48 suitable to be played the way they are now -- with whole sets performed in concert and often recorded. Bach wrote them to promote his idea of equal temperament (the use of key structure we now follow unquestionably) and then his students and others played them for practice and to memorize equal temperament.Gould, being the ultiimate cult figure in his time and ours, is enough for Sony to continue rereleasing these works to new audiences. The sound hasn't been improved here so don't bother if you have one of the older sets. Gould wil always be unique for his approach. As to ideas one reviewere wrote that his ""digital technique in its relationship to the keyboard was of astonishing,"" this is now commonplace among recent graduates of musical conservatories. Gould is no longer unique in this respect with the thousands of new pianists copying him every day with even more perfect forms of prestidigitization at the keyboard. But, as anyone that always hated Gould's apprach inately knows, there is more than one way to play the piano; just ask (or listen to) Andras Schiff's well-tempered klavier -- or any other pianist that believes in using the sostenuto pedal with some romantic character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PP8NMG5EFZ2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085MK2GM#wasThisHelpful","R2PP8NMG5EFZ2Y","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...and I'm the fool as I was for buying this collection of bland Mendelssohn symphonies. My first exposure to Emmanuel Krivine and his period band was in their Beethoven: symphony box that got some buzz in classical music circles for somehow being different from the norm. Influenced by the buzz, I bit and found nothing out of the ordinary in their Beethoven, yet I went back for a second drink with this recording.I'm a sucker for the Mendelssohn ""Reformation"" symphony, his final exposition in that genre, and have owned and/or heard just about every recording of it ever made. I was pleased when my local orchestra performed it in concert a few years back. Had this recording been of my local orchestra's performance, I would likely have been more satisfied.I heard the end of this Reformation on my PBS radio channel in the car one day and was impressed by the clarity of the instrumentation and depth of the playback less than the way Krivine built the dramatic finale. What a disappointment it was to hear the whole thing! First, it includes a none-too-individual-nor-spectacular recording of Mendelssohn's warhorse Italian symphony. To me, that's the kind of music that gives Mendelssohn a reputation as a lightweight in classical music. While full of memorable tunes, it is like that river in Nebraska that's a mile wide and an inch deep. I enjoyed it the first 10 times I heard it as a new classical music collector in 1972 and have been bored with it since.So shame on me for buying it again. Sadly, that's the only way I could acquire the CD (no thanks to the download) of the Reformation. That was a disappointment too. While the period band's instruments do stand out and, with that, bring the lines of counterpoint into the open, there was nothing about Krivine's leadership in any way impressive. It was a read-through performance with little or no nuance that one might hear in practice. What I heard on the radio was pumped up by the filters my local FM station uses, making their sound larger than it really is. When played at my house, the thin sound of Krivine's period orchestra was exposed. I should have known that after my experience with their Beethoven but, as they say, memory is among the first things to go as one ages. Shame on me again.Fortunately, there are many better alternatives for anyone seekng a reading of the Reformation symphony with more guts and insight than this one. My favorite among all the recordings I've heard is from Mendelssohn expert Claus Peter Flor whose recording of Mendelssohn's Symphonies 1 & 5 is out of print but still available used for little expense from Amazon vendors. Flor understands Mendelssohn better than any conductor I know that has recorded much of the composer's work. He is a master of pacing, never overplays the music, yet consistently finds the dramatic threads hidden within Mendelssohn's gloss but never puts it in your face like some other conductors I know (see below.)The one notable downside to this recording is RCA's tubby and congested recording that disallows the Bamberg Symphony from being all it could be sonically. The recording is slightly improved on the later release of Mendelssohn's symphonies, concertos and overtures under Flor, which is definitely the best buy for anyone seeking an inclusive box of all Mendelssohn's symphonies.Another great Reformation symphony comes from the legendary conductor Arturo Toscanini. Conducted slower than the norm these days, this was one of the maestro's best transfers in the Toscanini Collection even though the mono sound, while quite good, is yesterday's sound. For those seeking a stand alone recording of the Reformation symphony with more detailed and open sound, I would recommend the interpretation from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under Max Rudolf that was once available on a Decca LP but was never to my knowledge introduced by Decca on CD or download. You can, however, buy it in both CD and download format from two aftermarket companies -- Hadyn House and Klassic Haus Restorations -- that make recordings from pristine originals. Both have remade Rudolf's Reformation symphony from reel-to-reel tape originals.Both companies link it with Franz Berwald's Symphony in C ""Singuliere"" that was its original Decca LP mate. While I don't find Berwald an ideal mate for Mendelssohn, it is to me a better match than hearing the Italian symphony again and it's a better work than Mendelssohn's first symphony on Flor's recording. For the unititiated, the Romantic era but more modern-sounding Berwald is far more than makeweight and is equally well done by Rudolf and Cincinnati whose projection and power suit the music perfectly.Of the two recordings I like the Klassic Haus version best for a couple reasons. First, it sounds better. I think Klassic Haus uses a better filtering and recording system than Haydn House, whose recordings made from LPs often sound more distant and with compressed dynamic ranges compared to the originals. Klassic Haus retained the original gimmicky Decca source with violins in the left channel and lower strings in the right. Klassic Haus makes it available in a 320kbps download for $5 or CD with the original LP cover for $12 while Haydn House only offers a $12 CD with its own paraprofessional artwork.Because of my inclinations toward the Italian symphony I don't have a range of recommendations but will note one. Aside from his recordings of Beethoven, Wagner and Richard Strauss, I am almost always disillusioned when I hear Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. I waited years to buy their box of Mendelssohn symphonies and, after hearing it, was glad I didn't spend much money on it.However, Maestro Karajan's version of the Italian symphony astonished me. After hearing him butcher the other symphonies with ceaseless pounding timpani and other inapproriate Germanic characterisitics, his lightness of touch and spontaneity in the Italian symphony made it an unexpected delight. Perhaps this because it was the rose between four thorns but, for whatever reason, I can recommend Karajan's Italian to anyone seeking a recording of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHJNXWT8N55R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H0MH40#wasThisHelpful","R3SHJNXWT8N55R","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bicycyle, swim, hike and otherwise spend lots of time outdoors all year, especially in the fair weather seasons, and look for long-lasting sunscreen that will deter skin cancer in my prolonged exposure. I tried Banana Boat's Sport performance coolzone formula SPF 30 as part of Amazon's Vine program; while some say there is nothing stronger than SPF 30, I'd have tried SPF 50 if I was buying the stuff -- which I may do after this trial.Banana Boat says this formula works for swim, splash and sport, is non-greasy and fast absorbing. My experience with this after a couple weeks' use mostly as a sun deterrent while riding my road bike contradicts at least one of these claims: I consistently felt greasy after using it though I never incurred a burn or rash.Typically I use Coppertone Sport Lotion SPF 50 Sunscreen & Antioxidants-8 oz for my daily regimen. Compared to it, the Banana Boat sunscreen goes on about the same, I use about the same amount for coverage on my head, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, legs and feet, and it leaves me feeling more encumbered after my outdoor day is over. Generally speaking, Coppertone Sport stays light on my skin long after my day in the sun is over. This was not my experience with a single application of this product. On a couple occasions I put it on twice and there was little difference then.Part of the reason for this, I imagine, is detailed on the Banana Boat bottle which says ""Non-Greasy Fast Absorbing Water Resistance (80 Minutes)."" The directions say to put it on 15 minutes before sun exposure and to reapply 80 minutes after swimming or sweating. Translation: it gets washed off when you sweat. For me, 80 minutes is about the typical duration of one of my outdoor bike rides so extra layers are not usually necessary. Depending on your habits, this may be an issue.A more telling element may be the composition of the product. For comparative purposes, Coppertone Sports has more ingredients than Banana Boat to wit:Coppertone SportAvobenzone 3%Homosalate 13%Octisalate 5%Octocrylene 5%Oxybenzone 6%...SunscreenBanana Boat SportAvobenzone 2.5%Homlsalate 5%Octocrylene 4%...SunscreenMy unscientific reading of this says there is more active ingredients in Coppertone and more sunscreen too. One final note: I have found this sunscreen better after summer is over during the autumn. It isn't as heavy but still does the job for the milder sun in late September and October, when I'm still active biking daily.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK7OOFJGGSIH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FKNGIO#wasThisHelpful","RK7OOFJGGSIH4","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Sinister"" is a little horror film that made the rounds of small theaters coincidental with its video release. I saw it yesterday in a mall theater in Grand Rapids, Mich. It's the story of an author (Ethan Hawke) who writes about grizzly murders for a living, moving himself and his family (wife plus two kids) to the whereabouts of the killings for his book research. In this film, his family has moved to the home where the murdered family lived and where the deeds occurred. And, this time, the intrepid journalist gets a lot more than he bargained for, receiving clues about the murders no one else knows from who knows where.The production involves many typical horror film tricks -- loud noises and things that go bump in the night, ghostly visions of what may or may not be people, townspeople at odds with the principal characters because they are revisiting the murders that rocked their neighborhood, machines that turn themselves on after everyone goes to bed, the usual malcontented children, one of whom can't sleep through the night without going into something like night shock. And on and on. All the odd noises and strange goings-on happen in the dark, of course.But a few clever plot contrivances, a marginally serpentine story that will keep you vested, and some originality save this little film from being just another exercise in horror film ho-hum. I can't tell you the best part because it would spoil the end and disclose the denouement. However, I can tell you that neither my wife nor I -- who are 65 and 62 years old, respectively, and veterans of hundreds of horror films in the theater and at home -- could guess how the film would be resolved and what would happen at the end. If neither of us can guess how a movie is going to end -- and you get a few clues in the last half-hour of ""Sinister"" -- then it is in my book an effective movie.Be forewarned, the opening scene of ""Sinister"" is fairly grizzly in itself. Having seen the opening, I was fearful the movie would venture into X-rated territory but it did not. It is R-rated for intensity, adult content, scenes of murder, language and blood but the movie does not particularly manifest anything the average horror film maven would consider bad taste in 2012. See this in the small theater, like we did, or on your 55-inch TV and prepare yourself for a good horror story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2824HNSHXCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJLHUA8#wasThisHelpful","R2D2824HNSHXCP","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since ganster films took over for cowboys and Indians as American mens' chiefs fantasy genre, there frankly haven't been a lot of good mob movies. For every Goodfellas there are a dozen Knockaround Guys, movies that try to get mens blood boiling but instead fall into the pile of forgettable, milquetoast movies. Here's one that transcends the arc and is high-paced, powerful, memorable and well-acted with an anti-hero lead you can root for.""Kill The Irishman"" is a fact-based story about Cleveland roughneck, union leader and mobster Danny Greene, played well by real-life lookalike Ray Stevenson, and the turf war he ignited with the Cleveland and New York Italian mafia over a loan gone bad. This movie has just about everything any man wants in a male fantasy: lots of tough talk, explosions, mayhem, killing, overflowing glands and even a sex scene with a beautiful dame. I found this movie an oasis in the ocean of bad mobster movies I am daily presented with on my 250-channel dish offering.The flick include newsreels from the 1970s, the era when the greatest action took place, that verify what really happened and even splices a piece of film showing the real Danny Green so you can tell Stevenson really was his look-alike. It features graduates of movie and TV mobsterdom including actors from Sopranos, The Seven-Ups, The French Connection and the aforementioned Goodfellas.

"Starting with The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music 2010 critics have piled on this 1751 version of Handel's Messiah saying Rene Jacobs' conducting is mannered, the solo singing is nondescript, and the conductor's penchant to add a lute continuo and some other affectations takes much away from the music, instead focusing on performance style. While I agree there is a certain individulity about this performance, this is the twentieth version of Handel's Messiah I have owned and nothing Jacobs does here strikes me as particularly mannered, certainly not in comparison to what Beecham did in his famous 1959 recording that added kettledrums, brass and lots of other noise. And it has far more fire, religious affect and personality than more straightforward accounts such as Marriner and Colin Davis.Since there are several editions of Messiah available, this one may not be to everyone's liking. It's my preferred version mostly because of the addition of the chorus ""Let all the angels of God worship him"" early in part 2. I generally prefer to hear the tenor section prevalent in the final moments -- that's not the case here -- but this is a good enough rendering from Jacobs and his group. Otherwise, I find this version more satisfactory than some other period versions I know including those from Pinnock, whose first and second parts are not equally fine, Higginbottom with trebles in the female roles and some stodgy rhythms, Hogwood's variably excellent and vanilla version, Williams Christie's recording very similar to this one, and McCreesh whose theatricality sometimes seems out of place in the music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIMIRAJ0NBOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GUJYKQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RIMIRAJ0NBOT","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is among Herbert von Karajan's final recordings and it comes back here in a single disk edition for people that still buy compact disks. The recording itself is a little more immediate than earlier versions.Musically, this is in league with a couple other two disk versions of the Nowak and Haas scores from the same period -- Carlo Maria Giulini's recording from Vienna and Gunther Wand's Lubeck cathedral recording. All three have solid reverential and Brucknerian qualities and, while Wand's has the edge being recorded in concert in the cathedral with its smashing reverberant sonics, there's not a lot else that differentiates the three unless you count against Giulini his tendency to focus on minutiae.I generally consider Karajan overrated as a Bruckner interpreter and think his integral set of the symphonies, while sometimes mighty and Germanic, often unimaginative and regularly showing the bar line. This version of the monolithic Symphony 8 has stood out for years and, now that it's finally available on a single disk, it's a better buy. His fans are happy to have it back; perhaps others can be too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGK35LG0YQIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PC1GF8#wasThisHelpful","R1MGK35LG0YQIT","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put one of these on my 2011 Chevy Cruze with its 1 1/4 inch hitch after my old trunk bike rack scratched paint on the lid. The trunk rack never fit property, probably because the Cruze has such a short deck. This rack eschews that problem becuase it fits into the trailer hitch. Be advised this rack only fits 1 1/4 inch hitches and won't work on a 2 inch hitch. And, if you don't already have a hitch on your car, you have to get one of those first. The one I bought cost $220 installed. You could conceivably do that yourself on a Cruze since the place I went to didn't weld it and was finished in 15 minutes.But we're talking about the bike rack here whose manufacturing is outstanding with excellent fit and finish. The thing is super heavy duty, weighing in at around 45 pounds, but it's easy to fit it into the rack. The bikes sit in fitted cradles with no metallic finish to scratch them. They are held on the rack by heavy velcro straps; I suppose these could wear out over time though they work great for me now.The steel is substantial and putting the rack together out of the box is easy; there are only three parts, six nuts and bolts, and a bolt to deal with. It fits fine in the hitch and has a little sway but nothing to worry about unless you are carrying a gorilla back there. I see no way it could ever make contact with the vehicle short of driving in a hurricane or tornado.One feature that drew me to this model, aside from the substance of construction, ease of use, the fact it fit my Cruze's hitch, and that great reflector on the back, was the offset shank that allows the bottom of the rack to ride a few inches higher than the point at which it contacts the hitch. The Chevy Cruze rides exceedingly low anyway so the hitch is low. This was a major consideration in my decision to buy this product, as was Amazon's free shipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1IIOB44GIT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R388JG#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1IIOB44GIT9","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not diabetic and don't have the foggiest notion what these socks do for diabetics. I've bought diabetic socks before and none were as good as these. These all-cotton (about 1 percent nylon for the stretch) socks fit my need which was, regrettably, vanity based. My wife always complained when I rode my bike riding crew socks because the things are constructed so tightly they stay up. I guess she thought I looked nerdy with socks touching my calves.I looked in stores and around the Web for all-cotton socks that would naturally droop a bit to a lot and guess what? They apparently don't exist. These are the closest I could find to the 100 percent cotton crew-style socks I wore in high school during the 1960s that would never stay up and crumpled into a pile on my ankles. These don't do that although they will -- comfortably -- if you want them to. They stay up fairly well and even retain some rise after an hour pumping my 21-speed through country roads 18-20 MPH.The other part of these great socks, and what I did not expect, is they are very warm and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, these are probably the most comfortable socks I've ever known. The slight but significant comfort bottom helps my feet feel better than in famous label socks that cost $25 a pair. At $15 a pair these are a bit pricey for crew socks but, in my opinion, they are worth it.I've bought four pairs of these and put two through several wash and dry cycles. The quality control has been consistent in sizing, fabric quality and fit and they haven't shrunk, yellowed, faded or debased in any way. These socks are a winner for anyone wanting to eschew all the manmade products in typical crew socks. They probably do well for diabetics, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRFH04GRUHYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W4D8MW#wasThisHelpful","R2FRFH04GRUHYU","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made from concert recordings in England during 2011 and 2012, this is Paul McCreesh's realization of Mendelssohn's original performance of Felix Mendelssohn's (1809-47) oratorio Elijah from 1846. McCreesh, a period music practitioner who used an extra-dramatic approach in his recordings of Haydn's Creation and Mozart's Great Mass in C minor to somewhat split effect, seems willing to take a more reverential, perhaps religious, approach to Mendelssohn's drama about the prophet Elijah with speeds generally slower than the norm for our era and singers using a lot more vibrato than the norm today.He is supported by Englishman Simon Keenlyside in the principal role and mezzo-soprano Sarah Connelly who joined him in the Mozart. Other soloists are soprano Rosemary Joshua, tenor Robert Murray and treble Jonty Ward whose contributions are greatest in the closing pages of the first half before the Lord laveth the thirsty land. Several choirs joined the Wroclaw (Poland) Philharmonic Choir and McCreesh's Gabrieli Consort & Players to make this ginormous recording.In recent years, coming under influence of the period performance practice movement, most new recordings of Elijah have used choruses of 40 or less including the performance led by Paul Daniel that starred Bryn Terfel in the leading role. This and similar recordings allowed the choir to enunciate all the words in the text so the audience could understand most of what they were saying without resorting to printed guides.That didn't happen here with about 350 singers in the choir. Some of the choruses start out sounding legible but most are a mass of sometimes undecipherable sound. McCreesh has never struck me as the kind of guy to keep the British choral tradition of massive sound going strong but that's what happened here. As to individual singers, I found tenor Murray to be the pick of the litter in this group. He is always eloquent, impassioned and reigns in rubato and vibrato for the most part. Aside from going flat in the opening (""As God the Lord of Isreal liveth...""), I've heard Keenlyside overplay his hand before and he does so here, misplacing English gusto for Biblical blasting. Connelly is typically lovely but the womens parts are small and they use too much vibrato as if they were singing opera.While the British press wet its pants over this recording, even some of them had to admit its warts. One reported, ""The orchestral playing, though full of fiery drama, occasionally left quite a lot to be desired: horribly spliced brass entries were a particularly (period performance) highlight and there were all the usual tuning difficulties, especially in the woodwinds."" Another debit: ""In a performance so consciously in line with a big, grand tradition of English choral singing it was no surprise to hear Elgar in there too,"" meaning the enterprise sounded Elgarian as well as, or perhaps instead of, Mendelssohnian -- romantically heavy and pompous instead of classically lithe and dramatic.I think anyone that listens critically to this against other renderings will find this a good recording if you want a massive sound and chorus or if you want to pretend you were part of the occasion of the recording, which must certainly have been splendid. But, for listening repeatedly at home, this one doesn't topple my list of favorites that include Daniel, Burgos' classic version and Spering's German language period version that rivals this one with a smaller chorus and more focused and condensed choral sound. To me, this is neither as dramatic as McCreesh's other recordings and similarly lacks religious conviction to his recording of Bach's Magnificat and Easter Oratorio.A note for the packaging.

"Ricreazioni is Italian for entertainment and that's about what you get in this concept album devoted to music of Italian composers from the Baroque, Classic and Romantic periods reinvented by 20th century Italians. The contents are:-- Gian Franceso Malipiero's (1882-1973) Vivaldiana, a three-movement (about 16 minues) parody/simile on any ubiquitous concerto from Antonio Vivaldi with 20th century ideas and orchestration woven throughout. Malipiero is generally credited with popularizing Vivaldi's music -- which sat unplayed after his death like J.S. Bach's before Mendelssohn unearthed it -- during the 20th century.-- Luigi Dallapiiccola's (1904-75) Tartiniana, a divertimento for violin and orchestra in five sections (about 15 and one-half minutes) built around themes from Giuseppe Tartini, who wrote hundreds of violin concertos and sonatas in the 1700s. Dallapiiccola was a serial composer greatly influenced by Wagner, Debussy and the Second Viennese School. He wrote Tartiniana mid-career in 1951.-- Alfredo Casella's (1883-1947) Paganiniana, a divertimento for orchestra on themes of Niccol Paganini in four movements (about 19 minutes), fairly transcends music from the named composer. Casella, best known for a number of Mahleresque symphonies, composed this suite that includes a loud allegro agitato first movement, a polka in allegro, a romance and a tarantella that offer moods greater than most will know from Paganini.-- Ottorino Resphigi's (1879-1936) four part suite (about 25:30 here) on themes of Gioachino Rossini known as Rossiniana, a favorite of conductor Ernest Ansermet with some of the appeal of the Respighi-Rossini collaboration La Boutique Fantasque (the fantastic toyshop.) This is the most famous and oft-recorded item on the concert with about four dozen recordings in Amazon's archive for either orchestra or guitar.I bought this for Rossiniana mated to something different than normal and like the collection, especially Casella's romance in Paganiniana and Respighi's tarantella from Rossiniana that's much better than the tarantella in Paganiniana. Italian conductor Aldo Ceccato leads the Malaga (Spain) Philharmonic Orchestra with lively, attentive musicmaking that isn't always Italianate. Josef Horvath is listed on the credits; he must have been the producer for he has no profile as a classical musician that I can locate.Ricreazioni befits its description as entertainment but comprises fairly innocuous and unimportant music that occasionally lacks the bounce of Vivaldi, the zest of Paganini, or the color of Respighi and is only available via download with no information about the reasoning behind this collection, its recording date(s), the label, conductor, orchestra or Joseph Horvath. It's probably best suited to those that enjoy any of the mimicked composers without demanding one of their masterpieces be on the menu.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187L0J23D4S4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JNIE92#wasThisHelpful","R187L0J23D4S4O","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the two-CD version of this performance (not the MP3 download) that's available through Amazon Sept. 25. I can't tell if the sound is better on the CD since I didn't listen to the download.Otherwise, this is Paul McCreesh's realization of Mendelssohn's original performance of Elijah from 1846 taken from a series of concerts given during August and September 2011 in London's Proms concerts in cavernous Royal Albert Hall. The latter fact makes this somewhat eccentric sounding since the hemispherical hall is notoriously difficult to record in, especially when you have hundreds of singers hanging around like this one does.McCreesh, a period music practitioner who used an extra-dramatic approach in his recordings of  Haydn's Creation and Mozart's ""Great"" Mass in C minor to somewhat split effect, seems willing to take a more reverential, perhaps religious, approach to Mendelssohn's drama about the prophet Elijah. He is supported by Englishman Simon Keenlyside in the principal role and mezzo-soprano Sarah Connelly who joined him in the Mozart. Other soloists are soprano Rosemary Joshua, tenor Robert Murray and treble Jonty Ward whose contributions are greatest in the closing pages of the drama before Elijah broke forth like a fire and the morning light breaking through ends the story. Several choirs joined the Wroclaw (Poland) Philharmonic Choir and McCreesh's Gabrieli Consort & Players to make this ginormous recording.In recent years, coming under influence of the period performance practice movement, most new recordings of Elijah have used choruses of 40 or less including the performance led by Paul Daniel that starred Bryn Terfel in the leading role. This and similar recordings allowed the choir to enunciate all the words in the text so the audience could understand most of what they were saying without resorting to printed guides.That didn't happen here with about 350 singers in the choir. Some of the choruses start out sounding legible but most are simply a mass of sound. McCreesh has never struck me as the kind of guy to keep the British choral tradition of massive sound going strong but that's what happened here. As to individual singers, I found tenor Murray to be the pick of the litter in this group. He is always eloquent, impassioned and reigns in rubato and vibrato, for the most part. Keenlyside tends  to overplay his hand in many roles and does so here, misplacing English gusto for Biblical blasting. Connelly is typically lovely but the womens parts are small.While the British press wet its pants over this recording, even some of them had to admit its warts. One reported, ""The orchestral playing, though full of fiery drama, occasionally left quite a lot to be desired: horribly spliced brass entries were a particularly (period performance) highlight and there were all the usual tuning difficulties, especially in the woodwinds."" Another debit: ""In a performance so consciously in line with a big, grand tradition of English choral singing it was no surprise to hear Elgar in there too,"" meaning the enterprise sounded Elgarian as well as Mendelssohnian.I think anyone that listens critically to this against other renderings will find this a good recording if you want a massive sound and chorus or if you want to pretend you were part of the occasion of the recording, which must certainly have been a splendid venue. But, for listening repeatedly at home, this one doesn't topple my list of favorites that include Daniel, Burgos' classic version and Spering's period version that rivals this one with a smaller chorus and more focused and condensed choral sound. To me, this is neither as dramatic as McCreesh's other recordings and similarly lacks religious conviction to his recording of Bach's Magnificat and Easter Oratorio.One notable advantage of this CD version is the packaging. The CDs come inside a 41-page book with the vocal score reproduced in English and Polish, lots of bios on all the performers, essays and other material about the music, its history and this performance. The one downside is the CD slides into rather tight folders on the front and back cover and will probably be scratched over time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DL9ROA3ETZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X4WT86#wasThisHelpful","R13DL9ROA3ETZM","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I listen to Arpad Joo and the Budapest Symphony Orchestra play the symphonic poems of Franz Liszt (1811-86), I think their renditions are the best. Yet, when I listen to the same music from Kurt Masur and his better orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, I think theirs the best. The only way I resolve this conundrum is to keep and listen to both sets repeatedly.Thankfully, Bernard Haitink's set with the even better London Philharmonic Orchestra is a non-starter in this argument, given that the conductor is so temperamentally at odds with Liszt's excesses and all-out requirements. Had the youthful Zubin Mehta recorded all Liszt's symphonic poems when he was in Los Angeles -- as he did with three of them on this exquisite recording -- he'd have probably been the winner of this sweepstakes. But, alas, he did not and Lisztophiles have Joo and Masur to save the day.If you've not exposed yourself to Liszt's symphonic poem canon beyond barnburners like Les Preludes, Mazeppa and the few others higher profile conductors dabble with, his poems may take some time getting to know. They are divided into two camps: those of philosphic origin such as The Ideal, What One Hears On the Mountain and From the Cradle to the Grave, where the composer sets out to discuss ideas about life, death and everything in between; and those of national origin such as Hungaria and Battle of the Huns, the latter probably be the best and most exciting of all Liszt's symphonic poems even though it suffers from his tendency to repeat themes and involve banal effects.Music lovers whose nature is reflected in the intricacies, subtlety and delicacy of Mozart or Chopin probably think the adjective banal best describes Liszt's symphonic music. I disagree though I admit it exists in his longer, less compact pieces. There are bountiful glories for the intrepid lsitener as Liszt perfected the symphonic poem and cast the matrix for nationalist and international composers that followed -- Smetana, Dvorak, Richard Strauss and Tchaikovsky. Whether any of those giants would have gone on to compose magnificent orchestral tone poems without Liszt's leadership is a question for the ages.In comparison to Masur's collection with the Leipzig orchestra that focuses on faster speeds, more excitement and razor-sharp orchestral execution, Joo's complement of Liszt exploits the composer's orchestration, his poetry, the 360 degree span of his disposition, and the relative orchestral balance inside the music, an area Liszt is rarely considered expert. Yet Joo picks up on this and translates it in every poem, never more tellingly than in the quiet second subject of What One Hears On the Mountain. He makes Festlange -- which can be banal trash under lesser hands -- into a monolith of texture after the opening exposition and before the recapitualation.Even discussing concepts like exposition and recap in Liszt's symphonic poems is dangerous. The composer sought to extend those ideas far beyond anything that had been known up to his day. Instead of the taut translation of ideas in strict sonata form one hears in Brahms' Academic Festival Overture, Liszt allows his music free reign to run all over the place in secondary, tertiary and primary ideas, often foisted from the point of recap or even the literary equivalent of denouement. As Wikipedia wrote about this part of Liszt's genre:""As purely musical structures, the symphonic poems do not follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifs--recurring melodies associated with a subject--are thematically transformed in a manner similar to that later made famous by Richard Wagner.""Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened  while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.""In this way, Liszt not only foretold the coming works of others in the genre, he influenced the likes of his son-in-law Richard Wagner and his acolyte Anton Bruckner -- with the constantly repeating thematic material -- and even the 20th century modernist Gyrgy Ligeti, whose Lux Aeterna begins on rising themes found in Bruckner's E minor mass and, earlier, in some of Liszt's sacred choral music.Joo and the Budapest Orchestra are with him every step of the way in all 13 poems and selected other works from his pen. While the big moments shine as brightly here as anywhere, those with greater repose and/or poetry seem to speak even more loudly in terms of their message in the greater context of the poem. This box comes with a description of every piece that will give the uninitiated a good starting point if they are new to these works. In good modern digital sound, this is a collection to begin and end your search for understanding of Franz Liszt's visionary tone poems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38C8ZJD9V444G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000087N2D#wasThisHelpful","R38C8ZJD9V444G","A2T049UQONS0OY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T049UQONS0OY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"GREAT pillow, IF you want a solid latex rubber foam pillow and understand how it differs from all other pillows.  BUT, I returned it to Amazon.com because the same pillow is $23.91 CHEAPER on Walmart.com!  That is a HUGE difference!  Other reviewers explained about this type of pillow very well, but I would like to add my comments.  Most pillows are either fiber fill of some sort, intended to simulate the down pillows of old that are now extremely expensive.  You ""fluff"" them, put you head on them and your head sinks in with the pillow flattening.  Newer pillows use ""memory foam,"" which - in MY opinion - is very uncomfortable in ANY bedding use (e.g. mattresses).  Memory foam is sort of supportive, BUT - at the same time, it is mushy.  Memory foam conforms to the shape of the weight on it; like your head.  Memory foam, by its nature, resists movement of what is on it; i.e. movement of your head.  IF you are like me and move around at night, memory foam is not comfortable in addition to being overly warm regardless of infusion with ""gel"" technology.  Solid natural rubber latex foam, and - to a large extent - shredded foam pillows, support your head but allow for movement.  Many years ago, solid natural rubber latex pillows came in a variety of densities or ""firmnesses.""  I do not see that variety today.  THIS pillow is nearly identical to my old Beautyrest solid natural rubber latex foam pillow but is slightly smaller and considerably less dense.  Some reviewers complained that the pillow felt to them like ""sleeping on a brick.""  While likely a gross exaggeration, these pillows are vastly different in feel than anything else.  The current model is quite soft and pliable.READERS NOTE: these pillows are made from natural rubber latex.  I did NOT see any health warning in the ad or on the packaging, but there probably should be.  People who are allergic to natural rubber latex should probably avoid these pillows!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM00HRVHX1SJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BI22UW#wasThisHelpful","RM00HRVHX1SJ2","A2730CR657291E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2730CR657291E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rated this lens as 3 stars, ""It's OK"" only because it is probably suitable for people wanting ""record shots"" that will never be enlarged or examined critically.  This lens is NOT suitable for anyone who truly pursues photography as more than simple record keeping.  I was seeking a lightweight and moderately priced single lens alternative to the Canon 18-55 and 55-250mm kit lenses.  I was assured by the vendor from whom I bought this lens that it is ""much better optically"" than the Canon kit lenses.  Upon receipt, I took this lens out with my 55-250mm kit lens and shot identical photos, under identical conditions, seconds to minutes apart with both lenses.  There is a VERY significant difference in sharpness between the two lens, notably at the 200mm focal length.

"I have no idea how the image was taken for the advertisement!  The screen on the phone that I received was NO WHERE as sharp and clear.  It was difficult to impossible to see in normal room light, in the middle of a sunny day.  Admittedly, my den is not extremely bright, but it is ridiculous to need to turn on a room light or use a flash light to see the screen on the phone.  IN SHORT - the photo in the ad is VERY misleading.  When I tried increasing the contrast on the screen, all that happened was that the ""hidden"" ""unused"" numerals and characters became visible, INSTEAD of increasing the visibility of what I wanted and needed to see.  Please see attached photos.  I must admit to NOT having read reviews before buying this phone.  Before I find a replacement, I will do research.  The need for batteries/absence of an AC adapter is surprising and disappointing although not a fatal flaw by itself.  Whatever I do buy to replace this phone will have a well lit screen and an AC adapter.On the positive side - this phone offers perhaps the best call log facility I have ever seen in a telephone.  Unlike other phones that I have, the call log was very easy to access and provided very clear and concise information.  Apparently, the phone is well engineered for the hearing impaired (as I am).  The few calls I had on this phone were clear and easy to understand.  However, I did notice that the phone amplified the room air conditioner I have in my den.  NOTE: I did NOT try the ""audio assist"" feature.

"I was somewhat familiar with this group before I listened to this entire album on an American Airlines transatlantic flight.  It BLEW ME AWAY!  Musically, the harmonies and instrumental arrangements were nothing short of wonderful.  While I loved, and purchased the CD through Amazon.com upon returning home, one track, in particular really does something for me and to me.  The song ""Hallelujah, written by Leonard Cohen, is one of those enigmatic songs that is far beyond my comprehension.  BUT, there is something to the Gestalt of the piece, the rhythm, timing, something indefinable that reaches deep into my soul.  Perhaps because the first time I ever heard it was on an episode of the Scrubs TV series.  The song was played upon the passage of a beloved nurse character.

"I have been searching for a lighter camera for travel purposes to replace my beloved Canon T3i + Sigma 18-250mm lens (combined weight of around 39 ounces).  Before purchasing this SONY model through the awesome Amazon.com, I tried and rejected a Panasonic G5 (rejected for poor image quality), an Olympus OM-D E-M10 (rejected for poor ergonomic design - it actually made the fleshy part of my thumb sore) and a SONY a6000 (poor ergonomic design - simply not comfortable in my right hand.  EATS batteries!).  Since I was unable to find an a3000 locally to hold, I took a big chance ordering it blindly from Amazon.  HOWEVER, since Amazon is very responsible and responsive to customer needs - especially with respect to returns, I bought without worry about being stuck with something I did not like.What I love about this camera -The ergonomics - The body shape and hand grip are both well designed and perfect for my right hand.  While not the lightest possible lens/body combination available (the Olympus appears to be), it is about 12 ounces lighter than what I now have AND offers a longer zoom range than the Olympus.The images - I have tried both the 18-55 and optional 55-210 lenses.  Because of my shooting style and interests, I am likely to rarely use the shorter lens.  However, both performed very well on this body; especially for inexpensive ""kit"" lenses.  Neither focused very quickly, but fast enough to catch wild life photos.  I found almost no ""shutter lag,"" a critical issue for me when buying a camera.  Most of my early test shots were done in fully idiot-proof mode.  I believe the ISO was automatically set to 100 (I have since over-ridden this and changed the setting to ISO 400, at the moment, for smaller apertures and faster shutter speeds, with no apparent image degradation).Features - At least THIS SONY model offers ""manual focus assist,"" which I find to be a WONDERFUL tool.  Holding the shutter button halfway down, you let the camera autofocus.  THEN, you can fine tune the plane of sharpest focus to your liking with the manual focus ring.  When you do so, if you have this feature turned on in the menu*, the camera will magnify a small area of your whole image.  I find this to be an enormous help IF I have the time to manually adjust the focus.  Obviously, not very suitable for birds and critters that won't sit still for long!  I do have a small complaint about this feature, but it may be my lack of understanding about how it works.  I do not understand how the camera chooses which section of the whole image to magnify.  It is NOT. necessarily, the center of the screen!The camera has a built in panorama facility.  Turn the one setting dial (ONE dial, not 2, 3 or more like some modern cameras) to Panorama mode.  Aim the camera facing the left most portion of the scene you want included.  Press the shutter button and keep it depressed while panning across the desired image area.  Voila!  A perfect panoramic image produced IN the camera.  No need to use Photoshop to ""stitch"" together sections of a panoramic image!Very intuitive settings.  While I have glanced through the THREE manuals available in .pdf format on the SONY website, the last thing I want to do is sit and read them.  I was easily able to choose various menu settings to configure the camera to my liking without lengthy research.*Menu system - There are two menus; one for camera settings and one for photographic preferences.  BOTH are easily accessed with the push of a single button on the back of the body.  You can either view them in the eye level finder or on the larger view screen.  As you go from one item to the next and each choice within an item, a brief explanation appears.  NOTE: the explanation is in excellent English and makes sense!  Once you are familiar with the settings, you can turn off the explanations if you wish.What I hate about this camera -I bought this camera having read MANY reviews and also after having bought and returned an a6000.  I was well aware of battery life issues and bought anyway.  I have used the camera 3 times, so far, to make sure I want to keep it.  Each time was for about 1 hour and each use was for roughly 25 still photos without flash, 3 videos scattered over the 3 days, and 2 panoramic shots.  After this one hour use, the battery was down by 20-30%.  This is beyond pathetic!  It is SHAMEFUL for a company like SONY.I never had battery life issues with my early SONY a100 or with my Canon T3i.  I was able to shoot with both of those cameras ALL day and never once had to change batteries mid-day.BTW, SONY saved $5 or so per camera by NOT including an external battery charger. As noted by other reviewers, until and unless you buy an external charger you must charge the battery IN the camera.  The camera is NOT usable while charging the battery.  Charging can take up to ""290 minutes"" = 5 HOURS!!!!I am hoping that SONY cares enough about their customers to redesign/re-engineer their batteries to remedy this problem despite the fact that people, like me, are BUYING their cameras even knowing about the horrible battery life.  NOTE: 47th Street Photo, and likely others, sell compatible batteries with power capacity approximately DOUBLE that of the OEM battery!As of today, 7/8/2015, I know that SONY has at least one employee named Mitch assigned to reading and responding to customer reviews.  I am hoping that Mitch, or someone else from SONY, can respond with word of a better battery for this and other cameras using the NP-FW50 battery.Finally, other reviewers have commented on the low resolution eye level finder.  Their complaints are valid.  Resolution is inadequate to tell if you are capturing a sharp image.  However, it is adequate for purposes of composition.  You can always review the image on the large view screen after capture.  Plus, with one button push, the image is magnified and magnification can be increased with a turn of the rear wheel.  I find an eye level finder to be mandatory.  I am not used to holding a camera up and inches away from my eyes to compose and shoot using a large view screen.  MANY newer cameras are lacking an eye level finder of any kind.  The SONY a6000 has an eye level finder, but it is not well situated (at least for my taste).  It is located in the upper left of the rear body and flat against the rear.  Using it places your nose against the large view screen thus smearing the screen with normal nose skin oil!  The eye level finder on the a3000 is centrally located at the top of the body and it protrudes rearwards a bit.  My nose still touches the large view screen, but in the upper right - MUCH LESS problematic.Today, 7/27/2015, I returned the a3000 and 55-250 lens to Amazon.  This was a VERY difficult decision in view of the excellent image quality.  The problem, and reason I returned the SONY, was the horrendous resolution of both the eye level finder and the rear view screen.  It was like the olden days of film when you had to process the film to see what kind of results you had.  I could NOT tell almost anything about my SONY images, other than composition, until I got home and opened them with Photoshop.To quote another recent reviewer: The thing with the screen is that more often then not, I'll get home, load up my pictures on my PC and think Dang, those look so much better than I thought they were!""I also did not like the delay upon awakening with the SONY.  That does not exist with my Canon T3i.  Unlike one reviewer who explained that he preserves battery life by switching his SONY ON and OFF between photos, I like to leave my camera ON so I do not miss a photo opportunity.  To conserve battery, the camera times out and goes into sleep mode.  It takes some bit of time to awaken.  In that fraction of time, you have missed the photo opportunity.Until mirrorless cameras improve their ergonomics and viewfinders (see my comments on the Olympus OM D-10), I will have to stick with a mirror and pentaprism, regardless of the added weight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZF0IQBWODOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EH5UGR6#wasThisHelpful","R14ZF0IQBWODOK","A2730CR657291E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2730CR657291E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this camera as one of my failed attempts to replace my beloved Canon T3i + Sigma 18-250 with something a LOT lighter for traveling.  I simply cannot walk around with 2.5 pounds hanging from my body anymore.  I get a terrible backache.The camera and kit lens took excellent photos (see attached samples - the ""bouquet was shot from a distance and cropped, the hibiscus was also shot from several feet away - not a macro shot).  BUT ...1 - While others have commented on poor battery life, there HAD to be something wrong with the one I had!  In ONE hour's time, the camera ate through 20% of the battery capacity.  That is while walking around shooting perhaps 25 still images.  NO VIDEO.  NO rapid imaging.  It is possible that part of the problem was the camera constantly switching between eye level finder and rear display (until I figured out how to turn the rear display off).  I did see that one commenter, an engineer, discovered that the constant wifi is a battery drain with this camera.  MAYBE that is the remedy.  BUT, probably not with the unit I had.  It was likely defective.2 - Also, likely indicative of a defective unit, the area of the camera grip around the battery compartment got quite warm.  True, it was over 90 degrees that day, BUT ...!3 - One of the reasons I bought a SONY was the possibility of using my old SONY/Minolta AF lenses.  In a call with SONY, I learned that the brand name adapter is $200.  BUT, it is 100% mechanical and offers NO electronic connections between camera and lens.  YES, you can use your SONY/Minolta mount lenses with the adapter (BTW, there are many generics available for around $20-30), but all operations will be manual.  I dare say that most casual photographers today have zero idea what an f stop is and how it affects your image.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PJBPN3H361V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8BICB2#wasThisHelpful","R9PJBPN3H361V","A2730CR657291E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2730CR657291E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I am aging, I find that I get a terrible backache carrying 2.5 pounds of camera + lens around my neck or on my shoulders.  I bought a Nikon Coolpix L840 in the hope of getting a fairly lightweight camera suitable for traveling.  I was hoping that this model did not have much ""shutter lag.""  NOTE: A few years ago, I had bought and returned a Nikon D5100 because of obvious quality control problems.  NOTABLY, the D5100 would NOT focus.  BUT, Nikon still has ""the reputation,"" so I gave the manufacturer another chance.  BIG MISTAKE!Problems:1 - The camera apparently has the same of similar design/manufacturing problems as the D5100.  It had trouble focusing.  I don't mean focus quickly.  I mean focus at all.2 - Whether a lens, sensor or software problem is unknown to me, but virtually EVERY image taken with this camera required post camera CONTRAST correction.Before any of the Nikon lovers again attack me; I do NOT work for Canon.  I am an experienced amateur photographer and know what I am doing.It IS possible that this one unit was defective, just as it was possible that the D5100 I had was a single defective unit.  The reviews of others tend to belie this defense.My conclusion is simple: Nikon has gotten lazy or is too focused on profits and is cutting corners.  Until and unless they examine their engineering and quality control, I cannot recommend any Nikon product and certainly NOT the Coolpix L840.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTDHBAJJO5YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T85P56C#wasThisHelpful","R2UTDHBAJJO5YV","A2730CR657291E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2730CR657291E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found Adobe Photoshop Elements to be much better suited to my needs AND easier to use based on my experience and amateur familiarity with older versions of Photoshop.  I needed a newer version of Photoshop to be able to handle the ""raw"" images from my then new Canon EOS T3i.

My son-in-law is comfortable with Lightroom and uses it well, so I tried it.  I found it to be vastly different from previous generations of the full Photoshop software.  Even after trying it, I am not certain I understand the differences.  The major difference MAY BE that Lightroom allows across the board corrections and modifications over many images at once, whereas Elements allows image by image manipulation.  Without extensive reading, study and tutorials, I had difficulty figuring out how to work on a single image at a time with Lightroom.

"Until recently I'd been using a Penn-Plax ""Daily Double"" automatic feeder.  It lasted me more than a decade but the plastic of the food bin dried out and, ultimately, the retaining tabs broke off.  I was never very happy with it for two reasons: 1) I do NOT feed my fish twice a day.  Once a day, and probably once every other day, is sufficient.  As the name implies, the ""daily double"" feeds twice a day and is not adjustable.  I looked at the half dozen or so models of automatic feeder available through Amazon (isn't Amazon awesome!  And, no, I did NOT get paid to write that) that are under $30.  I read user reviews.  I looked and looked at the photos.  I settled on this one for a number of reasons, notably the alleged protection of the food from moisture from the tank.  Looking at the photos, it appeared that the food reservoir of this model sits far above the water and is likely to stay dry.  In actual use, the food reservoir DOES sit 1.5 inches above the top of the tank edge and probably 2 inches or so above the water surface when the tank is ""full"".  I also did not want a unit with a Velcro mounting system.  I prefer a clamping device.  Finally, I wanted a unit with a reasonable mechanism for adjusting the amount of food delivered at a feeding and one that allows for once daily feedings.  This unit appears to allow a fairly accurate method for adjusting the amount of food delivered AND from one to four daily feedings.NOTE: For automatic feeding, I use a blend of flakes, algae discs (although I am convinced that my Pleco ignores them) and shrimp pellets.  HOWEVER, I grind all of them up with a mortar and pestle to a fairly fine granular consistency.  I do this because of experience with the Penn-Plax Daily Double feeder.  Other reviewers have observed that flake food does not flow well through many feeders.  I have seen flakes that are quite large and I could understand them getting stuck in some feeders.A few notes to help the next buyer:1 - In order to get the cover of the battery case open, you MUST at least partially ""slide"" the feeder off the rails of the tank clamp mount.  The instructions do not mention this (well, maybe they do in Chinese on the back, but NOT in English).  I found that the fit between the feeder and the mounting rails was SO SNUG that I needed a small hammer and some careful tapping to budge it.  Once I had moved the feeder far enough, the battery compartment was easily opened.2 - Programming was actually not very difficult.  The instructions, although obviously translated from another language into English, are not hard to follow.  Others had trouble with programming.  I did NOT.3 - Removing the food reservoir is NOT difficult if you look at the photo in the instructions.  The reservoir literally slides off as a unit (the black base will still be attached to the transparent cover).  DO NOT TWIST IT.  The axle has a ""key"" ridge.  Pull gently from the bottom of the feeder.  BTW, if you have already installed the batteries, watch where you hold the device when you pull.  If you touch the ""on demand"" feeder button, the reservoir will rotate.  The black base, that must be removed to add food to the reservoir, is bayonet mounted onto the reservoir.  NOW, a slight twist is required,  BUT only slight.  Maybe 1/8 to 1/4 inch.After a few days of ""running"" on which I was watching at the set feeding time and saw NO drum rotation, I returned the defective feeder bought another identical one.

"Maimonides, possibly the originator of the ""golden rule,"" (do unto others as you would have done to you, although Maimonides wrote it as in a negative form, do not do to others what you do not like done to you), was a GREAT man in so many respects.  I have long sought a compilation of his sayings but had trouble finding one until I came across this book.  I was not interested in reading Maimonides complete works or even his ""Guide for the Perplexed.""  The reason I only gave this book 3 stars is due to the extremely dense writing style of the author.  I TRIED to wade through the 30+ page introduction and had extreme difficulty.  THANKFULLY, the quotes from Maimonides are MUCH better written (or translated) and MUCH easier to comprehend.  I had the distinct feeling that Twersky is an academic trying to impress other academics.  While I spent 12 years in universities, I am NOT an academic.  I appreciate plain and understandable language.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRREIGLTSMTX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874412064#wasThisHelpful","RRREIGLTSMTX7","A2730CR657291E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2730CR657291E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a music critic nor a professional musician, so I am not qualified to give that kind of a critique.  I know what I enjoy!  This three CD set is AWESOME and would be so at three times the price.  As with other CDs from the Canadian Madacy Music Group, Inc., the recordings are of excellent technical sound quality.  The arrangements and performances, predominantly by the Vienna Opera Orchestra, are delightful.  Even the novice to Viennese waltz music will recognize some of the pieces.  Others were completely unknown to me.  ALL were wonderful.

I have used lavender essential oil on its own and that has helped me relax, but this works so much better because of all the other essential oils that are included.

I love that all of the ingredients are natural and organic also. Hyaluronic acid has always made my face look very hydrated and I make sure that it is an ingredient in all of my serums, so I was happy to see it included in this Zen Power Serum. I also like the way Matrixyl and Collagen work on my skin, especially as I get older. My face appears more youthful and my wrinkles and fine lines are much less noticeable. I have only had to use one pump of this serum to cover my face. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. It has a subtle herbal scent.

"This speaker has a great sound quality for its small size. It works very well for the price. It is very small, so it's easy to carry and store. I had to charge the speaker before I could use it. This only took about 2 1/2 hours. The band of light on the speaker will glow red when it needs to be charged and it will be blue when it is ready to use. There is an on and off button near the bottom of the speaker. It is a toggle switch. Next to the on/off button are 3 buttons to control the volume, change songs, and pause. There is an operation manual included that explains all of the buttons and how it use the speaker. It is very simple to use. There is a voice prompt for things like pairing. I had no problems pairing it with my IPhone 4s. I like that it also comes with an audio cable, so I can connect it to my IPod that doesn't have Bluetooth. It comes with a charging cable too.

I made sure to rub my skin in a circular motion for 60 seconds before rinsing it off. It has a cooling sensation when on my skin and has a nice fresh scent. My skin felt very, very soft when I rinsed off this gel. It also made the skin on my hands look renewed.

"This pet stain and odor remover is amazing. I foster kittens and I have a kitten room that I put them all in. I have had 7 kittens in there at a time. I don't like to have to leave them in a kennel, so I let them loose in the room. The problem with that, is that they will make a mess. Most are pretty good with using a litter box, but there are times when I will find messes on a blanket that I left laying on the floor. They have also gone on the tile floor. The tile is much easier to clean up, but I worry about the odor remaining and them starting to use that area over and over again. This stain and odor remover works wonders. It took the stain and odor out of the blanket. I kept an eye on the kittens and they didn't even give the blanket an extra sniff, so I knew that the odor was totally gone.

I like to use it when I travel because I use a manual toothbrush, but I can also use it on my electric toothbrush head. Both toothbrush heads fit securely in front of the UV light and are held in place by a rubber clip. After closing the lid, the UV light comes on automatically and lasts for 6 minutes.

"This charcoal deodorizer bag works very well on pet odors. I have 2 cats and foster kittens, so I have a few litter boxes that I have to worry about smelling up the room that they are in. I have used plug-ins and sprays, but they just mask the smell. It might smell good for a short time, but there is still that litter box odor in the air. I keep looking for new things to try, so when I was offered to receive this at a discount in exchange for my review, I was excited. For some reason, I thought that the bag would be bigger, so I wasn't sure how well it would work when I saw how small it was. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it eliminated the odor though. The room that I used it in is a bedroom and I made sure that I placed it near the litter boxes, so I think that really helped. I am very glad that this is non-toxic and pet friendly, so I don't have to worry it being around my cats and kittens.

"These leaf claws are amazing. I love having trees in my yard, but it is such a chore to clean up all of the leaves when they start falling. There is still no way around the raking, but these leaf claws make picking up the piles so much easier. I used to use the rake and one hand to pick up the piles, but that still didn't allow me to pick up as much as these claws do. I am a woman with small hands and I found that my hands fit nicely into the areas of the handle, so I was able to maintain a secure grip while using the claws. There's really no need to wear gloves while using these claws because your hands stay away from everything since they are on the outside of the claws. The claws are pretty big and can pick up quite a few leaves at a time, so the pile disappears in no time. They are shaped so that one fits inside the other (stacked) for easy storage. There are holes in the tops of the claws, so they can be hung on a hook or nail in the garage.

"I think that this flask with a built in shot glass is such a cool idea. It maintains the classic flask shape while having a collapsible shot glass built right in. The flask feels like it is well made, solid, and very durable. I like the look of the leather, including the leather circle in the middle of the bottom of the shot glass. It adds a classy look. I love that the top is attached to the flask, so there is no worry about losing it. The top screws on tightly, allowing nothing to spill out. The collapsible shot glass is very easy to pull out of the flask. The shot glass is very sturdy and when it is fully extended, it stays that way and doesn't collapse on its own. I like that there is a small funnel included in this set, because it makes it easier to fill the flask. It is small though, so it would also be easy to misplace.

"I love this carrier oil stick. I have just gotten into using essential oils and I usually use them in my diffuser. I read that I had to use a carrier oil, if I wanted to use them topically. I have some Jojoba essential oil, so I used that as my carrier oil and it was okay, but to me, it was a little messy with so much oil. This is a perfect solution for me. I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a carrier oil solid stick that I could use. I think that people definitely need to start using this and spread the word, so others know about it. It really makes using essential oils easy and convenient. I rolled this stick over the area where I wanted to put my essential oils and then added a couple drops of the essential oils on top of it, then massaged it in. Of course, the area was slightly oily, but nowhere near as oily as it was when I used a liquid carrier oil. I like the fact that this solid carrier oil helps my skin absorb 80% more of the essential oils to make using the essential oil more beneficial to me.

"It's amazing how much this kinesiology tape helps my knee. I experience pain in my outer knee area whenever I run or do squats and lunges. I enjoy doing these exercises and I don't want to have to stop because of the pain, so this tape is perfect for me. I found a Youtube video specifically related to taping my outer knee, so I watched it a few times before applying the tape. I like that this tape is not precut because I need different lengths of tape for my knee. I have to stretch and bend the tape in certain areas when I tape my knee, so my first time taping was kind of tricky and it didn't come out that well. It didn't take me long to get the hang of it though and it became very easy to do. My knee feels much more stable when I have it taped and I also don't experience the pain that I used to.

"I have just gotten into essential oils and use most of them in a diffuser, so I was very excited to try this immune boast essential oil blend that I could use topically. I love using natural remedies and I have noticed some great results with the essential oils I have used so far. It seems like since entering perimenopause, my immune system doesn't work as well as it used to, so I find myself not feeling all that great quite often. I like that this blend contains the carrier oils, Jojoba Oil and Sunflower Oil, so I can use it directly on my skin. I did not realize the importance of carrier oils when I first started. Most of the essential oils contained in this blend have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it great to help boost the immune system. I have used some of the essential oils on their own, but never in a blend like this. I absolutely love the smell of this oil blend. It's hard for me to describe because it contains so many different fragrant oils and none of them overpower any of the others. They just combine to make an amazing scent. I have used this oil on the bottoms of my feet at night and I have also inhaled it. The only thing that bothers me about using it on my feet, is that the oil gets on my sheets. I don't like wearing socks to bed, so I am not sure how I am going to get around this. I would rather use it on my feet during the day. I have felt a difference since using this though. I have been feeling much better and stronger, so I look forward to seeing how I feel a month from now.

In fact, I didn't fill the infuser all the way up and my tea still tasted nice and strong. The pants are shaped so that they are easy to hold and fill with tea leaves. I had no problems pushing the top of the little guy onto the pants for a secure seal. The guys arms fit well on my smaller cup and it allowed the pants to sit low in the hot water. I tried my bigger Starbucks mug at first and the pants didn't sink as low in the water, so I didn't feel that it infused as well as it did in my smaller cup. I also noticed that some of the smaller tea leaves escaped into my water, so I try to use longer tea leaves, if I can. There weren't a whole lot, so it didn't really bother me. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this infuser was to clean. I was able to discard most of the tea leaves into the trash with no problems. I thought for sure they would get stuck in the legs, but that didn't happen. I was then able to rinse the rest out in the sink. These little guys would make a great gift for tea lovers.

"These non-stick silicone baking mats work very well. I really like the size (16.6"" x 11"") because they fit well on my baking sheets. I also like how thick they are. They feel very well made and durable. I have used these mats to cook chicken wings, French fries, pork chops, and cookies. Everything bakes very evenly. My cookies don't burn on the bottoms. It's nice not have to use aluminum foil all of the time to line my baking sheets or to have to spray them with cooking spray. I love that the mats don't absorb any flavors and that nothing sticks to them. They are easy to clean and they don't stain. I store mine rolled up in a rubber band, but they stay flat as soon as I lay them on the cookie sheets.

"I have always loved the taste of matcha green tea in smoothies, so I was excited to be able to make them on my own with this powder. I like that this powder is 100% pure organic matcha tea. I know exactly what I am putting in my body. I was happy to see that this powder contains over 1300 antioxidants which is even more than what is in a cup of green tea. I have never liked drinking hot tea, so I am glad that I can get my antioxidants using this in a cold drink. My favorite way to use this powder, is in my protein shake. I mix protein powder, almond milk, and a teaspoon of this powder in my blender bottle. I do have to shake it quite a few times to get the powder to fully mix in and not have any lumps. The taste is amazing and totally worth it though. This powder doesn't have any sweeteners in it, so I would not recommend drinking it on its own unless you are okay with a more bitter taste. It's perfect for adding that green tea taste to smoothies, lattes, or protein shakes though. I like the energy that this powder gives me without giving me the jitters which I tend to experience if I have too much caffeine. I am looking forward to seeing if I experience any weight loss after using it for a while longer.

"I love this weather station. I have been using a different indoor/outdoor temperature monitor, but it is not as near as nice as this one. This one is truly a whole weather station. The first thing that I love about it, is its large display. I have it sitting in my living room and I can easily see all of the information just by glancing over at it. I was able to place the outdoor sensor a good distance away and it was still able to communicate with the console. There are some things that I needed to set up before using this weather station, but the instruction manual is detailed and very easy to follow. The diagrams that are included in the instructions also helped me a lot. After installing batteries (not included) in the sensor (2 AAA) and the console (2 AA), I had to select the channel that I wanted to use for them to communicate to each other. Again, this is explained in detail and I had no trouble setting this up. The channel indicator is displayed in the top right hand corner above the outside temperature. As soon as I placed the sensor outside, the temperature started to adjust on the console. The temperature can be displayed in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. I was then able to set the time and date. There is also an alarm feature, if you want to use this as an alarm clock. I love that the display shows the outdoor temperature, indoor temperature and humidity, current weather, date, and time. It's nice to be able to get all of that information from one console. I like the design of the console and I think that even though the display is large, it fits nicely into any room.

"We bought this Roomba 880 robot vacuum cleaner to help clean our family vacation apartment. The apartment is only about 700 sq feet and is occupied for about 3-4 months of the year, so lots of dust accumulates between visits. I have a very severe dust mite allergy, and I usually sneeze for most of the time we are in the apartment, even if we damp dust and HEPA vacuum it with our Dyson canister vacuum cleaner soon after we arrive. I was very curious (and skeptical) to see whether Minnie (our Roomba) could alleviate these symptoms and reduce our cleaning workload while on vacation.The apartment has mixed surfaces. About two thirds of it is tiled and the rest is carpet, including the bedrooms. The floor plan is fairly open, except that the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms are separate along a corridor. This is important when considering how to use the robot most efficiently. Now that we have had Minnie for around a month, I have to say that she (has to be a she - the error messages are all given by a female voice!) does a superb job. My husband is an efficient demon with the Dyson, doing a VERY thorough job. However, he insists that Minnie does a better job than he can. My allergies have improved hugely. So much so, that we are going to have to buy a second Roomba for our home.Now for some nitty gritty:Pros1. Does a fantastic job, probably better than most humans2. Happily goes under beds, eliminating those dust bunnies which make me sneeze all night3. Very easy to use4. Very easy to empty the bin and clean the filter - takes about 2 minutes, maximum. Good idea to clean the HEPA filter with a handheld vacuum like the Dyson models, to prolong filter life5. Virtual wall lighthouses work very well, once you understand their intricacies6. Can be left unattended or scheduled to clean while you are away, once you have Roomba-prepped the area to be cleaned7. Massively reduces the dust load in a home, far more than human vacuuming can reasonably do. Be aware that the first few times in a carpeted room, you may need to empty the bin every 15 mins or so. It really is that good at picking up dust. Be prepared to babysit the robot constantly at first!8. Much quieter than a standard manual HEPA vacuum, but don't expect to be able to hold a telephone conversation with someone on a bad cellphone connection when you are 3 yards away from it9. Decent battery life. Probably about 3.5 hours on our machine. We can now clean the whole apartment in less than 2 hours - no need to recharge. However the first few cleanings, particularly on carpet areas, took much longer than this, and required an overnight charge to finish.10. I have long hair - about 4 inches below the shoulder. Minnie picks it all up, even from carpet. It can wrap around the rollers, but simply removing the rollers and tugging on the hair pulls most of it away in one neat coil. Much easier than brush vacuum cleaners!Cons (most of these are minor design niggles, and I have tried to suggest a way to work with them)1. Instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired. It is fairly brief, and tells you most of the essentials, but it doesn't help you to understand how to use your Roomba most effectively. The iRobot web site doesn't fill in the gaps. You either have to learn from experience, or Google and hope that you find the answer2. Some of the information in the manual is misleading. For example, the cleaning patterns illustrated are not how the 880 works. If you start cleaning from the Home Base, the Roomba does a sort of random straight line scribble over the whole room, not a spiral and straight edge clean as displayed in the manual. It will pay special attention to edges, but the cleaning pattern is not as illustrated. I am certain that many engineers who own Roombas may be on the verge of a nervous breakdown if they watch this apparently random pattern. Having said that, our Minnie does pick up >99% of ""bits"" that I have noticed before starting her. This includes bread crumbs, hairs, lint, onion and garlic papery skins, grit from drilling the wall, etc. Just be patient and don't obsessively watch - she will get it.3. Virtual wall light houses are essential for an efficient clean, and their use is very poorly described in the manual. From a combination of experience and reading, I have come up with the following:a) Virtual wall lighthouses (VWLH) supplied with the 880 (2 of them) can be used to divide up a complex shaped area to clean it more efficiently. When you start Roomba, it counts how many VWLH are present (seems like it may only be able to count to 3 though!), then immediately starts cleaning the starting area where you first pressed the Clean button. All of the VWLH devices go into Virtual Wall mode at this point, penning the Roomba into the area you designated. According to iRobot.com, the Roomba will clean that first area until it is clean, or for a maximum of 25 mins. With Minnie, this is NOT true. For the first few uses, she would clean an area for over 45 mins, so the online info is not necessarily accurate. Once Roomba has finished the first area, the closest VWLH will then go into ""lighthouse"" mode, allowing Roomba to cross into the next area. Once she has passed into that area, it becomes a virtual wall again, keeping her in the new zone until Roomba has finished cleaning it. It then reverts to lighthouse mode, allowing the robot to exit the area and proceed to the next area protected by a VWLH, if any. This process is repeated until the segregated zones are cleaned, at which point the Roomba returns to its home base.b) Light house placement is somewhat critical. The VWLH and the Home Base both emit a kind of ""halo"" of a no-go zone around themselves, so that the robot can't nudge them out of position. It seems to be about 8-10 inches in radius. This means that you must not place the home base too close to a doorway where you intend to use a VWLH, or the two will interfere, and the robot may not clean the room. We have found that the best placement is on the far side of a threshold, behind, but level with the door frame. Experience will teach you what works best for you.c) If you are cleaning a narrow hallway, do not put the home base on one of the long walls, as the robot may get confused and stay down one end of the hall for much of the cleaning cycle (yes, I have done this). The halo effect can block a lot of the corridor and make it hard for Roomba to navigate along it past the home base or VWLH. You will know this is happening if Roomba keeps pirouetting on the spot before moving on to an area it has already cleaned. Happens with VWLHs as well as Home base - so place them both thoughtfully!4. Blinking lights are not well explained. For example:a) A blue starfish light on top of Roomba means that the side brush is slowing down. If the robot is on a deep pile carpet, it may just be friction from that. If not, you need to stop it and untangle any accumulated crud from the side brush under the robotb) A flashing blue magnifying glass usually means that Roomba has detected extra dirt. This light will usually change to the signal described in c), but if it doesn't you may need to clean the counter-rotating rubber rollers as described in the manual, and wipe out the channel under those (when the machine is upside down) to the collector bin. The dirt detector in the 880 is an optical sensor (not acoustic as in older models) above the rollers in the channel to the bin - if it gets very dirty, it can give false signals.c) A solid blue magnifying glass means that Roomba is in intensive clean mode. Now this gets confusing... If it goes into this mode itself, it will do a fan-shaped back and forth motion over about a 1 yard area. If it is showing this icon after you pressed the Spot clean button, it will spiral over about the same area, unless it hits something, at which point it will go back to normal cleaning mode. Don't stress, it is cleaning!  :)5. We have never heard a full bin warning. It would be helpful if it was either used, or nice and loud! The machine does not stop cleaning when the bin is full, so you may want to clean again if you find it with a full bin, as it is obviously not very efficient in this condition.6. It is hard to get error messages replayed. The manual says to press Clean once to replay them, but when we have done this, the robot just starts cleaning again. Oh well, I guess it fixed itself?7. If you do have severe allergies, you don't want to be anywhere near this when it is cleaning. I sneeze constantly and get red itchy eyes if I am in the same room. Hardly surprising when you see the side brush spinning - it must throw dust and hair/fur up into the air. Having said that, it is really no worse than a manual vacuum cleaner, which throws up dust mechanically and also from the exhaust disturbing the floor layer. In my case, my husband is the lead babysitter for Minnie when she is cleaning. Nice for me!8. Some room prep is really needed for a MUCH better clean. Common sense stuff. Roomba will not suck up thick power cords, but it will tangle on the thinner iPhone/iPad/MacBook charging cables and similar. Also socks, small toys etc. can block the rollers. We lift dining chairs and place them upside down on the dining table (like restaurants) to get the best crumb patrol in the dining room. Light furniture needs to have delicate items moved - Roomba can hit it quite hard the first few times, and your smashed fine porcelain vase may end up in Roomba's collection bin.OK, apologies for the long review, but I wanted to convey accurately just how good this device is. The supporting documentation needs extensive reworking, but the vacuum cleaner is outstanding. When it finally wears out, we will certainly buy another. We can't imagine living without Minnie, now that we have seen what a great job she does. If you follow the instructions for user maintenance, regularly empty the bin and clean the rollers, brush and filters (and wipe down the machine), you may be as amazed as me at how much your allergies can improve with a Roomba in your home.  Goodbye Kleenex, hello Roomba!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UCD5QS3A9SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IO9PBPS#wasThisHelpful","R18UCD5QS3A9SM","AMKOS4JDWYD0U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKOS4JDWYD0U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought these covers for our Tesla remotes after we had dropped them once or twice. The remotes scratch easily, and we were worried that they may even chip or shatter. The neoprene-like fabric of this cover offers decent protection.A few comments:1. They come as one per package. Tesla gives you two remotes, so you will need to buy 2 Kotes if you want to protect both2. They are pretty expensive for a little piece of fabric, but hey, we are Tesla owners! Doesn't compare with the price of the vehicle! Also, every 40 miles we drive, we save enough in unused gas to buy one of these covers...  :)3. They are a VERY tight fit. It works best if you put the remote into the inner part of the Kote first, then stretch the outer pocket over the other end (see photos)4. I put the flat side of the remote against the overlap of the fabric, to make it easier to feel which part of the remote you are pressing. That way you don't open the frunk when you meant to open the trunk, etc.In summary, these remote covers do the job well, although they are expensive. It would be nice if they shipped in packs of two as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCM6W329E0WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKOO82C#wasThisHelpful","R2FCM6W329E0WI","AMKOS4JDWYD0U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKOS4JDWYD0U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a modern freezer with a plumbed in icemaker. However we disconnected the water to the icemaker for several reasons. First, the connections leaked after a couple of years, second the ice always glued together, third we never used ice fast enough for it to taste good.This tray is a perfect replacement for us. The first thing to understand is how it is non-spill. Remember that experiment in high school where you fill a glass with water and then place a dampened card on top? You can turn the glass upside down without any water leaking (for a while). This works the same way - air pressure and surface tension holds the water in the wells, so fill the wells up to the top with water, and expel all of the excess air and water under the silicone mat. Then you will be leak free, up to a point - just like the glass of water in school.Second brilliant design point is the shape of the ice cubes. They are half moons. As water freezes, it expands initially. This means that at normal freezer temperatures, the ice cube occupies more space than the initial water-fill did. So what? Well, now the ice cube develops a little lip and virtually pops itself out of the tray! Fantastic - these are the easiest removal ice cubes I have ever made. The counterpoint to this is that once frozen, the silicone lid no longer seals well enough to protect the cubes from freezer odors, so use them fast, or store them sealed in another container within a day or two.Very happy with this tray and recommend it without reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUG6RSOWQML2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007U256D2#wasThisHelpful","R3GUG6RSOWQML2","AMKOS4JDWYD0U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKOS4JDWYD0U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This seal shipped in an envelope and arrived with several kinks in the rounded surface, due to being folded by the packaging. I hoped that these would straighten out, but even after several weeks, they remain visible. A bigger issue we are having with it is getting it to stick to our shower door. We bought the recommended hi-bond adhesive tape and cleaned everything thoroughly with a recommended solvent (isopropyl alcohol) before we started. The tape sticks beautifully to the shower door, but the seal seems to be too slippery for the tape to fix in place. We left the seal undisturbed for 3 days, but it still didn't stick properly. We have tried 3 fresh applications of tape now, and we cannot get it to hold.

"This necklace arrived and I could hear it screaming from the bag as I picked it up... ""cheap  plastic!!!  What you're seeing in the pictures as the black markings, is actually paint on a backing.

This and the earrings have ridges running up and down.  Those ridges remind me of those old school cafeteria plastic glasses with the ridges running around the top.  The ridges detract rather than add anything.  The gold colored caps are not touching the plastic gemstone and, instead, flare out which gives it an unfinished look.  Note that those earrings are short.  It clearly shows that, so that's not their fault.  Just a little odd with a massive piece of costume jewelry.  he cap. The gold coloring isn't nearly so ""elegant"" as the picture.  The larger gem and the earrings are some type of see thru plastic (which is very obvious), and those are ridges that run up and down... if you look close to the picture you can see them (wish I had looked closer).  And look at those caps on the earring and the the piece hanging down.  To add insult to injury, they actually smeared the reddish color that's on the leaves, onto the gold or brassy chain.

"Kudos to the photographer on this one. The earrings are not even close to being as pretty as what's pictured.  I don't remember if I paid shipping with this.  If I did, I got suckered.  If not, I still paid too much.  This is typical  1950's ""Dime-Store"" and ""Flea Market""  costume jewelry.  These earrings scream ""I am soooooo cheap!  The fake gemstones are not evening shiny.

I don't see how anyone could like these who's over 5 years old.  Even if you're poor (and I am not rich), I wouldn't wear these even for fun as they are really cheap looking at any distance.

"I don't know why we even use soup spoons as our version is so messy and they're not deep enough to get more than a minor bite. You just can' get but very few veggies and liquid in a normal soup spoon.  Liquid sloshes down my blouse on my chin.  Maybe I'm just a messy diner.  I'm old and this has happened to me all my life.  I feel like my face is chasing the spoon.  These are great for not having to do that.  However, these do cure all my ills.  Two ways to hold the spoon... neat design.  Catch on the end of the handle so you can put down the spoon without it slipping into the bowl.  And notches at the hand/bowl area of the spoon so you can turn it upside down and prop it up in your bowl.  While either way works, it's just a really neat design.  These are just so so handy, especially for grandchildren and grandparents... We're all messy.  Those in between can claim they're above it all, but I think not as I've seen the drips around the tables and computers.  My husband is in love with these and we ordered three more sets.. one more for us and two for stocking stuffers.  I wanted to get my order in before they could possibly run out.  They came fairly quickly, almost a week.  They're attractive and they stack pretty well.  I doubt they'll stay in the drawer long enough to worry about stacking them though.  Discovered they are the absolute perfect size to measure out my coffee for my two-cup coffee pot... awesome... there goes one.  They've got a reasonable handle length.

"These stories are slipping in this installment.  So far I've enjoyed each of these installments.  However, they are progressively getting more and more out there.  There are so many ghosts now, it's like the whole town is full of them.  They sort of lose their significance when overplayed.  And the story lines are spreading  so thin, I'm having a hard time setting aside my disbelief.  We have not just regular ghosts, we have ghosts who have different talents than just regular ghosts.  A lot is left to your imagination instead of explaining how one ghost can do this and one ghost can't, the story just expects you not to question that.  We have the library ghost, we have the cemetery ghost, and we've added more now.  We have ghosts that are so good they can text you logical conversation, and on the other end we have ghosts who mysteriously and obviously can't do that, don't or can't speak, show up and don't even hand signal.  You're left to guessing what the heck they want and what they are saying.  It's not making sense any more to me.  I don't know if I can be talked into the next one after this, as this one was barely tolerable. And the main character has questionable character to me.  She breaks promises and seems inconsiderate to her boyfriend.  She's just not honest and justifies it on really thin threads of reasoning (actually baffling threads).  I'm starting to feel she's fairly arrogant and dishonest and I don't feel for her like I used to in the previous installments.

"This is sort of like a girdle, but not quite as tight.  If you get it smaller, it could be tight and hold you in well.  It is great for  not ""jiggling"" around.  The lower one third has a very nice lightweight panel which keeps that area from getting overly hot.  It was very warm yesterday and I did a lot of activity.  These panties did not add to my temperature and I didn't even notice I had them on during my inflicted exercise.  They weren't as  high on me as they are shown in the picture.  But I think that's because I have body form issues.  Washes well.  The only problem I had with these was in using the ladies lounge.  These were more difficult to get back up and down...  However, they were pliable enough that you could push your hands inside and press outwards, enhancing your ability to get the things back up.

"The exact color that is on my screen.  I wanted something light for bed coverage and this color matches with my bedroom.  The material is quilted, yet it's like a bedspread in that it is pliable enough to drape over the bed.  I didn't think it was too stiff.  I have a velour type blanket underneath and as my first cover.  My older comforter set made it too hot to sleep with both over me.  This is just the right amount.  I live in N. Alabama, so the temps don't get much lower than freezing except on the rare occasion.  Even so, I like having my blankets underneath my top cover and will add another blanket if necessary.  I purchased a King and the shams are regular pillow size.  So, that could be a drawback for some.  Since this is the color in my room I wanted to match, I have plenty of pillows that match this when I have company and want my room looking extra good.  The cover is on a Queen sized bed and cover it generously.  I wanted the King size as my matteresses and box springs are very thick and my bed is very high off the ground.  The King goes 25 inches to the floor and covers the pillows generously at the top and folds back nicely on a queen size bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LI1BUVIWA95W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013L0XZ0C#wasThisHelpful","R2LI1BUVIWA95W","A2LYT2QET2KC4N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LYT2QET2KC4N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these.  These are awesome, and very attractive.  They pour perfectly just as their name indicates, without dribbling all over the place.. and with the longer spout.. the pictures don't do that spout justice, I can aim for my coffee pot's water tank and hit it perfectly.  You know that filling that tank up and be a pain in the rump.  I have a 4-5 cup coffee maker and I was having a time filling it.  I would use the pot and fill it with water which is a pain or I would use other things around my kitchen.  I just cut to the chase and ordered these.  The spout in the picture looks a little blunted... In ""real life"" the spout is a good bit longer, given you perfect control over where stuff ends up.  And...and they hang by their handles perfectly.  I was able to hang them in on an overhead kitchen rack between two lines of beautiful coffee cups.  They're not very obvious there.. but they are easy to grab on a daily basis.  These will take up cabinet space as the set is large, especially with the handles and the snouts being a bit longer than they look.  While the snouts  (no dribbling) and the handles (can be hung up) are the biggest selling point for me... might not be for everyone because of the space required to store them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCY74WQJ4FLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Y43HP0#wasThisHelpful","R2HCY74WQJ4FLI","A2LYT2QET2KC4N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LYT2QET2KC4N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just great to get rid of the ashtray smell you get by leaving an ashtray sitting around, it's much neater as you don't have the ashes flying everywhere at the least little ac or fan breeze, or just the breeze of walking by, you don't have to worry about knocking it over and dumping ashes all over the floor or on the rug or around your desk.  Once you spin your cigarette butt into the tank, it's gone and dies.  No picking around in the butts to find which one is not out yet... no smoke from a not completely dying butt.  I still don't empty my ashtrays for at least six hours just as a fire safety measure, and these ashtrays don't look all nasty sitting around.  And, these are great outside on your patio or porch.... definitely with the breezes that come thru.

"I've read in some of the comments that there is not a  hot-plate here, that it's ""just"" the thermal pot that keeps the coffee warm.  Well, my hot plate is working just fine.  It also turns off after an approximately one hour.  I love this little pot and it's just perfect for my husband and me.  We get up at different times.  With this pot it is just so easy for me to have my two cups, prepare the pot for when he gets up, and then he can have a fresh two cups of coffee also.  It's also nice for making a cup for late afternoon or dinner.  I like that it doesn't take up near the space that the other pot did.  It is just so much neater on my counter.  I can now place this smaller coffee maker in a more convenient location.  The other coffee pot seemed to take up quite a bit of space (needed pull out and rotate room to fill water tank).  Filling the water was a hassle as I had to pull the whole thing out from under the cabinet and turn it around in order to get the water in the tank.  I found the ""perfect"" measuring cups set and use the four-cup container to fill this pot.  They have the long spouts with the stabilizer catch which catches on the side of the pot and with the long snout, pours into this pot perfectly without dribble.  This pot is the perfect height for under the counter.  I like the heavy thermal pot (so much easier to clean), I'm saving by not using as much coffee, and it looks really nice.  I haven't used the programmable function as it only takes four minutes to make coffee.  It will take more water than four cups, I fill the container pretty much to the top, and use 1/3 cup of coffee, and my coffee is strong the way I like it.  My husbands kicks it back as he likes weaker coffee.  I'm glad I switched and ditched...the old pot. UPDATE:  I still love this coffee pot a couple of months later.  In fact, I like it more today than when I first wrote the review.  I've saved a lot on coffee. I'm only sorry I didn't go downsize sooner.  Making coffee couldn't be easier or faster.  And one pot enough for more than 2 very large cups of coffee!  Update:  Went belly up this evening.  I am not a happy camper, but it's on sale... and I love it so much, I just bought two more.. one as a back up.  Hopefully, I'm just unlucky in the one I purchased.

"I recently had cataract lens replacement surgery.  While you have 20/20 vision for distance, you will need reading glasses.  I do some reading outside, so I just didn't want to switch back and forth between sunglasses.  Keeping track of one pair is much easier.  I keep them on in the store so I can read the labels on cans and boxes.  I love these.  They are as large ..don't seem as large as shown, but close and I also love that they are large.  I hate looking thru those granny glasses because I end up feeling like I'm looking thru a frame as I can clearly see the frames.  It's like strapping binoculars to your face... you get that vision surrounded by frame.  I wanted something larger and more sophisticated that didn't require me to keep tipping them up and down with my hands and really had enough room for the bifocal part... Nothing's more irritating than nodding your head up and down in order to see something.  With these I barely have to move my head.  I also bought these with a clear lens for wearing around the house or at night when I wanted to be able to do both driving and seeing something up close.  So, I love them and I get compliments on them all the time and asked ""Where did you get those?""  ""I didn't know they made these.""  My eye surgeon even asked because she's wanting to have some on hand for those people that can't get them locally... which you can't.

"This is the best spice for meats of all kinds.  It's a fine dust which dissolves easily in soups and gravies.  This dust is great on green beans and other vegetables too.  I love to cook vegetables just slightly in olive or canola oil, and flavoring with this spice but leaving them slightly crispy.  I also use this in stir fries with rice.  I like the slightly smokey peppery taste, it's not an overly or even a very salty taste so it's easy to use in recipes without overpowering the flavor.  It  is especially great as a roast and steak rub.  It's just not for beef, the flavoring is great with chops of all kinds, used as an ingredient in your flour mixture for fried chicken.  Rub down your chicken before baking it, you won't have a piece of chicken left over.  Rubbed on a pork loin that is wrapped in aluminum foil and baked is a huge hit.  It's very versatile and I get raves on my cooking when using this.  I've used this flavoring for years, but couldn't find it any more in grocery or the big warehouse stores.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  I also don't mind buying such a large portion.  My husband and grandsons will grab this spice to take to the table with them to either add more (as I use it lightly), or just to add it in something I didn't.  It's my favorite go-to spice.  Yet, it doesn't make everything taste the same, it enhances the meat or vegetable's flavors instead.

"I just finished this book not five minutes ago and am up at the computer looking for the next book in this series.  One reviewer noted grammatical errors that were distracting to the book?  Really???  This was well written (1st person).  Maybe I was to busy gobbling up the story to notice.. ah well.  Once I started,  this book captured me... for the next two days my Kindle was never more than four feet or arm's length from me as I totally devoured this story.  The characters were all entertaining.  I only had one moment where I thought the story stretched my ability to buy into it...and it wasn't that important to the plot...I just would have gotten Molly there differently.  And, past that, if I wasn't reading the book I was busy filling every idle minute trying to come up with a plausible ""And the killer is....""  My husband even had to wave his hand in front of my face at dinner while we waited for our meals, I was off in La La Land trying to analyze the clues!  I normally don't particularly care for books where the main character is a mom as I consider having children around in a mystery stifles the main character... but these children were just so adorable.. you felt you could just grab, at least,  the little boy up and hug him.  All the suspects were fascinating... not overblown... but not your norma or usual set of characters.  They were all fairly unique...and the dialogue was great!!  These characters were very defined....  I loved her best friend and their sometimes stressful friendship as all friendships are, I loved the Stephanie character with her ""bitchy"" personality...so much so that I found myself memorizing some of her lines to steal and turn on those self-centered  people in my orbit... very creative.  I'd like to give as good as I get...and Stephanie's dialogue is just fantastic...not over done either..but brilliant.  The Tommy character was just so right on... we all know that guy... and he's not the usual dumb cop or overbearing macho guy.  There were several humorous if not down right funny moments too.  I loved her business of doing personal cartoons/e-cards... my own husband is an artist and has done that so many times.... and it's amazing what a creative brain and art talent can do... And, just like Molly, they come to him in synapses and he's constantly grabbing something to jot down his ideas... just like Molly.  Talk about realism!  I especially appreciated those wonderful ideas Molly  kept coming up with that really added so much fun to the story.  The only character that leaves something to be developed is the absent husband.... and that's not unexpected...but can't wait to see if he's going to be as equally entertaining as all the other characters have been once he returns to the fold.  This is definitely a good mystery which will keep you occupied until the last word.  I recommend this book as a great way to pass some hours being entertained not only by the mystery,...but the characters and the humor of the characters and those darn cute cartoons!!!  Happy Reading...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AOVUB4MT3X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFDP7XC#wasThisHelpful","R26AOVUB4MT3X4","A2LYT2QET2KC4N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LYT2QET2KC4N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I almost didn't order this book because of some of the reviews.  I'm glad that I did anyway. .  I haven't been able to put this book down since I started reading it this morning.  This story runs at a good clip....and it's very interesting.  I, unlike others, did not think of the Ghost and Mrs Muir.  This was completely modern and totally different and far more interesting.  While the idea of ghosts is in itself a bit ""out there,"" the story was very plausible... logical... and about the way you might interact with a ghost assuming you could get over the initial fear and shock should you see  one.  The main characters are extremely normal.  The main character and her side-kick are not scatter brained nor given to illogical actions.  There are no exaggerated personality disorders.  There's, nothing to make feel you've stretched your believability too far, not one boring paragraph...you won't skip one single sentence.  I ordered the second book in this series without even reading the synopsis, nor any of the comments just minutes ago.  I'm  holding myself back from starting on it until the laundry is done....talk about suffering.... I can't wait to get started!!  If you like cozy mysteries, and like the idea of spiritual involvement in your story... then you're not going to do any better than this.  Take it from me, I've read well over 400 mysteries since I've had my Kindle just a few years ago...  I have ""deleted""  many books from my Kindle after the first chapter or so as I just can't tolerate anything too nonsensical or droning torturous descriptions of everything...and stories that won't move.

I wasn't charmed with the characters and Daisy has a truth issue.  She's taking money from people for her psychic medium abilities, and she has none.  So, she's a fraudster.  I could go with that, but the book isn't comedy and Daisy rationalizes that she's comforting people and therefore it is okay to lie to them.  The book is mostly her running up to the rich folks house to comfort a complete ninny and then back home to deal with her handicapped husband.

Sometimes it will stall on a large can, or if the rim is smashed up a little.  But, when that happens, a little push or wiggle and it continues.

"Seemed like a long time to wait, but it wasn't. .  However, curlers were not considered an emergency need item.  Waiting was fine.  Certainly came as advertised and were a great buy...so worth the wait and I will continue to order these from this place.  I go thru a lot of these only because my dog has taken a fancy to them and is taking them right out of my hair as I sleep... I'm not sure, I keep them in a box on a high shelf...so what else is possible?  It's a mystery that baffles the ca'ca' out of moi'!  These curlers are just fantastic to sleep on...  So much easier, less time consuming, less damaging than using a curling iron.  Since they are so comfortable, I can leave in for sleeping w/o feeling the pain of normal curlers and I can even leave in the next day up until the time to get ready.  Sometimes I roll  my hair and the next day don't go anywhere, I can sleep a second night on these before being totally annoyed with being in curlers.  To me it is amazing that people will continue with the structured velcro curlers... they are just so uncomfortable.  These don't slip or slide any more than regular velcro curlers.  In fact, if you roll tight to allow for a bit of slackening, you're spot on.  Laying on these curlers does not affect the ""round"" curl effect... they don't get squashed flat... they somehow retain that ""round"" look quite well.  To get high lift, just as with any curler, raise hair straight up, then pull up and back away from part, then roll.  These are the large jumbo curlers which are perfect for wavy curls or smoothing out into a bob.  They make them smaller for more curly dos.

"These have to be the most comfortable shoes ever and I can't wait for Spring so I can wear them.  Wearing them in the house now. These  shoes come in different colors and sizes and the prices are all over the place.  The insoles can be popped right out.  They were totally finished off sew-wise so I can't imagine that wasn't planned as a feature.  I've never seen a shoe where the insoles were removable for washing.  And shoe and sole has a ""quality""  stitch/sew job.  I hate having dirty insoles.  Even  wearing socks, you are picking up dust and dirt which eventually soils your insole.

"I bought one of these on a stocking-stuffer Christmas-shopping run. I bought it at a home goods store.  When I got home, I had a jar on the counter of salsa that my husband could not previously open.  I'd merely set it aside to try again later.  I decided to use this before I put it in someone's stocking.  I was planning on using a lot of energy because of my previous experience trying to get it off.  I wasn't even thinking I could do it with this myself.  At the time I was hooking it on, I was yelling for my husband to come help me.  It came off so so amazingly easily that it was off before he came around the corner.  That shocked me...so I found another jar of pickles (this time) and tried it again, and off it came.  I've had jar openers, just not this design.  In fact, I was thinking when I bought it, it wasn't the ""best"" design.

"Came just in time for a lot of can opening... Worked great.... I had no problem whatsoever with these.  The only hiccup was the first larger can.  The opener stopped... Dragged out the directions and, sure enough, explained.  On larger cans, when it stops, you hit the button to get it to resume.  I love these things and getting two made the purchase a whole lot better.  I don't expect these to last my whole life...  And, at this price, they wouldn't need to.  Just a note.. you get two in separate packaging.  That means, if you intend to gift these.. you have two gifts.  Make a cute stocking stuffer for anyone, even a camper or traveler.  You're a little late...  but it would have been a great idea.  I would like to keep one in my vehicle for emergencies when traveling.

"These are great for the intended purpose.  I bought an extra one to use as a holder for my tiny handheld vacuum and it holds it just right.  I purchased a small handheld vacuum that had no holder.  I used one of these as a holder instead.  I put it on the side of a cabinet wall close to a plug in plate.  Works perfectly.  Works great on a hairdryer too.  In fact, I figured out that, if I put the wire in first and dangle it at the bottom, then reach that end toward a plug, it's even more handy.  My hair dryer tended to get the wire's stuck on cabinet door knobs and get hung up or dragged across the counter.  It was  annoying.  If I put the plug in first thru the bottom and then over to the plug,,. the height keeps it from dragging across my countertop and getting stuck in odd places.  I find that it's all one smooth as it keeps the cord from dripping down on to doorhandles or knobs.  My husband is going to order a couple to hold a couple of his tools out where he can reach for them quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O23AZNHBAIGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FS0EFLM#wasThisHelpful","R2O23AZNHBAIGY","A2LYT2QET2KC4N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LYT2QET2KC4N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love this toaster.  So much so, that when the first one we ordered didn't work right... I asked for a replacement and not my money back.  The second one I received works absolutely perfectly.  It's a gorgeous appliance... shiny and sleek... modern looking...high end look.  It's longer (duh) than a regular toaster, but not any wider.  It looks great sitting out on the counter along the wall.  I honestly hid the other toaster under the counter in a cabinet.  I don't feel the need to ""hide"" this one... maybe in a few weeks when the Honeymoon phase is gone.  This thing truly has the right amount of room for bagels and toast... and goes very fast.  You'll have to watch that and get used to the speed with which this appliance toasts.  If you have several people eating toast or having toasted sandwiches, this is going to be the best appliance for you.  I'm not kidding when I say it goes fast.  The electronics are not rocket science.  The instructions are clear...  I love the ""stop"" button...  That's great when you feel panic... get a look at your toast and decide whether to continue or not.  I haven't tried any other feature (got to read up on that defrost feature), but look forward to getting the most use out of this toaster.  I think this toaster is a great buy.  My best purchase of an appliance in quite a while.  Recommend you get it if you like toast, bagels... toasted  sandwiches....  I am returning the first one today that wouldn't work right...I was provided a label right away, and they sent out a replacement so fast it made my head spin!!  Stuff happens,  Amazon/Seller were perfectly attentive.  Wish I'd seen these earlier, great Christmas present to some families I know.  Definitely keeping in mind for my next wedding, hostess gift, or any excuse really. Imagine being proud to have given the ""toaster""....  UpDate... still loving this toaster.. great for buns when making hotdogs....  does a great job. on everything and comes in so handy when you have two boys (grandkids) eating you out of house and home...  Everyone who's visited has asked where did you get that toaster.... And, a wedding if finally coming up and I'm going to get my gift in early... and one of the things is going to be this toaster!

"I love this neck rest!  This fits great... I have a velcro extender which I put on here to give me more wearing options. I may make my own velcro extender.  It wouldn't be difficult. The Quality looks excellent  My little dog came up to me and I put it on him just to play with him.  How useful this thing could be.  It fit him perfectly.  No matter what kind of coat or sweater I buy him to keep him warm outside, there's always that upper chest where he often does not get the coverage from the elements that I truly want. I have to order larger sweaters to get them to fit around his fluffy tummy and the necks are all open practically down to his little legs.  He's only 25 pounds.  I put this on like a collar.  It covers the exposed chest and neck area around the sweater opening the collar... finally, outsmarted him. He can't get it or now his sweater off either...so he gets bored and moves on.  This will keep his chest and neck area warm.  He doesn't have an undercoat.  He comes back in during his middle of the night run and is absolutely freezing to death.  But no amount of explaining the benefit of a sweater gets thru to him.  This does that trick. and I can whip it right off of him.  Can't wait to try it on a long drive as my neck is the first thing to start aching.  Bet this will keep my neck in a more comfortable position.

"This runs about right to a little spacious.  Great to lounge in... to answer the door, to step outside for the dogs' to do their business... a run to the mail box... to take out the garbage.  This has got you covered.  I like the weight of the material.  It's not too hot to wear around the house.... Yet, my husband and I have set outside at night on the back porch to watch our little sweeties have some playtime in the yard and to chase a few balls and I was feeling comfy and warm.  The hood even came in handy as it was a little windy one night.  Now that it's colder I've thrown a sweater over it, and I'll pop up the hood to keep from being bothered by the wind.  I plan on getting a couple more of these for my lounging days and nights at home.  I also loved having this when I went to visit my sister and stayed over night.  Felt just fine among our relatives lounging around in this before bed time...  About the only bad thing I could say about it is that if you're really short, under 5'5"", you might find this a little long...  If you're a tall gal, you will find this lounger covers you to the floor nicely.  I especially love the zippered front...easy in and out without messing with your hair do.

"This little rolling over dog is cute...  Sometimes it takes more than a little movement to get it going, but both dogs seem to enjoy toying with it.  The little one is a little afraid of it, the larger dog not at all.  In fact, when the little one whines about it moving  and cackling, the larger dog runs right in an snaps it up and carries off to a far corner away from the little one.

"I am retired and stay home a lot.  I live in these type of lounging gowns.  What I particularly like about these are that they are front-zippered.  I like the fact that I can get ready to go somewhere, put on my makeup and do my hair and not have to pull the robe over my head; I also like that the sleeves are roomier that these pictures make them look...which makes it much easier to sit in a chair and twist and turn without dislocating a shoulder or ripping the gown, they are long enough to go to your feet  (but not an exaggerate length, I am 5'5"" and the colors are somewhat better than shown...to me.

"I had a 200 Watt Bulb in a back porch light that excluded me plugging anything else in on that circuit.  If I did, the fuse would blow.  And the 200 Watt Bulb would get very hot so we kept it on for very short periods of time; just enough time to allow the dog outside to do his business so we could see him, and then back in.  This was the least expensive of my options for CFL Bulb.  It is big, but it did fit my lamp, but just barely.  I don't think it's as bright as the regular bulb, but it's pretty darn close.  And now I don't have to worry about plugging something else in on that circuit because this is pulling less power.  So, I love it and I'm getting one for the front porch.

"I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest unbiased review.It was hard for me to tell from the picture,  how these earrings would look on my ears.  Now that I have them, I realize that the gold ball is behind my ear, but shows from the side.  I reversed the balls and put the while gold ball (which looks like faceted silver) on the back, but the yellow gold ball was to large for me to wear in the front.. of course that is just a matter of personal opinion, some may like the larger ball in front.The white gold faceted ball is very pretty ... it glimmers and looks like there might be some small diamonds on it...there aren't, it is the facets.  I love the look.The reason I gave these earrings 4 stars, is that the site says that they cost $172.72, which in my opinion makes they much too expensive for what they are.  I realize that they are gold, yellow and white, but no way do they look that expensive.  If I saw them in a store I would be willing to pay maybe $50 for them, certainly no more.The major thing that I like about them is that they the balls screw into each other, instead of being just regular posts that push through and can easily come off.  I have lost many posts this way.  These are very secure and will not come out of your ears as long as they are screwed in tight enough.They are comfortable and attractive and I will wear them, but again, I would never pay that much for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXT2WKP8LCNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7S5QE4#wasThisHelpful","RFXT2WKP8LCNO","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In advance I didn't realize that they would completely block the shelves below and I couldn't see the items on it, but this is my fault for not seeing it.  This is especially true for the shelf about the small drawer that holds, cheese, salami, yeast etc..The material is a bit 'fuzzy' and that sort of gives me the creeps when it is sitting on a shelf... don't ask why, I am just funny that way I guess.  The sheets are reversible, one side is a dark red and the other is lighter, white and red lines... which I much prefer over the solid red.I am not going to use them on the shelves themselves, only in the two vegetable drawers and the door shelves.  Only time will tell how well they hold up and I plan to follow the washing directions to a T.I do like that they have no adhesive backing, which of course makes it easier to add or remove.

"I received this product free of charge in return for an honest, unbiased review.I hate painting. Not so much the act itself, as the invariable disappointment in the final product. I fully understand that adequate effort must be invested in preparation, before the paint is applied. Unfortunately this knowledge doesnt seem to prevent the typically negative reaction to the end result, esp. after expending that time and attention.When this paint-system showed up, I had a specific job in mind for it. One that had been bothering me (and I had been avoiding) for years, in fact. And it wasnt exactly a backyard fence. The house shutters were painted professionally at the manufacturers facility many years ago to match my interior trim. Unfortunately, some sections of one shutters frame have begun to clearly show the woods grain pattern through the paint (shown, 1). Otherwise the paint coverage was adequate. I needed some way to spray my interior trims latex paint, and I decided this was it.I rationalized that my job was a good test case for a review since two functional capabilities would be critical:  o  The volume of paint in the spray would need to be controlled adequately to avoid runs in a small area.  o  A light volume application needs to be uniform enough in pattern, with decent atomization, allowing a minimum number of passes to, again, avoid runs.If the above criteria could be met, the wood grain that was gradually exposing itself could be hidden again.  o  AND, I wanted ease of set-up & clean-up - because, I hate painting, remember?Initially, the unit appears almost toy-like. But a closer look and some hands-on time reveal its design to be simple and robust rather than elegant. Its air supply motor seems to be a hand-held vacuum unit, utilizing its exhaust rather than intake end. One odd concern: several thickish strands of white plastic flash were sitting in one of the paint jars, and one decent-sized flat piece of blue plastic came rattling out of the air hose (both pieces shown, 2 & 3). Check your unit carefully for errant plastic bits before use.I became familiar with the various components, changed out the installed paint jet for the smaller size for my light volume requirement, adjusted the trigger/needle valve retraction for a minimum opening, popped open my original latex white trim paint can, thinned it way down, and shot some test sprays on cardboard, adjusted paint volume, thinned it more, tested some more and was set. This gun shoots a very big pattern, even with the smaller jet installed. But it *was* uniform, even when metering the paint way back. This looked promising.Since these surfaces were painted previously, I sanded them lightly for decent new paint adhesion. I had left the two bothersome horizontal frame pieces exposed and covered the large remaining area of shutter and tabletop with my newspaper drop-cloth (shown, 4) to catch all the overspray. It still wasnt enough.But the paint job worked! A handful of passes (read the instruction book to remind yourself how to move a sprayer correctly) and it looked great. The top section needed an additional two passes and was a bit thick, but very uniform and just took longer to dry. Even for my jobs small area, the paint density on the spray was light and uniform enough to succeed. The semi-gloss result is a bit lighter in shade than the faded surroundings, but the grain is gone and the ease with which this job was done, is making me considering doing the entire shutter assembly. (Final results shown, 5 - note that the phone-camera's flash exaggerates shade variance, which the eye can barley discern.)If this simple unit can be adjusted adequately to handle a fine/small scale job, its paint volume control and uniformity qualify as great in my opinion. Disassembly and clean up was a snap. It appears built to last.I love how this spray unit performed for my job. Time will tell if I ever come to love painting itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUU845X6A9PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AOH5TM#wasThisHelpful","R2IUU845X6A9PF","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free of charge in exchange for writing an honest unbiased review.First of all, it is impossible at this time to rate this flea control product which has only been on my dog for a short period of time.  Usually products like this take several months to properly evaluate.I gave it 5 stars based on ease of application and price and the fact that he had no reaction after I applied it.  It is very easy to apply, easier than Frontline.My dog does not have fleas and in 10 years I have only found one on him.  But... evidently they land on him and probably bite him and as he is highly allergic to flea saliva and he breaks out after being bitten.  Apparently Frontline, which we have used for years, is successful in killing them before they can lay eggs, but the saliva damage has already been done.  He can go for months having no breakouts or heavy scratching.Since I received three months supply of it,  I will use that time to judge it's performance. If the results are the same, I will definitely be purchasing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19EBAOU9JLF8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0L5WQW#wasThisHelpful","R19EBAOU9JLF8U","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.Main Pros: comfortable handle, safe tipMain Con: no pointy tipThe barrel/handle is very comfortable, and made me realize just how uncomfortable most standard utility, razor, and X-acto-type knives are.The blade tip, however, is rounded, which may occasionally prevent a small wound, but it also means you cant pierce anything to actually start a cut. Blister packs - no. Cutting a small gasket - no. It turns out, at the micro scale, piercing with a sharp tip is important. Making a knife safer is great. Taking away some its elemental functionality is not.When the blade is retracted, the nose piece rotates about 15 degrees, locking the blade in place, which is handy for transit. At least, I assume thats an intended feature, but its not mentioned anywhere in the product descriptions.The replaceable blade claim is practical, but there are no instructions on how-to do that - at least on the packing material. I wondered if further rotation of the nose piece would unlock something. I tried that, but felt I was at the breaking-point, force-wise, so I backed off. The manufacturers web site doesnt seem to have that info, either. Perhaps I am missing something obvious, but it wouldnt hurt to mention the procedure somewhere, perhaps at the product info blurb for the knife or the replacement blades (which at $19.99 for 4, you wouldnt want to waste). Plus, experimenting with physical force while holding a sharp tool, is rarely advisable.Returning to attempts at precise cuts.. a small metal blade flexes slightly, which can be a good thing when cutting a tight radius, and for corners, where precision counts. Ceramics, of course, are known more for shattering than flexing.Im sticking to X-actos for precision work, and cheap utility knives for cardboard boxes and crude garage work. Ceramics should be reserved for the kitchen - and high-performance brake rotors.I'll go 2 stars for overall comfort and the round tip for frequent Emergency Room visitors. I think this design is actually more harmful that beneficial.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JEVHOME83102/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9SSJE4#wasThisHelpful","R3JEVHOME83102","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest unbiased review.In a nutshell, the SoundTouch connected and performed exactly as I had hoped it would.Boses attention to sound reproduction accuracy, aesthetic detail and ease of setup makes this an excellent product for those with deep-ish pockets. My Apple equipment all paired with it flawlessly, and as advertised.  iTunes and Spotify played right along. I did not attempt to access a NAS device as a source. Connection flexibility is the units forte: direct to source via headphone/output cable, wireless to bluetooth enabled computer/device, wi-fid to your network. The only things missing are RCA and optical input jacks, but those require cables from another time and protocol-proposal entirely. The USB ports are for setup/configuration only, but also demonstrate a willingness to be reasonably inclusive.A combination of rich sound and borderline portability (my lab report says 19.6 lbs.) compel you to consider relocating the SoundTouch whenever you switch rooms - which I suppose bodes well for Boses grouping functionality, which is on offer with multiple units. Other than stereo separation, which is obviously limited due to the fixed width, this product is hard to fault. Ive always subscribed to the old stereophile adage: buy the heaviest speaker/amp you can afford. That seems to apply here.Music is clear and loud for the size of the drivers, though additional control of frequency ranges - beyond just bass - from the configuration application, would be a nice-to-have. I realize many players have equalizers, but an additional few adjustments at the music delivery point, to compensate for the acoustically variable environments the unit will find itself in, could add tailored convenience.Regarding the 6 channels/stations and the display: more presets would seem like an easy addition, since there is no actual downloading of a music library and therefore its memory requirements remain minimal. And for what may qualify as the most obscure problem in any review: the text presented on the units display should gently fade in and out when cycling. Each time a new description (track, artist, album, whatever) abruptly pops up on the bright, harsh, bluish-white on black display, it demands my eyes attention, if only for an instant. An admittedly minor, but irritating, distraction. Include a dimming option, perhaps?4.5 stars would probably be my preferred ranking. But I think I do love it. So, 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBHW9OMFZID3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IKGT46#wasThisHelpful","R3KBHW9OMFZID3","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item free of charge in return for an honest, unbiased review.All printing was done from iOS, using two different MacBook Airs (one on a 4.2Ghz wireless channel and another on a 5), an iPad and an iPhone. Everything worked properly, with seemingly no compromises. Copying from the front control panel also worked smoothly.Pros:- ease of setup; accurate, comprehensive instructions.- reliable wireless operation - via network or connected as a client to the printer.- printer/queue properly deleted a print job imm. before being printed - wow.- ink system superior to cartridges, with a smaller plastic/petroleum footprint.- copying allows enlarge/reduceCons:- color reproduction quality on photo paper- light construction, raises longevity as a question mark.Overall, configuring and using this printer, wirelessly, was almost too easy. It all worked exactly as advertised with not one hiccup from any device.It also held a particularly nice surprise. While testing, I realized I was about to print the wrong image.. and I was able to cancel the print job at the very last second. That has never worked for me. Ever. So far I havent wasted a single sheet of paper, which is unheard of when starting off with any printer Ive ever had.The ink wells are impressively sized, and should produce a serious volume of pages. For a small business, this printer type is a good alternative, provided the ink refilling procedure doesn't intimidate you. While the cartridge type printers are pretty much foolproof, this design, if only by virtue of avoiding a lifetimes worth of little plastic/petroleum cartridges, seems to be a better way to go. When filling the ink-wells, do use rubber gloves, and several layers of newspaper as a drop cloth - it saved my bacon.Utilizing the copying functionality from the front control panel (which would benefit from being a bit larger) was challenging at first. The minuscule display, and layout of the menu options requires some familiarization. But an enlarge/reduce function (yay!) more than makes up for an initial learning curve.Printout quality overall was good, but as a test, I compared the Epsons output to a veteran HP PhotoSmart 380 series, 4x6 printer, which is a small but specialized unit. I inserted a few sheets of HP 4 x 6 everyday photo paper, and selected the proper size on the laptops driver/printer configuration. The Epson paused at the print request, with the front panel alerting, and requesting selection of another paper size and type. All good so far. But the quality of the photo was not great. A section of the image with uniform color showed irregularities, making the original, smooth surface appear like snakeskin. Its as if the dyes fought one another and were unable to properly blend. Regular paper was better, but obviously lacked the pop of the photo-type.One other matter is the fact that it weighs very little and seems a bit thin in construction. So far, its worked fine, with the control panel and selection buttons proving solid enough - but I would be careful not to bang it around too much. In the past, Epson products in my world have had excellent reliability. If this one proves otherwise, I'll be back here.So while it doesnt do everything perfectly, the flexibility of the wireless printing access makes this a delightful printing treat for home. For the short-on-quality photo printing and small screen/interface, I remove one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4MUFQ9QHT4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JE56#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4MUFQ9QHT4O","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I am just baking, or reheating something small, sometimes I don't bother to use a small pan, I put the food directly on the foil and it is heavy enough to hold it when I lift it out of the oven.It's great for lining casserole dishes, broiler pans, wrapping things to freeze and so many other things.This 130 feet box is a good value too at the Amazon price of $8.72.Like other reviewers mentioned, my box arrived a little bit beat up on both ends.

"I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest non-biased review.A build quality failure occurred within the first few minutes of use.  When I attempted to release my iPad screen from the locked viewing position, a magnet detached itself from the holding frame.  Belkin's glue wasn't as strong as the magnet's pull.  You can avoid this by sliding the iPad in and out of position and not lifting it straight up.  But that is still a poor design.Although the case is nice looking and appears to be well made, personally, I find it to be rather heavy and with my iPad inserted, it is too heavy to carry in my purse or in a tote.A deal breaker as far as I am concerned, is that it does not go into sleep mode when the cover is closed.  Since most of us are used to this automatic function, it is easy to neglect shutting it off before closing the cover, and wasting the battery on the iPad itself.The attachment mechanism is OK, and does hold the tablet securely in place.The keyboard is easy to use and the keys have a nice spring to them. I found no fault with the keyboard itself and enjoyed using it.  If the battery itself does in fact stayed charged for six months, that alone would be worth ten stars.Some features are definitely worth 5 stars and others 1-3 stars, so I averaged out my review to 3 stars.Would I buy it .... definitely no as it lacks the automatic sleep system when the cover is closed.

Since they were sealed in plastic, I couldn't try them before I bought them.Boy was I wrong.  They are cheaply made and are VERY stiff and they bind occasionally.  In other words, they do not operate smoothly.  My husband put a bit of oil by the screw, but it didn't do much good.  They cut the yarn easily enough, but since they are new, I don't know how long the blades will stay sharp.I'll use them until they are dull and then toss them.  Lesson learned ... you get what you pay for and you can't blindly trust a brand name.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHJ36L73N8J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DECR8A#wasThisHelpful","REHJ36L73N8J7","AV3XTMK5I2AWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3XTMK5I2AWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest unbiased review.I have been using these bags for sometime now, and I am very impressed with the ease that they zip and unzip.  I use them for leftovers and occasionally to freeze food for short periods of time.  If they are in the freezer for  any length of time, they tend to get frost on the outside and occasionally on the food inside.I also carry snacks and my dog's cookies when I am the go.I find them to be invaluable when I travel.  I use them for cosmetics, medications, lotions, and other small objects.  They contain any leaks from gels or other liquid items. They keeps things organized and readily available in my luggage, especially in my carryon wheelies and my tote.

"I really have to wonder why the souls who toil away in back offices at publishing houses are so relentlessly prone to exaggeration. The descriptive paragraph meant to lure one to read this novel contains every single possible bit of hyperbole: ""wickedly funny"", ""totally engaging"", ""richly observed"", ""wildly colorful"", ""flamboyant"" and more. For heaven's sake, enough! It's as if the description was written by a used-car salesman trying to unload a beater.I opted to read/review this novel in spite of the excess of stock comments. And I'm happy that I made the choice. This is one of the rare books from which I hated to be separated. I carried it with me everywhere, and resented all the driving I have to do as a matter of course, because it was time I'd have preferred to be spending with Annie McDee, her alcoholic mother, and the unexpectedly resourceful Jesse.I loved following Annie's thoughts as she creates meals that include not only food but the appropriate settings in which it has to be served. For me, this was high art, just as much as the paintings described throughout the book. I also loved the delightful whimsy of the titular painting having a ""voice"" of its own.There is so much to enjoy in this novel. It's one of the rare times when I truly wished I knew the author, so I could ring her up and tell her which parts I found particularly affecting, and congratulate her on a splendid piece of writing.This book deserves to top the lists! Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R408V49FGE6OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874147#wasThisHelpful","R408V49FGE6OI","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, Brit for Women has a strong similarity to Thierry Mugler's Alien Aqua Chic. But, happily, Brit lacks the rather harsh edge of Alien. It is an altogether softer fragrance, subtle and exotic.

"For the most part, I like Lynch's films, and I had hoped this book would offer some particular insights into the man. But this slim volume is such a dry, rather pedantic treatise, that I found it difficult to stick with it. It takes more than a way with words to create a biography that offers a genuinely revealing view of the subject. It takes heart and a level of caring commitment that is lacking here. Rather than a stirring interior look at the man behind the movies, the book feels more like the printed record of a lecture given to a roomful of barely awake students.

"This is a book that wants to be a lot of things but merely winds up being superficial on all fronts.There is an extraordinary hand-noted piece of music found in Rome that goes home with Julia, the violinist heroine, to Boston. From the moment she first plays the found waltz in the presence of her 3-year-old daughter, things go terribly wrong--in every conceivable way in this flabby narrative.Every aspect of this book feels timeworn, like parts of several novels written before, and more convincingly, by other authors. There's nothing at all fresh; the characters are wooden and predictable, and there is a lack of true emotion to situations that demand a depth of feeling in order to be meaningful to the reader.Taking on the effects of the holocaust on the Italian characters in the shared story line borders on the offensive to anyone with some genuine knowledge of this horrific segment of world history. The author rides along on auto-pilot, never digging down far enough--again-- to bring a true depth of feeling to the situations and characters she describes. This is a painful, even irritating, example of biting off way more than one can chew.There is so much wrong with this book that when I got to the aha! moment of the plot, I actually almost laughed. Sadly, this is the kitchen-sink style of writing: throw everything into the pot and hope it turns into a tasty stew. It doesn't. It's a slapdash effort that might have been a good tale if the author had dived far more deeply into the stories (there are two narrative lines) and felt the pain of her characters, rather than simply talking about it.This is a fail.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJY8UT2JTOLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884347#wasThisHelpful","R2NJY8UT2JTOLV","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this system is HEAVY. The UPS driver had to bring it inside for me. I couldn't pick it up. Then, once inside, a lot of effort was required to unbox it. I imagined I would be receiving a smaller, more compact unit. But okay. It's Bose. It has to be great. Right???But this is not as simple as the tech-savvy reviewers would have you believe. I've only dealt previously with small, compact speakers. This required some downloading--first the app for my iMac and then the one for my iPhone. The set-up might have been easier if I'd started with the iPhone but since I wouldn't often be sending music from the phone to the Bose, it made sense to set up the computer first.So okay. First the download from the product page, followed by the installation of the app. Then some steps to get it up and running. Once comprehension kicked in, it wasn't all that hard to make the Bluetooth connection, then ""mate"" with iTunes and play my music. However, today when I wanted to play music (part of my review process) I found that the machine was connected to my iPhone but not the computer. In order to play from the iMac, it was necessary to select the AUX button, then open the SoundTouch app and iTunes and set everything up again.I had similar difficulties with playback from the iPhone. The remote does work but what surprised me was that once powered on, what came on was one of the NPR stations I had preset. I had to select my choice of playback manually.So ... if you're reasonably good at hooking things up (I am, but this one was/is a doozy!) it's likely you're going to have some of the same problems I've had. I'm about to call Bose for tech support. Even though I followed all the instructions I still have a lot of issues.On the plus side, the sound is great, nicely balanced with rich tones. I just wish it were a little less complicated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMA0KDYKN2V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IKGT46#wasThisHelpful","R3OMA0KDYKN2V2","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is most parents' worst nightmare: you put your toddler to bed in her crib and come the morning she is gone.

"This is a delightful novel, with research so seamlessly enmeshed in the prose that the reader is easily taken back in time and place. I didn't find it "" ... romping and hilarious"" as author Elizabeth Gilbert did, according to her cover quote. Romping? Hilarious? Come on. This is a rather gently told reimagining of a true story about the many and varied ""collisions"" between the louche factory owner Henry Kaufman and his thuggish cohorts and the redoubtable Constance Kopp and her sisters.My only problem with the book is the depiction of the youngest sister, Fleurette. Her behavior is more appropriate to someone much younger than 17. And while I can understand that the girl has been shaped by isolation, it's still a bit annoying in contemporary terms. But this is a small quibble, really, and doesn't negatively affect this enormously readable and charming tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FTOEQLIEZNPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R2FTOEQLIEZNPI","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The major minus: This stroller is h-e-a-v-y. As a grandmother (of somewhat advanced years) I can't imagine how I could possibly fold this up and get it into the trunk of my car. I suppose I was spoiled by the Maclaren strollers both my daughter and I used; various models over time weighing in at under 12 pounds.That said, what attracted me most to this stroller was the ability to have the primary seat facing backwards (instead of forwards) so that the baby could see who was pushing the stroller. Strollers used to be made that way as a matter of course, but in recent times they all seem to have forward-facing seats. I think little ones like the reassurance of being able to see who's up front, at the controls (so to speak.)I like the multi-positional reclining aspect of the seat and the large UPF-50 sun (or rain) canopy. I also very much like the idea of the second seat being included. It wipes out the need to purchase a new stroller when another baby comes along.Altogether, this is a solid, sturdy item and I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188W8E800I4YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0DCTVU#wasThisHelpful","R188W8E800I4YA","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I didn't expect when I opted to review this book was the good-natured, big-hearted narrative by author and former Alice Cooper band member Dunaway. In spite of the classic trials and tribulations common to so many rock bands - regardless of their uniqueness - Dunaway's telling of the trajectory of the band is never mean-spirited or bitter.There's a great aspect of fun and discovery to how the band came to be a great success, with its outrageous costumes, long long hair, and theatrical performances that accompanied the music. Where the misery creeps in has to do with the terrible effects of alcoholism combined with ego. Trying to hold a band together when two of its members are getting lost in an increasingly drunken fog is like trying to juggle mercury. Impossible. It falls apart, goes rolling off in every direction. Beautiful and sad.Thanks to Dunaway's unfailing grace, the book doesn't descend into ugly recriminations or horrifying revelations. It's a well-told tale that covers the delicious pleasure of working diligently toward a success that comes and then, too quickly, goes.Well worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NYDXHP4OJKJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250048087#wasThisHelpful","R1NYDXHP4OJKJ0","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After recently reading a number of books that have me deeply concerned about the current state of publishing, along comes The Border and restores my faith. McCammon is a writer who understands that good writing doesn't require gimmicks. This an engaging, heartfelt effort, with entirely believable characters. And the images of devastation, and the morphing, flesh-eating aliens battling overhead in bursts of red and blue lights are very vivid.Everyone comes fully to life and we are taken along on interior and exterior journeys through the ruined landscape and the damaged hearts and minds of the small group of survivors, following young Ethan as he searches for answers.What I particuarly liked -- and this may simply be a case of my personal extrapolation -- is McCammon's depiction of the warring aliens as unspeakably grotesque and emotionless killing machines. This is a viable metaphor that could apply to all aggressors: there is nothing attractive about entities who destroy everything in their paths. Much of today's world is struggling to live with creatures like this. It's a cautionary note to which we need to pay attention.I wondered how this tale would be resolved, and greatly admire the clever yet profoundly simple solution McCammon provides. This is an enormously entertaining and thought-provoking novel.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KK8JHI99659X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067039#wasThisHelpful","R1KK8JHI99659X","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I quite like period pieces--as long as they're well done and faithful to the era. This time out it just doesn't happen.Aside from being so predictable that it felt as if I'd read this book several times before, there are so many words, phrases, expressions that are contemporary that there's very little sense of events that happened 60 years ago. It's not only the author's fault, it's also the fault of the editor and the proof-reader (if they even exist anymore.) I'm willing to forgive one or two anachronisms, but when I start taking notes of the ones I find, what we have here is a book in trouble.Here are just a few:Referring to military men as ""doughboys."" Well, no. By WWII, they were called GIs.Supercop??? Get outta here. No way.Psycho killer? Not, at the very least, until after 1960 when Hitchcock made his creepy masterpiece.Peanut gallery. Yeah, okay. A vaudevillian term referring to people who sat in the cheap seats but popularized by the Howdy Doody Show which didn't go on the air until 1947 -- two years after the war ended.On and on and on.I disliked the characters. Again, it seemed I'd read about these same people in half a dozen other books. Stock characters, behaving in stock fashion.So, no. Give this one a pass.

"This is a nice little machine, with a good long cord. It works well on wood floors, isn't great for carpets but did a decent job on my carpeted stairs. I don't have a ceiling fan and actually use an extendable duster to reach the higher areas/corners of my home. But for a quick go-round, it's a decent, not-too-heavy cleaner. I like the bagless aspect (our previous Dirt Devil took bags and when the machine died - fairly early on in its short life - we were left with a lot of bags.] Overall, it's okay.

"According to my daughter (who, along with my granddaughter, was one of the test subjects) this is a quality product. But its narrow width makes working on her long (below the shoulders) very thick hair, time-consuming. It worked more efficiently on my granddaughter's long, moderately thick hair. But it took a while for both of them. The vibration was a plus - ""That tells me it's working"" - as was the fact that it doesn't catch (or pull) the hair.

"This is a book that wants to be so many things that it winds up being nothing much at all. It's got a cast of headless chickens all running madly about, brimming with emotions and overspilling tears. (Impossible to care about these chickens!) We've got marital infidelity; bullying (a deeply serious topic ineptly done); autism (which comes across as serious mental impairment, not remotely like autism - or even on the spectrum).

"The first surprise was opening the package to discover this item folded flat. Not what I expected, given the product page photograph. The second surprise was the very nice feel of the bin. And the third surprise was how incredibly well made it was. I'm a lifelong knitter and have a great appreciation for quality stitchwork. This piece is flawless. It's also washable - another bonus. And, finally, it was made in Vietnam, NOT in China. It's beyond difficult to find anything not made in China these days. So when an attractive, quality item shows up, I'm simply delighted.This bin will hold the small containers that are used for my grandchildren's school lunches.

"Here's a book that takes off like a rocket. Taut, lean writing. Lots going on. Interesting premise, although it kept making me think of Person of Interest (the TV series.) There are quite a few similarities to that show, and the book ultimately just wasn't strong enough to keep my attention from repeatedly going back to it.There was a bit of a stock feeling to this book and its characters. And that's okay because it's a genre that calls for prototypical types. What elevates a thriller is what the author does with those types. This time out, everything holds together for a good half of the book. And then ... it rushes toward an ending that feels as if dinner was waiting, or a dental appointment. Gotta get this done and get outta here.Too bad, because the premise was intriguing. But unlike Lee Child, whose Reacher sometimes suffers injuries, Lee's Dryden is a superman - knocking off the bad guys in quantum numbers without sustaining even a scratch. Nah!

"The author has done a commendable job in creating an authentic-feeling diary, with meticulous research that doesn't in the least feel like research (which is exceedingly difficult to do). Rosette climbs off the page and stubbornly keeps hold of the reader's attention throughout a novel that brings to life the Civil War and a young bride's determination not to be left behind when her husband leaves her only days after their wedding to go off to war. Rosetta and Jeremiah are of a time and place when young people were engaged in actually living life, going to war for the stipend that would allow them to fulfill their dream of a farm out west. I suspect these characters would be horrified by the current reality of people their age welded to expensive cell phones, addicted to their invariably trivial text messages. Author McCabe succeeds in taking the reader back into a very different world, a time when the things that mattered (war notwithstanding) had considerably more heft than the current urgency of unanswered text messages. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ZH2TOWZS2SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137722#wasThisHelpful","R39ZH2TOWZS2SF","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having read all the Tales of the City books, I was looking forward to the finale. Sadly, The Days of Anna Madrigal just doesn't deliver. Anna is 92 and the book reads as if it's ancient, too. It's a tired effort, lacking energy and lacking, too, the heft of a major effort to go beyond a kind of superficial, automatic writing. There's nothing particularly profound or touching, just a creaky narrative recitation that wants to be meaningful but lacks that above-mentioned effort and energy to take it to a deeper place.

"I saw this film a number of times in my childhood and loved it. It was a favorite back then, primarily because of the two little boys who were so very different from the children I usually saw in movies. [The only child actor who made a similar impact on me back then was Brandon deWilde in Shane and Good-bye, My Lady.] I recently watched this film again and was delighted at how well it has stood the test of time.

"I've been reading Martin Cruz Smith since the Romano Grey ""Gypsy"" series back in the early 70s. He has always been a writer to enjoy and admire. While Tatiana is a more slowly paced book than some previous ones, I found its pacing appropriate to the advancing age of Arkady Renko. The investigator has been around for a while now; he's taken a bunch of beatings but he is still a relentless, unstoppable pursuer of truth. Tatiana offers entertainment in its truest sense: it provides puzzles, crazy villains, and an always scary view of the Russian political and criminal climate.Ignore the complainers who posted negative reviews because they're disappointed that the author isn't writing the same book over and over again. This is quality prose with gentle touches of humor and wisdom. Even the most minor characters are fully fleshed and believable. And Arkady rolls with the punches, still standing at the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK3A7S6QFDTMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439140219#wasThisHelpful","RK3A7S6QFDTMF","A29IYGR7SNPRIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29IYGR7SNPRIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book took me over so completely that I was fairly bereft when it ended. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I finished it. In particular I was deeply impressed by the author's delicacy and skill in handling multiple characters--strands of yearning and violence woven into a cohesive fabric without undue graphics that would have detracted from the narrative. There are moments of sudden warmth and moments of matter-of-fact betrayal: people simply being themselves without thinking too deeply about why they're doing the things they do. And there is an ending that is immensely gratifying; absolutely perfect in its rightness for the characters the author has brought to life. Rarely have I read anything to equal The Purchase.

"When it comes to testing speakers, I like to begin by saying I am not an audiophile.  What I like is a good sounding speaker that is easy to use.I opened the Nyne TT Bluetooth speaker and saw that it came with a medium quality carrying case and a power supply with a handful of connectors that I could see are for use in various countries.  I found the connector for the United States and attached it to the power supply and charged the unit.Like most guys probably do, I did not read the directions.  It took me a few tries to figure out that to turn the unit on and off, I just had to quickly hit the power button.  I was trying to hold the button in like I have to do on another brand of Bluetooth speaker and the unit would not turn on.One thing I really like about this brand is that there are volume controls right on the speaker itself.  I really like this as I usually play music through my iPad.  I do not carry my iPad with me, I usually only carry the speaker and leave the iPad in one place as I move from room to room.  My favorite speaker does not have volume controls on the speaker itself, which forces me to find my iPad every time the phone rings or someone walks up to speak with me.  The volume button on the speaker makes it much easier to turn down the music without searching for my iPad.I would rate the sound out of this speaker to be very good.  The speaker does all ranges very well with the exception of very low bass.  I use the song Ruby Tuesday by The Rolling Stones to test a speakers capability to handle bass due to the low, double bass they use in the song.  The speaker did excellent with the exception of the lowest of the bass in the song.The only drawback with the sound of the speaker is that it does have a hiss in the background, that very much reminds me of an old TV when you flipped to a non-existent channel where the white and black things are dancing across the screen.  The sound is there when you play music if you listen closely.  My solution is to just turn the music up louder until I cannot hear it anymore.The loudest volume of the speaker is not the loudest I have had out of a Bluetooth speaker, but it is pretty loud.Overall, I am quite pleased with this speaker.  It is not my favorite Bluetooth speaker I own, but it is a very close second (and I mean very close).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DA3XKU032XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9ID070#wasThisHelpful","R8DA3XKU032XP","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:45 Mins Let me begin by saying I am not an audiophile.  I like something that is easy to use and gives good sound quality without a ton of effort.  I reviewed the speaker with this in mind.The Nyne Aqua is the 4th Bluetooth speaker I have owned.  This is one of those few times where I think the product is good and mediocre at the same time.I like to play music through my iPad via Bluetooth speakers.  Without even opening the directions, I was able to quickly and easily pair the speaker with my iPad.  One thing I really liked about this speaker was that it has volume controls on the speaker itself.  Sometimes, I will set my iPad in one place and only bring the speaker with me.  I like my music loud.  My favorite speaker (SOL REPUBLIC Deck Ultra) has no volume controls on the speaker itself and if my kids or someone tries to talk to me, I have to either power off the speaker or find my iPad and turn the volume down there.  I really like the volume controls being right on the speaker so I can turn it down when I need to in a hurry.The loudest output of the speaker is good, but it is not enough to completely ""blow me away"".  It is loud, but for me, it was not loud enough to really impress me.When the speaker is used in a dry environment, the sound is good to great.  The high end of the speaker sounds great in my opinion.  There is a constant, low volume hiss in the speaker when you put your ear up close when nothing is playing, but nothing that really distracts from the music.Where I am dissatisfied in most portable speakers is with the bass.  When it came to the bass, I would say this speaker is better than average, but was not great.  When I played ""Another One Bites The Dust"" by Queen, the bass guitar solo really comes through nicely.  However, when I played Ruby Tuesday by The Rolling Stones, this is where the speaker fell short.  The speaker cut out the low end of the double bass in the song.  I could still hear the double bass distinctly though, which is a huge improvement over most of my other speakers and sound output devices I have used.Where I really think the speaker fell flat was the sound when the speaker was being used in a wet environment.  The speaker floats as advertized.  I was able to submerge the speaker and spray it for several minutes with the shower head and the speaker continued working.  However, with even the smallest splash of water over the speaker, the sound gets terribly distorted and muffled.  If the speaker portion is kept dry, then the sound remains decent and clear.Personally, I would give the speaker of 4 stars when dry and 2 stars when wet.  This is my first waterproof speaker I have tried in a wet environment.  Perhaps this is the best ""wet"" use speaker on the market, but I was just not impressed with the sound of the speaker when it got wet like I might expect it would be in a pool with kids or a hot tub full of drunks.  Averaging the ratings, I will give the speaker 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRLYQ5P4EFC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH1AFFY#wasThisHelpful","R3MRLYQ5P4EFC1","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having had a toy accidently thrown through the screen of my Samsung Plasma TV, I had gone out and bought an LG 50LB5900 LED TV.  While I really liked the video aspects of the TV, the factory speakers were terrible.  Despite the TV being only across the room, I would constantly have to have the TV volume turned up to the 70s to 90s out of 100 to be able to hear the TV.  I then opted to purchase the LG NB4543 sound bar.  I chose this product simply because it was the same brand as the TV and it was on sale at the time I needed it.Installation of the sound bar was quite easy.  The sound bar has HDMI, USB, optical, and a portable device interface (looks similar to a headphone jack, not sure of the size though).  Personally, I connected the bar to the TV via the optical port.  Upon powering up the subwoofer, the wireless subwoofer immediately synced with the sound bar.  I then set up the TV up to work with the sound bar and the sound bar and TV worked flawlessly together.Personally, I found the sound quality from the sound bar to be good to great, but not quite excellent.  The bass put out by wireless subwoofer is great to excellent.  I have the base turned up high and I honestly love the rumbling sound the subwoofer puts out during something like an artillery attack in a movie.I also think the high end on the sound bar is great.  The sounds on the high end come through clearly with great tone and volume.Where I think this speaker is lacking is in the midrange.  The bass is good and the treble is good, but there seems to be nothing in between.  While the system does not sound bad, the output at times feels like it lacks depth and is thin.Despite my perception that the midrange output is lacking with this sound bar, I am still happy with my purchase.  The output of the sound bar is 10 times better than the factory TV speakers.  I personally think this is a solid product and I am happy with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFZ4Y1XN087S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYW40FA#wasThisHelpful","RBFZ4Y1XN087S","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book caught my eye as I toyed with the idea of being in the medical profession once upon a time.  Rather than applying to med schools, I opted to take my Engineering degree and start my professional career.  As with many decisions in life, I kind of wondered what I missed by going the Engineering route instead of the medical field.  This book appealed to me as it documented a doctors first year internship at a hospital and I thought it might give me a taste of what might have been.The book is the memoir of Matt McCarthy a Harvard Medical student. The book documents Mr. McCarthys first year as a medical intern, first a brief stint as a surgeon in a Manhattan Hospital and then a bulk of the time spent rotating in Columbia University Medical Center.I did find the book a bit choppy to read as the author jumped from one rotation to the next.  The author told the stories of patients he interacted with and told them very well.  He did an excellent job detailing the personal highs and lows of the first year in his noble profession.  In a way, the book reads like a great soap opera, all the elements are there:  suspense, tragedy, self doubt, triumphs, love and caring for others, and personal growth.  While I did find the flow to be a bit off in my opinion, the stories told are great.  The book kept my attention and I was always anxious to turn the page to see how the current sub-plot would end.All in all, I really enjoyed this book.  As I mentioned, I had an interest in medicine and this really gave me a glimpse of what could have been for me.  I will say becoming a skilled doctor certainly appears to be a long, hard road filled with self-sacrifice.  If this is a subject of interest, I would highly recommend the book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BZ03DHV5PF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138656#wasThisHelpful","R22BZ03DHV5PF1","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally, Gatorade has always been my go to product for rehydration after lengthy, strenuous exercise.  It is relatively cheap, it tastes good, it seems to get the job done, and I can drink it fast without upsetting my stomach.  I had never tried an EAS Hydrate product yet and thought I would give it a try to see how it was.I tried the product several times and I honestly did not care for the flavor.  The smell of the product once mixed is a pleasant orange smell which reminds me of Tang, though not as strong smelling.  When I take a drink, the first taste that hits me is the taste of salts.  That is quickly followed by a chemically orange flavor that I did not find pleasing.  Again, quickly following the orange was a subtle sweetness.  The finish of the flavor is this kind of pleasant sweet and saltiness on the tongue.I did not find the overall flavor of this product pleasing.  Kind of like a flat beer, it just seems that something is missing when you taste it.I checked the nutrition profile of the EAS Hydrate Workout Supplement and see that 8 ounces has 25 calories with 270mg of sodium and 180mg of potassium.  The Lemon-Lime Gatorade has about 53 calories with about 107mg of sodium and about 30mg of potassium.EAS Hydrate has almost 3 times the sodium and 6 times the potassium of Gatorade with half the calories.  Is this a good thing?  I am not sure, but my thought process is this.  If I am exercising to the point where I am worrying about my sodium and potassium levels that much, then I probably want to try to do whatever I can to be getting calories for fuel in my system as well.  I think I would be willing to sacrifice some electrolytes to gain some extra calories.I am really hoping to earn the trifecta in the Spartan Race series this year.  I found that I had problems drinking this product rapidly like if I were to drink at a water/fueling station.  There was just something about the flavor and/or composition of this particular product that just did not work for me and did not feel right in my stomach. I would not discourage anyone from trying this product to see if it works for them.  However, I personally plan on sticking with Gatorade.I also wanted to mention that I did drink several glasses of this prior to going to bed after drinking a lot of beer at a beer festival a few weeks back.  As I got older, I seem to be much more prone to hangovers.  However, I did wake up feeling great the next morning.  I will be trying this product again as a hangover preventative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BU6Y116E1OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9HQ5LM#wasThisHelpful","R15BU6Y116E1OP","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this wiper to put on the windshield of a 2002 Ford Explorer.  I usually use Anco 30-22 Winter Wiper Blades on my vehicles.  I put the Bosch 4922 on one side and left the 12 month old Anco 30-22 Winter Wiper on the other.Installation of the Bosch 4922 was a little different, but easy enough to figure out.  I had the hook type wiper arm and this requires flipping a piece molded into the wiper.  It required a little manipulation to get it out, but I was able to flip the part out and easily connect the wiper to the wiper arm.I used the Bosch 4922 wiper for about a month.  After a month, the Bosch wiper seems to clean the windshield quite well.  However, comparing the Bosch wiper side by side with a year old Anco Winter wiper, I really did not see a ton of difference.  The current price for the Bosch 4922 is about $19 per wiper and the current price for the Anco 30-22 winter wiper is about $9.50 per wiper.  Based on what I have seen thus far, I am not sure the Bosch 4922 is worth the extra money.  However, the Bosch 4922 wiper does work well and other than the significantly higher current price, I would have no issues recommending it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6U0Q8Z4RX30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ1E8#wasThisHelpful","R1J6U0Q8Z4RX30","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time using the Turbo Tax line of tax preparation software in over a decade.  I have been a loyal H&R Block software user for many years.  I thought I would give Turbo Tax a try after being away from it for a number of years.There is nothing really extra ordinary in the taxes I prepare.  My taxes mainly consist of work income, interest, dividend, and investment sales.  I have a mortgage and pay property taxes on several parcels of land.  I have a relative that lives in Alaska that I help with their taxes, so I do deal with the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend payout and retirement income there.Loading the software onto a PC was quite easy, though it did seem to take a bit of time to load.  I imported my H&R Block tax return into Turbo Tax without any issues at all.Updating last years information and entering new information into Turbo Tax was easy and for the most part uneventful. The only thing I really did not like with the Turbo Tax software was that it was not obvious where to enter the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend information for federal taxes where in the H&R Block software it was much more obvious.Comparing my experiences between H&R Block and Turbo Tax, I found both programs to be very similar and both to be very easy to use.  Personally, if I have to choose between the two, it would 100% come down to price.  For the 2014 software, I would need Turbo Tax Premium to deal with investment income or H&R Block Deluxe.  At the time of this review, H&R Block Deluxe is about half the price of Turbo Tax Premium.  While the Turbo Tax software does the job just fine, it really seems to be a poor value for the money.  H&R Block Deluxe is a very similar product, does just as good of a job, and the cost is half as much.Unless you have a strong attachment to Turbo Tax for some reason, I would recommend passing on this product and picking up H&R Block software.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GPIO8T7RUEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYXTCNC#wasThisHelpful","R21GPIO8T7RUEL","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always misplacing my kitchen thermometers.  As such, I am always in the market for a new one.  Seeing this item interfaced with a smart device, I thought it would be neat to try.I unboxed the unit and it basically consists of the thermometer unit and a metal probe.  The thermometer unit is about the size of a doctors stethoscope.  The probe plugs into the thermometer unit and the cable measured in at 4 feet.I opened the provided quick start guide and I personally found the quick start guide very lacking in directions.  Once I knew how to operate the thermometer, the quick start guide made sense.  However, I personally needed to go to the companys website and download the full user manual, which can be found at  http://idevicesinc.com/kitchen-thermometer/downloads/KTmini-user-manual.pdfThe full user manual lists the following devices as compatible with the thermometer (the quick start guide makes no mention of the supported hardware platforms that I see):-iPhone (4S and later)- iPad (3rd generation and later)- iPad mini (all generations)- iPod touch (5th generation and later)-many Android devices equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and running Android software version 4.3 or laterAfter a failed attempt to use an iPad 2nd generation (as the quick start guide did not specify what I could use with this product), I loaded the app onto an iPad mini.  I found the app to actually be quite user friendly and very intuitive to use.  Referencing the full user manual mentioned above, I was able to connect the thermometer to my iPad via Bluetooth and was able to start measuring temperature.After using this thermometer, I will say what I would not recommend it for.  If you are looking for something to use as an instant read thermometer, I would look elsewhere.  While this will work just fine to check the temperature of that hamburger patty in the frying pan, it takes too much time to set up and there are much more convenient alternatives out there.What this unit does excel at is measuring the temperature of anything that take some time to cook.  If you are heating water to a certain temperature to make homemade beer, smoking meat, or making a turkey in the oven, I think this is an excellent unit.  The app plots the temperature at the probe over time, so you can tell how fast the food item is heating up and tell if it is maintain temperature and make heating adjustments accordingly.Once I got past learning how to connect the thermometer to my iPad mini, I really liked the device.  Again, I would not use this to quickly check the temperature of something, but is awesome for monitoring longer cooking items.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FHRMOC7ZDBT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGDGR26#wasThisHelpful","R2FHRMOC7ZDBT6","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had one of the old style versions of the Foreman Grill in the late 1990s.  While I was not watching my fat intake at that point of my life, I did like the small, compact design and how it cooked from both sides.  I recall using it quite a bit for cooking preformed, frozen hamburger patties.  These patties always seemed to consist of high fat meat and the Foreman Grill was awesome for cooking these easily and quickly when I worked nights.  While I do not recall what happened to my first grill, I do recall that I did not like cleaning the grill as the plates were not removable and I recall that there were no controls whatsoever.  I was quite interested to see how 10+ years has changed the concept of the Foreman Grill.This version of the Foreman Grill is much bigger, measuring roughly 15x12x6 inches.  The cooking surface will very easily fit 2 large meat patties or two slices of bread/sandwiches.  The grill is designed so that it can be used as a flat cooking surface or tilted so that the fats and juices run off into a collection reservoir.There are three huge improvements over the original model.  The first is removable plates.  Rather than having to try and clean the surface of the grill with the cooking surfaces attached, the plates can easily be removed and cleaned in the sink.  The second is digital controls.  The grill controls have temperature adjustments and has a built in timer.  The third is the sear option.  I think the short, high heat initial cooking option adds excellent flavors to meatsI played around with the grill and cooked several items.  From powering the grill on to the 300F mark is a 5 minute wait time.  From 300F to the 500F sear heat is an additional 5 minutes (or about 9.5 minutes from cold to 500F).  The grill comes with an instruction book that gives you an idea of times to cook various items as well as having cooking guidelines on the front surface of the upper portion of the grill.  I really love the sear option.  I have been using this a lot with fresh hamburgers.  The sear option perfectly seals and slightly caramelizes the meat resulting in an excellent burger.  I also played around with making grilled cheese sandwiches with the grill.  This took a little practice.  There was a very small window between getting a perfect grilled cheese and two slices of toasted bread with all the cheese squished out.Another thing worth mentioning is that the cooking plates are now ceramic coated instead of Teflon type.  However, the waffle plates appear to be the traditional Teflon type cooking surface.  The ceramic plates do clean up quite easily.Overall, I am quite happy with this Foreman Grill.  If this type of appliance is something if interest, I would highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4WNKNAI872J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJWE8#wasThisHelpful","R1X4WNKNAI872J","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always wanted to find a reliable, small, remote control flier of some sort.  I have tried a few RC helicopters, but managed to break then in record time.  I thought I would give the Parrot MiniDrone Rolling Spider a try.Unboxing the unit, I was initially impressed.  The unit is fairly small, about 3/4th the size of my hand and about two fingers high.  The flier is a basic quadricopter design and has no guards around the propellers.  The propellers are a thin plastic material while the chassis is what appears to be a thicker, much stronger plastic construction.I downloaded the Free Flight 3 app onto an Apple iPad Mini and attempted to fly.  While the quick start guide will get you up and running, it is virtually of no help after that.  I had never used this app before and could not figure out how to fly the thing to save my life.  Thankfully, after reading a few reviews here on Amazon, I found someone pointed to the user guide at the URL:  http://parrotcontact.emencia.net/website/user-guides/download-user-guides.php?pdf=rolling-spider/Rolling-spider_User-guide_UK.pdfAfter downloading the User Guide, I was able to get an idea of how to fly the thing, use the acrobatic tricks, and take some photographs.Personally, I have not used the wheels.  Using the wheels obviously adds weight and cuts down on the already short flight time.  In a place without winds such as in a building, the Rolling Spider is incredibly stable and easy to fly.  Flight is accomplished by tilting your iPad or smart device in the direction of desired travel.  The app is loosely a joystick and button design.  The left joystick controls altitude and rotates the drone on the XY plane (left or right).  The right button is used to activate motion in the drone as well as trigger a few acrobatic tricks.  The acrobatic tricks are mainly 360 rolls in the forward, backward, left, and right directions.Flying the unit outside is a bit more challenging with the winds involved.  While the Rolling Spider does remain stable, the winds will push it around and requires the user to compensate with the controller if attempting to keep the drone in a certain area.The Rolling Parrot is equipped with a camera.  I found the images it takes tend to have a washed out color and appear grainy.  When you take a picture, the image is not sent back to the controlling device.  Rather, you have to connect the drone to a PC and download them, much like you would with a SD card from a digital camera.The battery does not have a very long life.  On a charge, you will get about 8 minutes of flight without the wheels.  I have been charging the unit via the USB port on my PC and it required approximately 60 to 90 minutes to get a full charge.In my month of usage, I have crashed the Rolling Parrot numerous times.  For the most part, the unit has come away unscathed.  It seems that occasionally a crash might push on a propeller and tightens the propeller down and I am guessing causes that particular propeller to turn slower.  This resulted in the unit moving in one direction very rapidly and crashing.  Usually the 2nd crash fixes the propeller issue.  At another point, my unit did quit charging and would not turn on.  I fixed this easily by reseating the battery.  Nothing has broken on the unit this far.  I have had a propeller fall off, but they are easily pushed back on.Overall, the unit is fun and easy to fly once you learn the basics.  However, I found the included documentation to be poor at best.  There is nothing on the app that teaches you how to use the various options on the app.  Also, the flight versus charge time is approximately 1 minute of flight to every 7 minutes of charging.  Personally, I think the company could have done a little better than this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18U32I2ROFIEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZM53NC#wasThisHelpful","R18U32I2ROFIEP","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the longest time, I felt a flashlight was a flashlight.  Honestly, whenever I needed one, I would just buy the cheapest one available.  The only exception to this was a 3 D cell Maglight I used to carry with me when I worked overseas and that had more to do with being able to use the flashlight as a weapon in a bind more than the light quality.  I have to say I was curious what might make the Goal Zero 250 worth the current asking price of $80.The Goal Zero Portable Torch 250 weighs in at 15 ounces and measures about 10 inches x 3.125 inches x 1.5 inches at the widest points.  The cross section of the flashlight is trapezoidal rather than the traditional round shape.The flashlight does not have replaceable batteries like one might expect on a flashlight.  The unit is charged via solar, hand crank dynamo, or via a USB cable.  The solar seems to be painfully slow and the handcrank seems to only provide minimal power for use in an emergency and the batteries are drained.  One of the great things about this flashlight is that the USB cable to charge the unit is permanently fixed to the flashlight housing so there is no cable to look for when it needs to be charged.The flashlight itself has 3 lighting options, a white spotlight, a red spotlight, and a white flood light.  Both white lights have a high and a low setting and the red LEDs have steady and flashing settings.  I do have to say the lighting aspects of the flashlight are outstanding.  The spotlight is bright and nicely focused.  At about 200 feet, I would estimate the illuminated area is only about 15 feet across.The floodlight is very good for illuminating a much larger area and I also think it does an excellent job.  I was recently using the flood light to evaluate a landscaping project in the dark and was able assess the work I needed to do in the morning.I personally have not used the red LEDs a great deal.  They seem to illuminate enough to see where you are going in the dark or read something close up in the dark.The flashlight also has a USB port to use to charge an external device.  I tested this and I was able to charge several devices off of the USB port.Honestly, I have to say that this has become my favorite flashlight.  I like the ability to charge via solar and the fact it has a hand crank dynamo in the event of an emergency or a sustained power outage.  I also like the fact that the unit can be used to charge electronics if I am not near a power source or if there is no power.  The flashlight puts out quality light and overall, I am quite happy with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DXVB46J2FLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGR3QT0#wasThisHelpful","R9DXVB46J2FLZ","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Black and Decker 8-Slice Extra Wide Toaster Oven is quite impressive in some aspects.  As advertised, this toaster oven will easily fit a 13x9 inch baking pan and have room to spare on all sides.  The unit is also capable of broiling items which I find very handy.  Simply move the rack up to the top, throw cheese on top of my nachos in the pan provided and viola, in 60 to 90 seconds I have perfectly browned, melted cheese!On the flip side, there were a few things I did not care for.  To make toast in this oven on the medium setting takes roughly 4 minutes (and personally, I like my toast a little darker than what the medium setting gave me, so for me, it takes even longer).  I am not sure if this oven actually holds 8 slices, but I am sure it does for a reason.  If I had to make toast in this oven 2 slices at a time for the entire family, I would either always be late for work or I would be chronically sleep deprived.The instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.  Fortunately, I think the controls on this oven are quite simple and easy to figure out.For me, the major drawback is the size of the toaster oven.  The oven is not much smaller than a counter top microwave oven.  While it is light enough to easily move around, it is large enough where finding a place to store it is not an easy task.I loved the fact that the crumb tray is removable from the outside.  This makes cleaning up all the burnt food bits that fall to the bottom of the oven a breeze.Honestly, this is one of those products I have mixed feelings about.  For me, part of the appeal of a toaster oven is having something that is small enough to fit on top of a counter that I can make small items easily without using my regular oven.  On those hot Midwest summer days where using the regular oven makes it feel like it is 120F in the kitchen, using a small toaster oven is great!  When I sit this on the counter, it is as wide as one of my cabinet doors and it takes up a lot of counter top real estate.I believe this product is great for the right target audience.  If one has limited access to kitchen appliances such as in an office you never leave or in a dorm room, I think this is a great item.  However,  if kitchen space is tight and you are looking for something small, while this seems to be a great","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCHBRE2QZTHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I428#wasThisHelpful","R1TCHBRE2QZTHY","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our initial inspection of the towel in the package was quite favorable.  The towel is brightly colored and the graphic design is quite awesome.  After taking it out of the package, my opinion of the item was much less favorable.My biggest gripe about the towel is the fact that it is super thin.  When I say thin, this towel is thinner than the thin towels you find at cheap, low rent hotels.  The fabric very much reminded my wife and I of the thin fabric that they use in those promotional items that are shaped and you put it in water and it expands into a wash cloth (Magic Pop Up Towel Wash Cloth).The size of the item seems to be geared toward younger children.  Upon seeing the size of the towel, I would not recommend buying it for a child over 5.The physical design of the towel is very simplistic.  The sides of the towel are completely open.  Fold a towel the long way and cut a hole for your head along the folded seam, add a washcloth hood over the hole and you have this poncho towel.Despite the thin, cheap feeling fabric, the towel is absorbent.  It seemed to absorb a fair amount of water and left the skin feeling as dry as one would expect.  I doubt it would hold enough water to dry an adult, but it seemed to work with children just fine.Overall, the graphics on this towel are excellent and very well done.  However, the fabric is thin and the quality of something I would expect to buy from a dollar store.  I am sure others might feel differently, but personally, I would not pay more than $10 for this item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNYP9GUZWD4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXINISS#wasThisHelpful","R2FNYP9GUZWD4M","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third Ever After High Thronecoming doll to grace our house, the other two being C.A. Cupid and the other being Raven Queen.  As with other dolls from the Ever After High Thronecoming series, the clothing and overall appearance of this doll is exquisite.  The dress that adorns Apple White is a very attractive multi layer design and her accessories accent her overall look quite well.However, there are two things that I felt were subpar when compared to the other dolls.  The first is Apple Whites forearms.  Her forearms are a slightly different color, which I guess is supposed to simulate gloves.  However, the color just seems off to me.  The color is kind of a translucent white colored that reminds me a lot of the white used in rubber fishing lures.The other thing is that the hair really does not remain nice looking after a minor bit of use.  After 30 days, the dolls hair is ruffled and messy looking.  My kids also report that the glittered strands of hair seem to come out easily.While Apple White is not the greatest, most beautiful doll of the Ever After High Thronecoming series in my opinion, it still is a beautiful doll.  It is definitely a doll that I would feel great about buying as a gift to give or buy my own children.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B28V1XHJ8JIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCRCK#wasThisHelpful","R3B28V1XHJ8JIE","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The setup on this PC was a bit unnerving.  This is the third Window 8.X PC I have setup in the last few months.  I did not time the setup from start to finish on this machine, but what I did not like about the initial setup with this PC is that it seemed to do nothing for several minutes.Once I got back the initial PC setup, the start screen pretty much looked like the any other Windows 8 based PC.  When I went into the desktop mode, I was greeted by a myriad of icons for links and software that were pre-installed on the PC.  I did not see anything that I would deem was of concern, but personally I like my new PCs clean and do not like to have to invest time in a new product to clean it up to use it.I was quite interested in the audio of this computer, given that it was advertized to have audio by Beats.  I was really hoping for crystal clear sound that would blow me away.  In the end, the audio was pretty much the same as every other laptop I have.  I tested the audio with two songs, Cruise by Florida Georgia Line and Ruby Tuesday by the Rolling Stones.  With a higher pitches song like Cruise, the speakers sounded pretty good.  When I put Ruby Tuesday through the speakers, I could tell the speakers really cut out the low end.  With the factory audio on my HP laptop, I can hear the cello playing quite well.  On this PC, the cello is barely audible at all.  So the audio is not bad by any means, but it does not seem any better than my other laptops.The touch screen worked flawless for me.  What I did not care for was the color and the quality of the display.  The display looked faded and washed out.  Looking at photos and videos on the display just is not that impressive.  The screen does seem to be pretty forgiving when it comes to the viewing angle.  The screen is fairly visible from a wide variety of angles.The tablet feature works great; however, using the PC in tablet mode is a bit awkward in my opinion.  The resulting size is about 25% bigger than my full sized iPad when comparing screen area.  Whereas the iPad with cover weighs in at 1 pound 13 ounces, this PC weighs in at 3 pounds 15 ounces.  I am sure the tablet mode would be advantageous to someone for something, but I am not sure to who and for what.  Given the extra size and weight, if I needed a tablet, I would rather use a tablet, not this PC.If you are looking for a cheap, basic laptop, this would probably be a good choice.  I had no issues using this PC for light usage, but nothing stood out to me at excellent either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZF9OGI4VST2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDI9C4O#wasThisHelpful","RZF9OGI4VST2B","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been working night shift for about the last 10 years.  I tried a number of things to try and block the daylight and get a better nights sleep.  I bought room darkening roller blinds for the windows which helped.  I then got wooden blinds to try and help diffuse the light leaking in from the sides with limited success.  I resorted to putting thick comforters on the curtain rods, which did not thrill my wife at all, but seemed to help quite a bit.I had tried the cheap, low quality sleep masks given to me by the airlines when travelling in business or first class to Asia when I used to travel for a living and I did not care for them.  I thought I would give a sleep mask another try.  I looked for what appeared to be a good quality sleep mask and settled on the Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep MaskMy initial impressions of the sleep mask were excellent.  When I first started using it, the sleep mask blocked out 100% of the light.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not see light anywhere in the mask.  Not being used to the mask, I did find the elastic band a bit tight at times.  There definitely is a bit of an adjustment period for that.  The part of my head the strap would rest against would actually ache in the morning when I was first getting used to it.  After a few weeks I was used to it and it no longer bothered me.After several months, I noticed that I would be getting light leaking through the bottom of my mask around my nose.  As goofy as it sounds, I had to remind myself to look straight when going to sleep and the light did not bother me.  The light peeking through is a bit annoying.  In a strange way, I felt attracted to look at it, kind of like those bugs in the movie Wreck It Ralph.Over the year, the elastic strap did require adjusting as the elastic wore out to the point I cannot get it much tighter with the Velcro on the strap.  After about a year of daily usage, the fabric is coming off the inside of the mask.  The mask is still useable, but I am getting a new one because the fabric bunches up and can get uncomfortable.After a year, I am a convert.  I use my sleep mask every night and this is the best I have slept in years.  My wife turns on the bedroom lights in the morning as she gets ready for work and the kids ready for school and I sleep through it all.In a way, the mask can be addicting though.  I did not take my mask with me on my trip to Alaska this summer as when I go to bed at a normal time, the early morning sunlight had never bothered me before.  Without my sleep mask, I was up as soon as the sun was out, which was a bit of a drag.If for one reason or another, light is preventing you from getting a good nights sleep, then I highly recommend this mask with the caveat that the mask only lasts a limited time before it starts to fall apart.  Personally, I wore out my first one and am happily buying a second.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO5O2KIHJGM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CCI4YU#wasThisHelpful","R2AO5O2KIHJGM8","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Ever After High Thronecoming doll that has graced our house.Much like the other Ever After High Thronecoming doll we have, the manufacturer did not skimp on the details.  The dress that comes with the doll is astounding.  All aspects of the doll, from her shoes to her hairclip all have little details that seem to make the doll stand out from most other dolls in my kids collection.The only downfall I have seen with this doll is the hair and the hairstyle.  I am not sure if it is the wings that Raven comes with or if it is how the hair is held in place, but the hair on the doll started to pull out of its style immediately after we removed the doll from its box.  After a few weeks of use, much of the hair has pulled out of the hairstyle, giving the doll a wild, unkept look.Overall, this doll has awesome detail and will surely make any little girl happy.  If it was not for the hairstyle falling apart so quickly, I would say this is easily a 5 star product.  Given the problem with the hair, I am giving the doll 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G6ZWHWKGRC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCPYU#wasThisHelpful","R5G6ZWHWKGRC7","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Alienware PC.  When I opened up the box, I have to say I thought the overall Alien theme is pretty cool.I found the package included a desktop computer, a keyboard, an optical mouse, a power supply, and a cool alien sticker.  There are two DVDs, one indicating it is the Dell OS Recovery DVD and the other is labeled an Alienware X51 R2 Resource DVD.  The only instructions I found was a small quick start pamphlet, which is only good if you have never set up a PC before.The initial setup was quite easy.  I had a monitor (the unit does not come with a monitor), my password for the wireless router, and my Microsoft account.  From opening the box, connecting everything, and powering the PC up was a mere 6 minutes.  From power-up to completely done was another 9 minutes for a total setup time of 15 minutes.I was unaware of what the Alienware Resource DVD was so I popped it in the PC after the initial setup.  I got a screen indicating that the DVD contained Dell Drivers and Utilities.  I selected my OS and indeed the DVD contains the Alienware Command Center and various drivers used on the PC.The PC itself has an attractive, sleek design.  I personally loved how the aliens eyes light up when the PC is powered on.I knew that Alienware comes with the Alien Command Center.  Perhaps it is my unfamiliarity with Windows 8.1 or perhaps I am just getting old and my PC knowledge is getting dated, but for the life of me, I could not find how to access the Command Center. I resorted to installing it from the Alienware Resource DVD and created a shortcut to the desktop.  I was able to access it after that to tune various aspects of the PC and change the lighting scheme.The performance of the PC seems quite good, but I am not a high level gamer.  I was not completely blown away by the quickness of the system, but it still seems to be a decent quality system.  I did love the fact there are a large number and variety of ports on the PC, a huge improvement over the on-sale PCs I have picked up at brick and mortar stores when I suddenly had a PC die on me.Overall, this PC is an attractive unit with pretty good performance.  If you are looking for a PC just to surf the internet, then there are much more cost effective options on the market.  If you are looking for a higher performance PC, then I think this is one to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LL52CJ6JGAGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0HMX12#wasThisHelpful","R3LL52CJ6JGAGY","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update:  To be fair to Dell, for now, I am leaving my initial review and rating unchanged as I have not had a chance to run this issue by their customer support.  I hope to do that in a week or so.  This PC has been experiencing Wi-fi issues on a more frequent basis.  Standard fixes such as running System Restore and updating the wi-fi driver from the Dell have proven ineffective.  I confirmed that the issue is not limited to my home network as I took the PC on a trip and the same problem happened on multiple networks.  I will adjust my review and star rating depending on Dell Support's response and ability to remedy the issue.  The PC will lose connectivity to the attached wi-fi network.  Fixes range from the PC resetting the wi-fi adapter to having to power cycle the PC.  Connectivity ranges from minutes to hours.  I just want potential buyers to beware of the issue I am currently having so they can make an informed decision.  I'm not sure if this PC can be connected to a router or modem device via a wire.  There is no RJ45 port.I am not a PC aficionado by any means.  To me, a PC is a tool that is used to get work done.  The brand of PC I buy usually depends on what is on whenever my current PC decides to die.  However, when I opened the box on this laptop, I have to say the unit just seems to scream quality.When closed, the laptop roughly measures 12.5 inches by 9.75 inches with a closed thickness of roughly 0.5 inches.  I put the laptop on the kitchen scale and it weighed in at 4 pounds, 8 ounces.The screen casing and housing in the keyboard area are constructed out of a lightweight metal, which to me is an excellent upgrade over the cheaper plastic casings found on most laptops.  The bottom of the laptop does indeed appear to be a weaved carbon fiber material or a material that resembles it.  As advertised, this material does seem to stay a bit cooler than conventional materials.  After having the laptop on my lap for several hours, the unit is warm but far from hot to the touch.I found setup of the PC quick and easy.  Armed with the password to my wireless router and a Microsoft account, I was able to go from powering the PC up to surfing the internet in just under 10 minutes.The unit comes installed with Windows version 8.1.  Rating the Windows OS version is beyond the scope of this review, but I will say that I am not fond of the Windows 8.X series operating systems.  If you have not used Windows 8 in the past, prepare for a bit of a learning curve.  It is easy enough to perform basic functions on, but I find it difficult to change PC settings after years of using older Windows versions.The display, color, and resolution on this computer is astounding.  To check the color and resolution, I viewed a recent picture we took in Canada of a young light brown colored bear eating clover and dandilions and the colors really looked incredible.  The same with some photos of an area known as Miles Canyon.  The colors are gorgeous and very lifelike.The touch screen functionality seems to be accurate and has almost worked flawlessly.  I did run into a hiccup where it quit working that I will mention later.I put about 11 years worth of digital photos and videos on the PC, totaling 33540 individual files.  This amount of data took up a mere 16% of the 1TB harddrive.The speaker is located at the front bottom of the laptop.  To me, this seems to really make the quality of the audio variable depending on what the laptop is sitting on.  I have listen to the same song with the PC sitting on my lap and different surfaces and the audio quality ranged from good to excellent.The keyboard on the unit is a bit different.  At first, it seems small and a bit awkward.  It does take a bit of getting used to.  I personally did not care for the PgUp and PgDn buttons as they require a ""function"" button sequence to access.In roughly the month we have used this laptop, we did encounter 2 issues.  At one point, the wi-fi quit with an error indicating the wi-fi adapter was disabled.  After searching the internet and looking for an on/off switch for the wi-fi, the issue was resolved with the Network troubleshooting assistant in windows.The second issue was the touch screen quit working.  This was remedied with a reboot of the system.Overall, this laptop seems like an excellent, high-quality product.  If you are looking for a light, high-end laptop, this PC is definitely worth consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298A5R1L9JH7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGECA#wasThisHelpful","R298A5R1L9JH7U","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I have stated in similar reviews, I do not play with dolls and would not admit it on the internet if I did.  So I turned the doll over to my 3 children and let them play with it.  This is what they had to say:8 year old:  When I asked them what they thought about the doll, they told me, ""It is good"".  They also commended that her bangs were stiff like they were full of hairspray.  They also went on to say that the mask did not stay on the dolls hand too well and when the mask was on the dolls hand, it was hard to bring the mask to their face.  Overall, they did like the doll and they gave it 4 stars.6 year old:  They said the doll was nice.  However, they seemed to be hung up about the fact glitter coming out of her hair and getting all over everything.  She was a bit more unforgiving and gave the doll 3 stars.10 year old:  My 10 year old really like the doll.  However, they said that they thought the arms are hard to move.  They liked that the dress was big and there was a lot of details put into the doll.  They also said they really like how their makeup is done.  They gave it 4 stars.My wife and I examined the doll.  One thing we tried and thought it was worth mentioning is that Barbie clothes are much too big on the doll.  If you have mass amount of Barbie clothes, they will not work on this doll.  Also, the shoes are very difficult to remove.  This can either be a positive or a negative.  Personally I do not think this is a bad thing.  The dolls hair gets caught on the wings and kind of gets messed up as a result as well.Overall, this seems to be very high quality product.  I think the craftsmanship in the dress is excellent and the details in the makeup on the face is impressive.  Personally, I give the doll 5 stars.

"When I received this item, to say my 3 children were excited is an understatement.  While I had never seen this Barbie set before, the kids seemed to know exactly what it was and were very excited.I began assembly and putting stickers on the unit.  From beginning to end, to assemble the camper and put all the stickers on took 46 minutes.  I found assembly fairly easy, but a bit tedious.  A few pieces took me a little time to figure out exactly where they went, but assembly went smoothly overall.Being that I do not particularly care to play with Barbies, I turned the camper over to my three children to evaluate.10 year old:  The only complaints they had was that the chandelier came apart on them once, though they were able to reassemble it.  They also mentioned it was difficult to store the dishes and snap them in place.  They loved the fact there were a lot of beds and the camper came with food.  They specifically mentioned how they liked the lemonade dispenser and how it looks like it drains.  They gave the camper 4.5 stars8 year old:  They informed me that they really liked the fact there were lots of beds, but thought there should be 4 beds instead of 3 as there are 4 Barbie sisters.  They thought it would be nice if the bathroom was a bit bigger and wished the camper set included a doll.  They liked how the food and such snapped into place so it would not move.  They loved how everything folds up and can be stored in the camper, but indicated that it can be hard to arrange everything so it all fits.  They gave the camper 4.5 stars.6 year old:  They loved the set overall, but wondered why there was only 1 blanket for 3 beds.  They brought up an interesting point that when the camper is folded up, there is no floor or bottom.  They told me that sometimes when the camper is closed up, sometimes things will fall out the bottom while they are playing with it (I did not notice this at first, but there definitely are gaps in the bottom).  They gave the camper 5 stars.Again, while I did not play much with the unit, I will say that my initial impression of the Dreamhouse Camper was quite positive.  I thought the unit was well designed and constructed very well.  The only thing that I did not do it for me was the detachable cab.  The kids like it, but it seems to be a strange aspect of the design to me.  I noticed that even after having the Dreamhouse Camper for several weeks, the kids are still playing with it on a daily basis and is one of their favorite toys.  I give the camper 5 stars.Overall, I think this is a great toy and one my kids love!  With as much fun as my 3 children have had with this toy, I feel that the Dreamhouse Camper is well worth the current price of $90.  Averaging my family's ratings together, I get a mean rating of 4.75 stars which I will happily round up to 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPYAKPI9KYXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFC6QC#wasThisHelpful","R3VPYAKPI9KYXN","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With three young girls at home, one being a huge Monster High fan, the kids were quite excited and had high hopes for this playset.  After getting a lecture from my 8 year old on the difference between Monster High and Ever After High and the origins of Briar Beauty, I realized I was in over my head and just moved onto the assembly portion on the set.Assembly for me took just under 20 minutes.  I had no specific issues except I did not realize the ""spine"" of the book was actually a storage area where the bed was stored.  Also, the railing at the very top of the set was missing in my set, or it is hidden well enough that I never found it.  While I did not spend any time playing with the set, my impression of the set was not very favorable.  To me, the set seemed flimsy and not very sturdy.  I then turned it over to my three children to test.8 year old:  My eight year old really liked the doll and accessories.  However, they specifically said that they thought the house ""was a mess"".  They also commented that it was hard to get the mask on the doll.  They gave the set 3 stars, attributing most of the rating toward the doll, which they loved.10 year old:  Their exact words are ""I wouldn't give this as a present to anyone.""  They hated the fact the DJ stand in the house was made out of paper and they felt the set would not withstand any significant usage.  They also mentioned they thought the hands pop off the doll real easy.  They gave the set 1 star.6 year old:  Similar to my 10 year old, my 6 year old did not like the fact the DJ stand was made out of paper.  They commented that it was really hard to get the doll in the DJ stand and have the DJ stand keep the right shape.  They only gave the set 1 star as well.Personally, I do think the set feels cheap and I am disappointed that it came missing a piece.  I will give the set some kudos for the overall design, how the bed is stored, and how compact the set can become for storage.  However, I was just not impressed with the execution of the idea.  If I had paid the current price of $49.99, I would have felt a little ripped off.  I would give the set 3 stars, but I am deducting a star for the missing piece, giving the set a rating of 2 stars.After having the set for several weeks, it pretty much sits on the side unplayed with.  My children also got the Barbie Sisters Life in The Dreamhouse Camper around the same time and that playset is still being used on a daily basis while this one collects dust.Averaging all our ratings together, as a family, we gave the set a mean rating of 1.75 stars which I will round up to 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJKALPQIRVVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCGIA#wasThisHelpful","R3AJKALPQIRVVP","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I grabbed one of these bags and shook it open, I have to admit, I did not have high expectations.  The bags looked cheap, felt cheap, and sounded cheap.  Given that, I was expecting a poor performing trash bag that would rip and fall apart easily.Right before our weekly trash pickup, I grabbed one of these bags and began to make the trash rounds around the house.  I emptied every garbage can I had into the bag and then dumped all the litter from the guinea pig cage into the bag.  By the time all was said and done, I put the bag on the scale and found that I had just over 25 pounds of trash in the bag.  A corner of a cardboard box and a discarded plastic hanger poked through the bag, but even with the weight and the holes in the bag, the trash bag did not tear any further and remained intact.While my initial impression of the product was a poor one, the bags held together quite well.  If you have a need for large trash bags, these are worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFPYEOAX9PPAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q5ZOIW#wasThisHelpful","RFPYEOAX9PPAX","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will be the first to admit that I have not cooked on cast iron in years.  After the negative press that nonstick cookware has gotten in recent years, I was interested in trying to cook with cast iron once again.I unpacked the unit and the first thing I noticed is the out of place handle on the lid.  The handle of the lid is a porcelain coated knob that is screwed into the top of the lid.  The screw securing mine seems to come loose awfully easy.  Personally, this gives me a bit if an uneasy feeling as I do not like the loose feeling when I am dealing with hot metal.The inside and outside of the unit is rough textured.  This is different than the cast iron pans I remember which I recall tended to have a much smoother cooking surface.  I seasoned the unit prior to first use and despite the rough surface, I had no issues with food sticking to or cleaning the cooking surface.What I did not care for is that the dutch oven has edges.  While these edges were not sharp, I thought they gave the unit a very unfinished appearance.  The top of the pot portion is rounded much like I would expect it, but the edges of the handles and the cover have a sharp, unfinished look.Finally, the lid does not seem to be perfectly round.  A few spots on the edges are flattened.  It appears that lid was cast that way as I did not see any deformation in the metal, but it gives the appearance that the lid was dropped and dented.Overall, I had no problem cooking with or cleaning the dutch oven, so in my opinion, the unit is completely functional.  However, I think it falls a bit short in the looks department.  I am sure how their cat iron cookware looks is a minor point to some people, but I just think the unit looks hurried and unfinished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368UBH0WJ5SWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWSQCFE#wasThisHelpful","R368UBH0WJ5SWS","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those rare products that I really have nothing bad to say about.  If you are looking for a small table to use in bed or while sitting upright in a couch or large chair, this is definitely one to consider.The area of the table is roughly about the same size as a TV tray (for those old enough to remember), maybe even a bit larger.  The surface of the table is actually 2 pieces, a solid piece which is about 1/3rd of the table and a hinged piece which is about 2/3rds of the table area.The hinged area folds up and has a metal bar in the back to hold it in place at 1 of 6 possible positions.  There are two holes drilled in the bottom of the table, to which a removable strip of wood can be inserted.  In the event you are using a laptop or book while that portion of the table is in the tilted position, the item will not slide off.  When this portion of the table is not elevated, it is held into the closed position by a magnet.The legs of the table fold underneath the table for easy storage.  The legs on each side can be adjusted which helps keep the tray level.  We found this an awesome feature when trying to serve breakfast in bed.  You can adjust one side higher than the other to make the table level and account for the person lying in bed slightly compressing the mattress on one side more than the other.There is a small drawer on the right side, which I use for storing the wooden strip when not in use.  The drawer can stick a little bit at times.  The drawer is not very big.  With the wooden piece in there, I can fit a few pens and a pack of Post-its if needed.Overall, I think this is an excellent product.  It is sturdy and well built.  The little drawer to store the removable wooden strip was a great idea to prevent the end user from losing it.  Whether it is for using a laptop in bed, serving someone breakfast in bed, or to work on a craft while sitting in a recliner, this table is versatile and an awesome design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUCU78XTS3PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQMAEYK#wasThisHelpful","R3EUCU78XTS3PD","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am reviewing this mattress from two perspectives, my own and my oldest daughters.  My bed has a high end latex mattress we spent several thousand on at the time.  My daughter is the one with the full sized bed and her mattress was the $200 mattress we got from the local warehouse store.The mattress was shipped via a nationwide cargo carrier.  In my case, the mattress was shipped only wrapped in a heavy plastic bag.  However, the mattress did arrive clean and damage free.I slept on the mattress for about a week.  My overall impression of the mattress was highly favorable.  The mattress is on the firm side.  However, despite being firm, the mattress envelops you slightly.  I am guessing this is the plush and gel layers.  This gives you a firm, yet comfortable surface to sleep on that seems to hug and caress the body.The mattress seems to be well crafted.  There are no pressure points or springs that I could feel when I was laying down on the mattress.The mattress does transfer some motion, but nowhere near as much as some of the older, cheaper mattresses in our house.  I laid down on the mattress and had two kids jump up and down on the other side of the bed.  While I could feel some motion, it did not feel like a lot.  I would guess a partner rolling out of bed in the morning would disturb me slightly, but probably would not wake me up.The only thing that I have to say about the mattress that is somewhat negative is that I am not sure that I buy the cooling factor of the mattress.  I did not feel any cooler on this mattress than I did on my latex mattress.I then handed the mattress over to my 11 year old.  In her words, it is nice and it keeps her cooler.  I pressed her for more details.  She said that she likes it a lot better than her previous mattress (the $200 mattress from a warehouse store).  Finally, she says she gets a good nights sleep on the mattress and reports sleeping better in this mattress than her old mattress.Overall, both my daughter and I really liked this mattress.  I really liked the fact it is firm yet very comfortable and is wonderful to sleep on.  Personally, if I paid $1000 for this mattress, I would feel that it was worth the money.  I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone who likes sleeping on a firm mattress","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4EYNJIEEUQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMV6POE#wasThisHelpful","R2H4EYNJIEEUQA","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and kids love popcorn and have used various popcorn seasonings at times.  I thought Kernel Seasons Cheesy Variety Pack might be a nice treat for the family.  When I received the seasonings, I popped some microwave popcorn and set up a taste testing with me and my three kids (10, 8, and 6).  All the kids were asked to try the products without their siblings present to get different opinions from each.Nacho Cheedar:  I tried this and did not think it was terrible.  It is the strongest flavored in my opinion, but I found the flavor artificial tasting.  It is a bit salty on its own, but I did not find it overly salty on the popcorn as long as I did not add additional salt.  All three of my children pretty much had the same comment.  None of them really thought it tasted like Nacho.  Everyone in my family gave it 3 stars out of 5.White Cheddar:  This is by far the family favorite.  I found the seasoning to have a nice cheesy flavor with a slightly sweet finish.  The flavor is not as overpowering as the Nacho Cheddar, but is much stronger than the Garlic Parmesan.  While the flavor was good to me, it seemed similar to every other White Cheddar flavored product on the snack market.  All three of my children thought it had a good flavor with my 8 year old saying it was very yummy.  My 10 year old gave it 4.5 stars, my 8 year old 4.5 stars, and my 6 year old 5 stars.  Personally, I give the White Cheddar a solid 4 stars.Garlic Parmesan:  This is the most subtle flavored of the three.  I could taste subtle hints of garlic.  The flavoring reminded me of a cheap, powdery alfredo sauce.  My 10 year old really liked it, but it took a lot to get a good taste she said.  My two younger children really did not think it was garlicy at all.  My 10 year old gave it 3 stars, my 8 year old 3.5 stars, and my 6 year old 3 stars.  I gave it 4 stars, but I did agree with my 10 year old that it took a lot of seasoning to get a good flavor.While the kids did not have glowing reviews during my taste testing, I could not help but notice that they used the seasonings often with their popcorn and seemed to like it.Taking all the ratings for each product given by each person and figuring out the mean rating, I came up with the value of 3.63 stars.Overall, the flavors are not perfect.  However, the product really seems to add a fun, tasty element to popcorn that the kids really seemed to like.  For that, I am rounding it up to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U28XWCDC3BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H727T7Q#wasThisHelpful","R7U28XWCDC3BY","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an elderly dog that has a bit of a urinary incontinence problem.  While we are getting the issue under control with medications, there are occasional accidents, usually on his bedding during the night.  We normally used All Stainlifters Free and Clear Laundry Detergent, 150 Oz and it did not eliminate the urine odors at all.We then used All Free and Clear and used OdoBan Odor Eliminator - RTU Spray W/1 Gallon Concentrate in the rinse cycle and this proved to work quite well at eliminating all the undesirable odors.We then decided to try Tide Plus Febreeze.  While I did not expect the detergent to get rid of all the odors on its own, I decided it was worth a try.The next time the dog had an accident, we laundered the dogs bedding using the Tide Plus Febreeze and nothing else.When I smelled the contents of the bottle, I was not particularly impressed.  To me, it smelled like someone mixed some spring/flowery air freshener with a bottle of vodka.  I dumped the recommended amount in the washing machine with warm water and the soiled dog bedding.The product did to quite an exceptional job with removing the urine odors.  By the time I put the bedding through the dryer, the scent on the bedding was a pleasant, slightly floral, fresh air scent.  There was barely the slightest hint of urine odor.  This product did as well as using Odo-Ban in the rinse cycle.Personally, I think Tide Plus Febreeze has done a better job of stain removal than our normal detergent, All Free and Clear.Overall, I am quite pleased at the detergents ability to clean and mask/eliminate odors.  If you have to deal with smelly, dirty items that need to be washed, I would highly recommend giving Tide Plus Febreeze a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K68QMS52X1CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ6XABI#wasThisHelpful","R3K68QMS52X1CE","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I frequently use kitchen scales to measure portion sizes.  As what is accepted as a portion in America has gotten bigger, so has my waistline.  Personally, I found that weighing out portions for me has been an effective way to help me lose weight.This scale is a basic food scale.  The scale has a glass top and a plastic housing.  The glass top is not removable, which can make it a bit difficult to clean underneath the platform, but not too bad.  The plastic housing sounds cheap and hollow, but has held up very well in the 45 days or so I have been using the scale.The scale measures both in pounds/ounces and in grams.  I grabbed several different items and they all weighed in right where I would expect.  A 10 pound bag of flour weighed in at 9lb 15.6 ounces.  A 5 pound weight was 5 pounds, 0.3 ounces, and a 2.5 pound weight was 2 pounds, 6.9 ounces.  A stick of butter weighs in at 4.1 ounces.  The weights were consistent with our other scale.The scale weighs consistently.  When an item is removed and is put back on the scale, the weight does not change.One of the things I liked the most was the fact the scale uses standard AAA batteries.  I have had a scale that used CR2032 button cells.  This necessitated buying overpriced button cells locally when the batteries ran out or mail ordering them at a good price and waiting.  I really like the fact this scale uses batteries that I use in other things.The only drawback I found with this scale is that it seems liquid can get behind the display easily.  A small spill resulted in condensation behind the display.  The condensation evaporated away from behind the display within a few days though and there seemed to be no effect on the scale.If you are looking for a basic, accurate, and reliable scale, then I would highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2RKXCLN4A40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDS2X2G#wasThisHelpful","R2R2RKXCLN4A40","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:19 MinsThroughout my adult life, I have used cheap hoses and cheap hose carts.  In my recent Vine review of the Scotts SMF58050CC MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose, I learned that cheap hoses just are not worth the hassle.  With the Yard Butler Hose Truck, I learned that cheap plastic hose carts are just a pain to deal with compared to this product.From unboxing the product to completion of assembly was about 20 minutes for me.  To assemble the unit, I ended up using a large socket and ratchet (I used a 24mm which was slightly too big if I recall, but it was the best fit I had handy), a crescent wrench, and a phillips screwdriver.  While assembly was not difficult, it was not the easiest either.  The directions were fairly simple to follow.The first thing that caught my attention was the wheels.  Right off, I could tell the inner tube in the wheels was bulging and the wheels were out of round.  As this cart is not being towed down an interstate at 70 MPH, this is a minor point.  However, what I really did not care for was that if the wheels were secured tightly to the frame, they would not turn.  It seems the bolt puts pressure directly on the rim of the tire.  The result are tires that do not wobble but also will not turn or tires that turn and are loose and wobbly.Once assembled, the cart is quite nice.  As I show in the video, after 30 days, the connector with the hose is starting to rust already.  I am unsure if this is due to poor quality materials or if it is a reaction between the metal in the hose and the hose fitting on the cart.  The cart does feel sturdy once assembled and does make moving my hose from the back yard to the front quite easy.While the unit does seem to be well built, in my opinion it is far from great.  When I was at Sams Club the other day, I stopped and took a look at their hose cart that they sell for about $80.  Their cart had the right angle piece at the point where the short hose connects between the spigot and the hose cart which takes a lot of pressure off the hose.  The wheels on the cart I looked at did not bulge and were secured tightly while still being easy to turn.  Their hose cart pulled like a wagon instead of being pushed like this unit, but their design had 1 axle that moved left and right when pulled, making it very easy to pull around.I think that this unit is nice, but it could use some improvements.  If I lived in a remote area and there were no other alternatives I could buy, then this unit is not a bad unit by any means.  Conversely, if I had the choice between this unit and the $80 cart at Sams Club, I would take the Sams Club unit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXSZCEHG3W00V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOMCKOY#wasThisHelpful","RXSZCEHG3W00V","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will be the first to admit that it has been years since I have used speed hurdles or a speed ladder.  However, with three young children interested in sports, I thought it would be something worth trying once again.The SKLZ Elevation 2-in-1 Speed Hurdles and Ladder has been a fun and so far durable tool for my 3 young children to use.  When I first set this product up, I have to admit that I had some concerns about the durability of the Speed Hurdles/Ladder.  The cross members seemed a bit flimsy, especially when propped up in the hurdle position.  So far, it has survived the onslaught of my 10, 8, and 6 year old daughters.  When they have stepped on a cross member in the up position, there seems to be enough give in the member to help prevent breakage.When broken down, the product consists of 5 rectangular pieces, each measuring roughly 26 inches by 18 inches.  There is a small, drawstring, nylon type bag to store the hurdles/ladder in when not in use.  When collapsed, the product is roughly the size of two pizza boxes side by side.The sides of the hurdles/ladder are connected together by a stretchable cord, which allows for fast assembly and breakdown.  Moving the product from a ladder to hurdles is simply pushing the side pieces together or pulling them apart.I have used other SKLZ products in the past and they seem to be a decent balance of quality, ease of use, and ease of storage.  This product is no exception.  While it seems a bit flimsy, the kids have not yet broken it.  At 250 pounds, I stepped on a cross member in the hurdle position and it did not break.While only time will tell if this product will remain durable after months of use, so far it seems quite promising.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HPR7FZOSKE6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPDH0CC#wasThisHelpful","R3HPR7FZOSKE6F","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my youth, I was a full contact Tae Kwon Do fighter.  As I have aged, I have little to no desire to take a swing at anything that has the potential of hitting back.  However, I am still happy to throw down with the heavy bag on a daily basis.  After talking with a friend who is a boxer, I opted to move up to the 16 ounce boxing style gloves over the much lighter MMA style gloves I was using previously.I picked up a pair of 16 ounce TITLE Boxing Pro Style Leather Training Gloves and was very happy with them.  Then, I was given the opportunity to try the Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves and I thought it would be fun to compare.Upon unwrapping the Venum gloves, the first thing I notice is the logo and artwork on the gloves.  I really do like the snake on the Velcro strap, but I thought the Venum logo screen across the glove was a bit much.  I find this a minor detail as I have never had someone stop me in mid fight to compliment or criticize the logo/artwork on my gear.The gloves are made from PU leather, so they do have a slight plastic odor to them out of the box.  The feel of the exposed surface is much like feeling a stiff, cheap leather product.My hands are neither large nor heavy in mass.  The jeweler who made my wedding ring even went as far to call my hands slender and lady like.  Even with average sized hands, I thought the hand compartment of the Venum gloves was smaller than I was expecting.  By the time I added wraps to my hands, I thought the hand compartment was a bit snug, but not uncomfortably so.  However, I think this could be an issue if a person has large, meaty hands.The gloves themselves are a bit stiff.  Again, I would not call it uncomfortably so.  I guess this comes down to personal preference.  While my TITLE gloves are softer and more supple, there is something about the Venum gloves and the stiffness that I like the feel of when working the heavy bag.Over the last 6 weeks or so, I have used these most days of the week on the heavy bag.  After inspecting the gloves today, I see no signs of tearing or signs of the seams coming apart.  The Venum logo on the glove still looks good.  For the most part, these gloves still look brand new.I put the gloves on a scale and there was roughly an ounce difference between the two gloves.  One glove weighed in at 15.85 ounces and the other glove weighed in at 16.75 ounces.Overall, I have been fairly happy with these gloves.  The only caveat I would offer with these gloves is that if you have large hands, the fit might be a bit tight.  Personally, I am happy with the fit, how the gloves have protected my hands, and how the gloves have worn so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7XG0VAXVYNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087MLCGY#wasThisHelpful","R1R7XG0VAXVYNK","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last set of plates I purchased was $100 for a 16 piece set.  My original set was the Oneida Adriatic Blue set.  While it was a beautiful set in my opinion, the plates kept overheating and breaking in the microwave, despite being labeled as microwaveable.  After losing most of 1 set of the Oneida plates, I had the opportunity to try this set.  I was curious about the quality of a set that was 1/4th the cost of the Oneida plates.My first impression of the set was that the pieces feel quite light in weight, which initially caused me concern.  The pieces are plain yet are attractive.  I used the pieces for about 6 weeks and the plates have undergone regular use.  After weeks of being eaten off of, microwaved, and put through the dishwasher.  After weeks of use, most of the dishes still appear flawless.The only complaint I have so far about the set is that the ring on the bottom of the plates seem to chip easily.  Several of the plates have chipped on this ring.  The chips range from small to quite noticeable.  Despite the chips on the bottom, the viewable surface remain in perfect condition on my set so far.Overall, if you are looking for an affordable, simple, nice looking set of dinnerware of decent quality, I think this is definitely a set worth considering.  As long as the design is attractive to the individuals taste, this is a set I would recommend without hesitation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD1QG2HAG62J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5F6UNE#wasThisHelpful","R3CD1QG2HAG62J","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I have gotten older, the traditional razor and shaving cream method of shaving irritates my skin and prevents me from shaving more than every 2nd or 3rd day.  Electric shavers do not irritate my skin as much, but I had never been satisfied with the quality of the shave.  I had tried various Norelco three head shavers in the past and have been less than satisfied.  Over the years, I settled on a Remington foil type shaver with better results, but it still did not do a great job.  Finally, I just gave up on the idea of shaving everyday.  The last electric shavers I tried would be considered ancient by todays standards.Then I had the opportunity to try Phillips Norelco YS521/41 Click & Style Shave Toolkit.  It had been years since I tried an electric shaver and I wanted to see how the technology has changed over the last decade.I made my final shave with a blade and the next morning I popped on the shave head and proceeded with my morning shave.  I have to say I was incredibly impressed with the results.  While the resulting shave was not blade shave close, it was still a very close shave with hardly any missed whiskers and very few scratchy, stubbly spots.  I have used the shaver most days of the week for a month and have still not recharged the shaver.The only complaint that I have with this electric shaver is that it seems to do an exceptionally poor job with longer whiskers.  The shaver has a tough time dealing with a 2 day beard growth.  I usually have to resort to a blade shave before using the electric shaver again.I then tried the body groomer attachment.  The body groomer takes a little practice do be able to groom yourself without scratching yourself and pulling the hair.  The body groomer attachment works OK.  The foil does not seem to get a close shave of the body hair in my opinion, but I am not 100% sure it is meant to.I played with the beard trimmer a bit, but I do not have a beard.  I tried it on body hair before using the body groomer attachment.  The beard trimmer is easily adjustable and seems to do an OK job.  Not having a beard, I cannot give it a thorough review though.As an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  I was very pleased with the shave I got using this product.  The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.  I think this kit is a solid 4 star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VR820T0STP4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARF428E#wasThisHelpful","R1VR820T0STP4I","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will the first to admit, I am behind the times.  My light on the aquarium was still the old fluorescent tube.  This always made the aquarium orange and dingy looking.  I had the opportunity to try the AquaticLife Edge 36 inch LED aquarium light.When I received the light, my first light was not operational.  The light would cycle through a lighting sequence, but nothing ever appeared on the display where the time should be.  I emailed the customer support address included in the instructions.  I received a reply within several hours.  I called and spoke with a wonderful gentleman from their support team who determined the product I received had a fault and immediately send out a replacement light and a return label.The second light worked exactly as it was supposed to.  The directions to operate the light cover one-half of one side of a sheet of paper.  The directions do not do a very good job explaining how to operate the light.  The light has three channels.  The first channel is a combination of reds, blues, and whites.  By my count, there are 7 blue LEDs, 11 Red LEDs, and 24 white LEDs on channel 1.  Channel 2 consists of 42 white LEDs.  The Moonlight channel consists of 3 Blue LEDs.  Each of the channels are run on independent timers and can be run in any combination with each other.The light has a sunrise/sunset option, which makes the lights turn on and turn off over a period of time set by the user.Overall, I am quite happy with this product.  Despite having a defective product at first, the companys customer support was helpful and a pleasure to work with.  The light seems like a quality product and the LEDs are very bright.  The only issue I had with the product is the instructions.  I think the product would benefit from a longer instruction pamphlet that would explain what the various channels do, when you might want to use each channel, and how exactly the sunrise/sunset function works.  The channels and functions are easy enough to figure out, but it would be nice to have documentation explaining what does what.  Personally, I would recommend this product without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GXHGDVSNAJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3Y4YLW#wasThisHelpful","R29GXHGDVSNAJZ","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am nowhere near as fit as I once was and my knowledge of exercise is becoming old and dusty.  As I try to get back into shape, I thought some exercise videos might help break up the exercise routine a bit.  After reading about RIPPED, I thought it might be something I would like to try.I will not waste time giving the background on what RIPPED is.  To me, an exercise video serves two purposes, to instruct and help motivate.  The million dollar question to me is does this video to this?I am not a trainer and I will even go as far to say my knowledge of exercises is limited.  Many of these moves I could not even tell you if the instructors demonstrated correctly.  However, in my opinion, most things were demonstrated well enough for me to do them.  The part I did not care for was the endurance section.  In my youth, I was a martial arts fighter.  When I viewed the tutorial for the endurance portion, I thought the portion involving the punching techniques could have been explained much better.  What I thought would have been highly beneficial was if they explained the footwork behind the punches.  I also thought they should have stressed control in punching techniques, but that is just me.  The purpose of the video is to exercise, not to train someone to be in the ring.The exercises in the video range from slow and easy to fast and complex.  As with any new activity, learning the moves takes time.  The first few times, I definitely felt like I was messing everything up and felt uncoordinated.  I still feel a bit on the uncoordinated side, but it is getting better.Does this video motivate me?  To be honest, I find the instructors too cheery for my taste.  As with most videos, the participants seem to be tight and well muscled.  There are a few token large people like me, but they are in the back and largely unseen IMHO.I do think the video provides a decent workout for the average person.  I find that I am quite tired as the video was nearing the end and to be honest.Overall, RIPPED seems to be a decent exercise video.  It is now something I have incorporated into my exercise routine and incorporate it once or twice a week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGNB21ZWZZGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF46P6E#wasThisHelpful","R1YGNB21ZWZZGN","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw that this product was labeled as a science lab, I was under the impression that the product would contain everything you needed to conduct a series of simple science experiments.  I was quite shocked when I opened the box and basically found 4 containers, a spoon, a couple molds, a mini toilet, a bubble wand, and a book.My daughters and I began playing with the set on a whim one day (still thinking at least some ingredients were included).  After finding out the set included nothing except the containers and the book, I started flipping through the book.  The book contains a series of 20 simple experiments and 6 secondary experiments (a second experiment you can do with the results of the first).  Some experiments are fun yet scientific based, while others are just included for the gross factor.  The time required to conduct the experiments vary from instant to hours.  The problem I ran into was the fact I had all the ingredients on hand for very few experiments.So what ingredients are needed?Experiment #1:  Baking soda, vinegar, food coloring, and waterExperiment #2:  Dry yeast, sugar, and waterExperiment #3:  Food coloring, unflavored gelatin, light corn syrup, and waterExperiment #4:  Borax, white glue, food coloring, and waterExperiment #5:  Garlic, dish soap, rubbing alcohol, and water.  A garlic press is recommendedExperiment #6:  Garlic and water.  A garlic press and a balloon are required.Experiment #7:  Corn starch, chocolate syrup, food coloring, light corn syrup, and waterExperiment #8:  Ivory bar soap and a microwaveExperiment #9:  Cooking spray, applesauce, unflavored gelatin, oatmeal/raisin bran, instant coffee/cocoa powder, and waterExperiment #10: Cooking spray, colored cereal, marshmallows, and butterExperiment #11: Cooking spray, juice/water, Jello (orange or yellow), and food coloringExperiment #12: Cooking spray, orange Jello, nonfat evaporated milk, food coloring, and waterExperiment #13: Milk, food coloring, dish soap, and waterExperiment #14: Honey, light corn syrup, milk, vegetable oil, and food coloringExperiment #15: Disposable diaper, food coloring, and waterExperiment #16: Cabbage (purple or red), lemon juice, baking soda, vinegar, dish soap, and waterExperiment #17: Vegetable oil and corn starchExperiment #18: Carbonated water or soda (clear or light colored is best) and navy beansExperiment #19: Raw egg and vinegarExperiment #20: Cornstarch and waterDespite the set being rather basic, if you have the ingredients handy, I think this can be a fun and educational experience for children.  Not having the above list, I had the ingredients for 5 experiments and of those, 2 were something the kids already knew well.  If I had the ingredient list before hand, we could have performed the much cooler experiments while the kids showed interest.Overall, I think this set has some value to it.  On one hand, you can do most of these experiments for free with some old Tupperware containers and an internet connection.  However, I think the customized containers, the flushing toilet mixer, and having all the data and directions complied in a single source makes things more fun for the kids and much easier on the adults.While I know prices of products fluctuate all the time, I am not sure the value for the money is there at roughly $20.  If the kit was more in the $10 to $15 range, I would say that this is probably a must try.  Any higher than that, in my opinion, it would not be worth the money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35AN7MF2D72PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD9AIUE#wasThisHelpful","R35AN7MF2D72PR","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife used to have beautiful, thick, straight hair when we met.  After our first child, her hair developed wavy curls in it (which I think are still beautiful) and 10 years later, it is still that way.  As my hair is short and straight to begin with, I felt that it would be much better to try this product on my wife than on myself.We plugged the flat iron in and tried the heat at the 200C that the thermostat was initially set at.  The iron advertises that it is ready to use in about 30 seconds and while I did not have a stop watch in hand, I would agree that 30 seconds was about right.As I mentioned, my wifes hair is nice and thick and in order for the flat iron to work optimally, we had to turn it all the way up to the max setting of 230C.  Once the heat was turned all the way up, the iron worked beautifully.  My wifes hair glided effortlessly through the heat plates.  With about 5 minutes worth of work, my wifes hair went from wavy and curly to mostly straight.My wife did most of the testing and thus the comments are mostly from her.  The iron is very lightweight and even after being on for about 10 minutes, the handle was still nice and cool.  The swivel cord is an ingenious feature that really helped keep the cord straight and not bunch up under the iron.  The rounded end makes the iron easy to slide under your hair close to your scalp without burning you.  The digital thermostat is easy to set and easy to read.Overall, this is an excellent quality product and one that we would recommend without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDMK3J57RGQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYDSAO4#wasThisHelpful","RZDMK3J57RGQ5","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, a first aid kit is a very specialized thing.  I have traveled to many different places and have done many different activities.  If I were designing first aid kits, my ideal first aid kits for the home environment, white collar office environment, travel to hot 3rd world countries, coaching a sports team, and traveling in the remote Alaskan/Canadian arctic would all be different.  So what do I think about this kit?This first aid kit seems to be designed mainly for minor events like small cuts, scrapes, minor burns, and insect stings.  Of the 355 pieces advertised in this kit, 257 of the pieces are adhesive bandages, 40 are antiseptic wipes, and 12 are ointments.  With those three item categories alone, 87% of the kits contents would treat nothing more than the minor issues I mentioned above.  If encountered with a situation where excessive bleeding might occur or some sort of more serious traumatic injury, this kit would not be much help (though the kit does contain 1 ABD pad per ANSI standards).If one is planning on using this kit in an office setting or at home, I think this kit is very beneficial.  The cover for the case could have been better quality in my opinion.  It will flex and bow if the contents of the case are not placed in the case just right.  However, the rest of the case is a bit cheap feeling, but sturdy.  I have not had any issues with the cover staying closed.  I would like to subject the case to a drop test as if it were mounted on the wall and knocked off, but to be honest, I am not sure it would survive the impact.I examined the perishable contents of the case and most of the contents that have expiration dates have about 1.5 to 2 years before they expire.  The earliest expiration date I found was 7/2015.  The latest was 1/2016.The bandages are of OK quality.  There are better bandages on the market in my opinion, but these do just fine.The only major complaint I have about this first aid kit is the tweezers.  The tweezers are cheap plastic.  They might remove a bee stinger or something that can be removed easily, but for the most part, they have little gripping ability.The kit does come with a first aid reference guide.  I do have a few issues with this.  In my kit, the guide was buried at the bottom of the largest compartment.  The rather plain appearance of the outside of the guide makes it look much like a typed letter.  If someone needs this guide and is not familiar with the kit, it might take some time to look and find it.  I would think that it might be better to mount it on the inside of the lid.  When I read the guide, I will say it was a decent quick reference.  The part on the back/neck injuries failed miserably though.  It tells you signs of what to look for and tells you how it can be highly life threatening, but then does not tell you anything how to treat it.  It does not even tell you to not move the person.  The CPR section outlines the traditional compression and rescue breaths method versus the hands only method.A first aid kit is only going to be as useful as the knowledge of the person utilizing it.  Just having it is not going to be enough.  Without training, will the average person know how to use a triangle bandage or what an ABD Compress is for?Overall, this is not a bad first aid kit for a low risk environment.  In the home or office setting where storage space is not a huge issue, this kit would be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QBPMSDWVGVJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018NE57M#wasThisHelpful","R3QBPMSDWVGVJD","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three things I can never find in my house are a screwdriver, AA batteries, and a pair of scissors.  With three small children who love to create things with paper, our good scissors constantly were being used by the children and misplaced.  As soon as we would buy new scissors, they would disappear in some abstract corner in our house.  Sewing scissors, kitchen scissors, plain old office scissors, it never mattered, they always disappeared only to be found days or months later.We got the Westcott School Scissor Caddy and gave them to the kids to use.  The caddy is solid and seems well built.  The scissors are contained in 4 color coordinated cups, which are removable.  The cups fit into a ring attached to the caddy and the cups can be spun around the caddy.The scissors themselves are smaller, as one would expect kids scissors to be.  The scissors are comfortable to use.  They are not flimsy at all.  They feel solid and well built.  The size and design is great for kids, but they are also surprisingly comfortable for me to use for quick cutting jobs.  They have become quite a hit with my children as they feel they have their own scissors to use.  Having a dedicated place to store their scissors really seems to encourage them to put them away.  Most importantly, since we got this set, the children quit using and misplacing our grown-up scissors.Personally, I think this is a wonderful set and if you have children or a group of children, I think this is a great purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GOWMEMD2F6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PMG79K#wasThisHelpful","R24GOWMEMD2F6C","A3PE884TA8529G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE884TA8529G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on many glowing reviews here, I chose this mount. It is for a 47"" LED, weighing about 30 pounds. The bracket itself is quite heavy and benefits from having two people install. As long as you know where your studs are, installing is easy. The included lag bolts hold this tight! Leveling adjustments on the mount itself allow for slightly ""oopsed"" installs (although using a level makes life much easier). The mount folds fairly flat to the wall and allows for a considerable distance away from the wall. The tilt feature is something we needed as we wanted the mount high enough to see across the basement, but still be able to watch comfortably from a couch. Tilt adjustment is quick and doesn't require any tools.The metal is heavy gauge steel and will last a long time. I don't foresee any sagging issues as mentioned with other more cheaply made mounts. The HDMI cable included was a nice bonus as I did wind up needing it. (picture and audio work fine..didn't test for 3D functions as I don't have a 3D TV on this mount). Highly recommend this quality product.

"I purchased this to extend the range of my verizon DSL router. Setup was not too difficult and I was up in running in a fairly short period of time. After testing it out from various locations in my house, it wind out up not really adding much range to my network. There was a slight improvement, but not enough to warrant keeping the router. I also wound up having issues with my DSL connection and soon after switched to cable anyway, with a better range router included. Certainly, each home is different and you may have a better experience. I definitely enjoyed the user interface and easy setup. It was so much better than what I was used to with the DSL router/modem.

"This is my second pair of Fannings. My first pair have been in use for three summers and are still holding up fine. They are by far the most comfortable flip-flops I have ever owned for my flat feet. Most cheaply made flops make my feet hurt after moderate use. These have a much stronger support and sturdy design. Once broken-in, they are fantastic. Until that point, they are a bit tight and will hurt your feet a bit if you wear them too long one day.I wear mine almost every day during the late spring/summer and keep them on for the entire day usually. I'll even wear them to baseball games where I usually wind up standing for three hours or so.The bottle opener on bottom is certainly a cool feature and one that will get a few weird looks from time to time.I am glad to be able to get these on Amazon at a good price and in the color/size I want.

However, I lucked out with a coupon and 20% subscribe and save discount, which made them a good value. We love these paper towels though as many store brands do not compare (although, Target Up&Up paper towels are quite good). They are super-absorbent and don't fall apart into a linty mess like cheaper towels.

Imagine sitting on the couch with the fireplace going and mug of your favorite warm beverage...this is exactly the music you want playing.

The only feature missing from my old maker is an adjustable warming plate, but this is always hot enough for me (and I enjoy my coffee quite hot).  One feature I like with this maker is that the ""nozzle"" the water drips down from above the basket is built in. On my old coffeemaker, there was a separate piece of metal that often came loose and was cause the water to leak or miss the grinds, causing a wasted batch of coffee.

It is a near perfect match. In fact, I brought a piece of tile to the store to have them color match and that is exactly what the computer matched it to.

It's also nice to have some extras as screwdrivers always seem to get misplaced or are not around when you need them.

The following observations should help the amazon shopper:Good:1.  If you are using this text to brush up on CLEP/AP type tests, you will find it helpful.  It is heavy on the poets who have been most influential (Wordsworth, Blake, Spenser, Coleridge, etc).  You wouldn't need to read the whole book, obviously, but you get the idea.2. It does have an index. This might seem obvious but it is a necessary corrective to (~1; see below).Bad:1.  No table of contents.  They may have corrected this in other editions (though I've checked a few and it is missing).  This is literally worse than useless.  How exactly are you to find your favorite poem?

"Jaegwon Kim offers a weakened physicalist discussion of supervenience and the difficulties it presents for current alternatives to Mind-Body dualism.  There is some technical language but it is kept at a minimum.  Of primary importance is Kims remarkably lucid discussion of supervenience.Supervenience tries to explain how mental properties and physical kinds, not tokens, are related. Mental properties supervene on physical properties: For any property M, if anything has M at time t, then there exists a physical base (subvenient) property P such that it has P at t, and necessarily anything that has P at  a time has M at that time (Kim 9).  This means every mental property has a physical base that guarantees its instantiation (10). Thus, mental properties supervene on physical properties.  The takeaway is that mental properties must always have a physical base.  This is an improvement on older materialist models which said mental properties were physical properties.Supervenience presents a number of problems for physicalism, however.  What happens if mental property M causes another mental property M* to be instantiated? For example, my having the state anger causes me to have the mental state depression/fear/whatever.  This means that, if supervenience holds, M* must also have a physical property P* as its physical base.  Two problems immediately arise:a.  It appears that a mental property (M) is causing a physical base (P*) which then launches M*.  Yet reductionists hold that all things have a physical cause.  But this raises the problem:b.  So what causes M*?  It seems we have multiple causes, overdetermination.Kim restates the problem:  if mental properties are physically irreducible and remain outside the physical domain, then, given that the physical domain is causally closed, how can they exercise causal powers (Kim 58)?ConclusionIn terms of an introductory text, albeit a rigorous one, I highly recommend this book.  Admittedly, Kim doesnt solve the problem (cf. p. 58), nor does he pretend to.  He introduces the reader to the relevant terminology and explains why certain moves available to physicalists cannot work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R223PPCBQVYLJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262611538#wasThisHelpful","R223PPCBQVYLJS","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been said that of the many casualties in a tragedys body count, the future is one of them.  In Shakespeares tragedies, characters may wax upon the coming events, but they are of no importance.  Not so in his histories.  Therefore, in this story, we can advance the thesis that monarchy is an anti-tragedy.The king has two bodies, as Kantorowicz famously argued.  There is the body of the king, which can die, but the kings body politic which outlasts his death.  Admittedly, Richard is a weak king but Richards power and dignity survive his death. Or perhaps, like Charles I later on, he gains dignity in death.  The important point is that in Shakespeares history, especially in this play, life does go on after Act V.And life doesnt end with Richards own ending.  The reader is very much interested in what happens next--something not usually said about a tragedy.As far as Shakespeares plays go, this is an easier one.  The minor plots dont detract from the story, unlike in other plays.  And Shakespeare keeps Richards character rather complex.  We know he is probably guilty of Gloucesters murder, or implicated anyway, but he does act nobly towards the end, if somewhat pathetically throughout the play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8M85T0PM5NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451527194#wasThisHelpful","R3V8M85T0PM5NM","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mind-body problem is not just a local problem within the human person.  Rather, the answers to this question are analogous to the entire cosmos.  Nagel asks, Can a Darwinian naturalist account explain the phenomenon of mind, consciousness, reason and value?  Can we integrate the concept of Mind within a modern outlook (Nagel 8)?He states the problem:  whatever explains the existence of organisms must also explain the existence of mind (14). Most of the book is a survey of how Neo-Darwinian Naturalism fails to explain why and the like.  Throughout he echoes challenges by Plantinga and others: If two faculties in us are both natural, why should we privilege our belief-forming mechanism to correct other cognitive faculties (28).  He doesnt say it here (though he does later), this is the problem of value.  How does a purely natural account posed in the problem above explain value-judgments?His section on consciousness was a bit weaker. He argues that naturalism cant account for mental phenomena that is evident from the first person inner point-of-view of the conscious subject (38).  I agree but I dont think Nagel gives the strongest argument.  For a better treatment consult Moreland and Swinburne, especially the latters Evolution of the Soul.Criticisms*Nagel says substance dualism leaves biology with many unanswerable questions (49n12). So what if it does?  If Nagel holds to this criticism, then its hard to see exactly how his position differs from naturalism at the end of the day.* As critics have noted, Nagel rejects naturalism but he also rejects theism of any form (and with it, mind-body dualism).  As such, he hasnt given us anything resembling a coherent alternative.  Its like he is a naturalist gadfly.  By still insisting on a biological/physical account of everything, he hasnt really moved beyond naturalism--certainly he hasnt moved beyond it given that he also rejects theism.ConclusionNagel has advanced important criticisms of naturalism.  One hopes that the Regime will take these criticisms seriously and remove naturalism from its vaunted pedestal where it is politically immune to any criticism.  With that said, Nagel offers nothing in terms of an alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZIQZGZ5FGZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199919755#wasThisHelpful","R3IZIQZGZ5FGZ5","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book should be read as a prelude to his Renovation of the Heart. Thesis:  God is inviting us to kingdom living right now. Willard spends some time critiquing dispensational outlooks that relegate Jesuss kingdom message, especially the sermon on the mount, to the Millennial Age.  (Substitute millennial reign for kingdom in the Sermon on the Mount.  Hilarity ensues).He defines Gods kingdom as the range of his effective will (Willard 25), allowing us to pray for his kingdom to come on earth as in heaven.  Further, God has given each of us a kingdom, which is the range of our own will.The HeavensThe heavens are the direct experience and presence of Gods person, knowledge, and power to those who serve and trust him (67). In NT language, to be born from above is to be interactively joined with a dynamic, unseen system of divine reality in the midst of which all humanity moves (68).  Willard then gives us a metaphysical feast on the nature of the soul and spiritual reality (67-81).Following the discussion on the heavens and kingdom, Willard gives an exposition on the sermon on the mount.  After that he goes into the ""disciplined life.""  In other words, I must be Jesus' student.  If I am to be someones apprentice, I must be with him (276).  The disciples were engulfed by the Spirit. The kingdom of the heavens, from a practical point of view, is simply our experience of Jesus continual interaction with us in history and throughout the days, hours, and moments of our earthly existence (280).Definition: a discipline is any activity that enables us to do what we cannot do by direct effort (353). Spiritual disciplines are designed to help us withdraw from our own efforts and depend on kingdom power.  Ironically, all spiritual disciplines involve the body.The Future WorldThe cosmos are open to God.  In the eschaton we will reign with God as kings and priests (Ex. 19.6; Rev. 5.10).  The intention of God is that we should each become the kind of person whom he can set free in his universe, empowered to do what we want to do (379).really knowing: when we pass through death we see the world as it is for the first time (392).  When we move into the presence of eternity, as Paul had sometimes been, we will have the same kind of fullness and clarity of experience as those beings now have.  The spiritual realm is the realm of truth, not distortion. The biblical language of death as sleep applies to the body, not the person (and they are not the same thing). Jesus body is not restrained by space, time, and physical causality (395).  In Gods universe matter is subjected to mind or spirit.Near Death Experiences: the person transitions to see the invisible (397).  He might even interact with deceased close ones.  He, if in Christ, will be borne away by angels (Lk. 16.22).Overall:Something ""clicked"" in me midway through this book and I can honestly say I was ""changed.""  I don't think the book is as polished or focused as his later *Renovation of the Heart,* but it does contain several fine meditation on how we might experience heaven and also on the disciplines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336V1P3Q2IUGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060693339#wasThisHelpful","R336V1P3Q2IUGW","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dostoevsky gives us a warning of Two Russias--one dominated by pride, usury, and urban values and the other by the Old Russia.The idiot himself is a parable of Russia.  How will Russia respond to Russia? Dostoevsky offers Prince Myshkin for redemption to  the Russian soul. We see several responses:Nihilism and Liberalism (and Dostoevsky implies that the latter must always reduce to the former).The Bureaucracy.  This is manifested by St Petersburg.Holy Russia.  Dostoevsky makes clear he is following--at least ideally--the Old Believers prior to the Nikonian schism.The book offers several internal structuresA  Party at Nastasyas  1.

"PVI (pagination from the 2009 edition) sets out to defend the Common Western Metaphysic:  basically the common-sense view in the west that there is a ready-made, external world independent of our mind.  This text is divided into three parts: The Way the World is, Why the World Is, and the Inhabitants of the World.Throughout he covers all of the basic problems and terminology in metaphysics today: inviduation, externality, objective realism, free will, mind-body problem, etc.He covers the Ontological argument, albeit in its modal form (from Plantinga and others).In terms of the mind-body problem, PVI is critical of dualism and opts for a physicalist approach.  He does admit that physicalism (i.e., all properties of a person, mental and non-mental, are simply physical properties) is hard-pressed to overcome the problem of identity (see Ship of Theseus discussion).He gives a mostly good account of free will and defends incompatibilism.Conclusion:The book is very well-written and surprisingly easy to read.  It is accessible to the Beginner-Intermediate student.  As for criticisms of the book, I am not persuaded that PVI fully dealt with Leibnizs charge about a physical thing thinking. He says the dualist must likewise own up to the mystery of a non-physical thing (e.g., God) thinking (221). I dont see how this is a problem for the dualist.  The dualist isnt bound to think of physical explanations for everything like the physicalist is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSCPJE3RULBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813349346#wasThisHelpful","R2JSCPJE3RULBR","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Averky saw our age as Age of Apostasy, as the final preparation for the man of sin (Rose 19).Basic Hermeneutical Principles (these are from Rose, not Averky)As history proceeds to the end, the meaning of some of these symbols will become clearer (Rose 31).The most correct commentary is the one that unites all these approaches, keeping in mind, as the ancient commentators and Fathers of the church clearly taught, the content of the Apocalypse in its sum is indeed directed to the last part of the history of the world (Averky 54).Averky tentatively suggests (but does not finally endorse) the idea that the churches are seven epochs (101ff):The GoodAverky stood in the tradition of the fathers and passed down the faith.  This is a reliable, if sometimes lightweight, commentary on the Apocalypse. He helpfully summarizes each section and offers Scripture parallels at the end of each chapter.Possible Criticisms (It might seem like I offer a lot of criticisms, but this shouldn't take away from the book's inestimable value).*We see numerous references and exhortations that we seek out the commentaries of the Holy Fathers (Rose 27) to avoid Protestant errors, but besides Andrew of Caesarea we are almost never given any specific references.  Averky does list some Russian-language resources (Averky 39-40).*As a general rule, Averky doesnt engage in exegesis (neither did St Andrew, for the most part).*Averky says Protestants deny the necessity of good deeds for final salvation (201, Comm. 14:13).  This is not true, nor is it clear exactly whom he has in mind.  Classical Protestantism denies good deeds as the grounds or foundation of our salvation.  We affirm good deeds as necessary for the final telos of our salvation.  We can even say that good deeds are the final cause of our salvation, just not the material, efficient, or instrumental causes.*Averky sees the thousand-year period as Christianitys victory over paganism.  The only problem with this interpretation is that the opening phrase of Revelation 20 sees it sequential with the events of Revelation 19.  Averky says that the Illuminati held to chiliasm (256).  He criticizes Chiliast belief but doesnt seem to take into account that premillennialists get their teaching from the passage itself, which does say two resurrections (however that term is glossed).He says that Chiliasm teaches two or three comings of Christ, but this isnt necessarily true.  A premillennialist can quite logically hold to the following timeline:  1st coming in humility, 2nd coming following the slaying of Antichrist with the breath of His mouth, the raising of the pious dead while the impious sleep, and then a final resurrection.  But note that the final stage of the resurrection doesnt logically demand another coming.The problem with identifying Chiliasm with modern historic premillennialism is that the latter doesnt see an ending to the millennial kingdom.  It simply states, with Scripture, that Christ hands this kingdom over to the Father (1 Cor. 15:24).*His argument in the appendix Neo-Chiliasm threatens to come undone.  He begins with a fine critique of Ecumenism, but he errs in saying that Neo-Chiliasts want to have this world and do not like Scriptures warning of its destruction.  Well, modern ecumenists probably dont like passages about the worlds destruction, but they probably dont like any passage from the Bible.  The modern premillennialist, however, sees that God will create a new heavens and a new earth, so we are not warranted in seeing a complete destruction of the earth.Normally chiliasts are incorrectly lumped with premillennialists, who are quite conservative and anti-liberal.  Yet most of his criticisms seemed aimed at the unbelievers in the World Council of Churches.  In any case he never identifies who these Neo-Chiliasts are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5NGZ0VG1QYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0938635670#wasThisHelpful","R1M5NGZ0VG1QYQ","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you remember Mystery Science Theater 3000?  It's where Joel and the ""bots"" would riff B-movies.  Well, the first half of this volume is kind of like that. While Severian of Gabala had some insights, he had trouble with coherently finishing a sermon on point.  And the editor (Robert Hill) lets you know that in the footnotes. And the footnotes are a laugh-riot.  Here are some examples:""Severian feels that he has done justice to the Genesis account of the first day and that he has achieved profundity.  The goodness of creation has escaped his attention, however"" (Hill 30 n44).""He [Severian] is going to great trouble to vindicate all the details of the Genesis account instead of leaving it be and moving on"" (41 n16).""Again Severian has made a rod for his own back by being aggressively literalistic"" (50 n13).Obviously, Severian is no John Chrysostom but he is not without use.  While it's easy to ridicule Severian for his flat-earth cosmology, he perceptively ties it's dome-like structure to the tabernacle-imagery.  As modern scholars now realize, the Mosaic Tabernacle was a microcosm of the universe (Beale 2004: 189).  But does this entail a belief in flat-earth cosmology?  Not necessarily.  The earth is flat and heliocentric from an observational point of view (like using phrases as ""sunrise"").Bede the Venerable is a different class of commentator.  He is the opposite of Severian: focused, mature, and restrained.  His actual commentary is more or less a riff off of Augustine's work on Genesis.  Bede adds to the discussion with his Six Ages of Man.  Rather than allegorical excess, Bede gives a profound typology, as seen below.>>Age 1: From the Fall to the Flood (p. 135). The The end of Day 1 anticipates the Waters of day 2, so at the end of Age 1 is the Flood.Age 2:  Day 2 is about the waters of the flood, so the second age sees humanity in the ark.  The end of this day sees the nations of Genesis 10 (70 = nations, figuratively).Age 3: Day 3 has the dry earth and vegetation appearing, so Age 3 sees the dry earth after the Flood.  Also the calling of Abraham, which is the separation of the faithful from the unfaithful.  Also typologically anticipates Israels casting off the Law and the defiling in slavery.  Ends in King Saul.Age 4: On Day 4 the heaven receives its luminaries.  In the 4th age we see the Kingly lights of David and Solomon.  As the day turns towards evening, this age turned toward darkness and ended in Babylon (p.136).Age 5:  Day 5 sees the waters bringing forth fish.  Bede sees Babylon as meaning waters, so the children of Israel are living in the waters of Babylon.Age 6:  God created man on Day 6.  In age 6 the New Man, the Word of God.  The Church (Eve) is taken from his rib.  Antichrist will appear in the evening of this day.  This evening will be darker than the rest (p. 137).  After Antichrists appearing will be the Tribulation.<<","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W23RXAD07H95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830829075#wasThisHelpful","R3W23RXAD07H95","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kraft joins a host of Evangelical scholars (Moreland, Willard, Grudem, Storms) who are admitting the Spirit's power being manifested in the kingdom today yet are doing so from non-Pentecostal platforms.  In this work Kraft summarizes past arguments, responds to recent criticisms, and offers models and templates on how to engage in deliverance ministry.  Kraft makes the provocative argument that there are regularities, rules, and principles in the relationships between the human world and the spirit world exist and can be studied scientifically (61; I wish Kraft would have said systematically instead of scientifically).*Dealing with Demons*Kraft suggests that demons attach themselves to damaged emotions (at least part of the time) and many exorcisms, if they don't go wrong, are protracted longer than necessary because the exorcist isn't dealing with root-level issues.  This seems to work more with ""sin-issue"" demons more than institutional or territorial spirits.Kraft has come under attack for claiming we can make systematic studies of the spirit world.  Perhaps he is sometimes guilty of overreach, but there does seem to be something there.  He notes that Gods universe has rules and order.  From this premise he infers that the spirit-realm also operates by an order.  He gives seven principles that guide his work (108-110).  Kraft has been accused of animism, seeing power in objects and rituals. Kraft responds by noting that animists have relatively correct logical principles; they simply misunderstand how God works (112).He notes a number of ""rules"" that he has seen work in deliverance ministries (see pp. 162ff).  He does a good job noting the various hierarchies within the spirit realm.Conclusion:This book does a fine job breaking open new paradigms and the differences between animism and biblical supernaturalism.  I do have some criticisms:  Kraft is correct in that synergy is a key point in intercession and deliverance, but he lends himself to overstating the case (God cant work without partners, 151).  *Kraft utilizes Free Will  as an interpretive model but doesnt actually define it (152).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VD2JNPAEZKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800793145#wasThisHelpful","R3VD2JNPAEZKP","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goetz and Talifero (GT) defend the thesis that we are embodied souls (GT 4), that our soul is not identifiable with our brain, and that dualism does not imply a denigration of matter but is merely a shorthand way of saying that body and soul/mind are different.  They cover familiar ground as found in history of philosophy texts, yet they also call attention to problems raised by modern neuroscience.  This book is fairly lucid, contains some technical terminology, and is accessible to the intermediate level reader.  Typos, formatting quirks, and introduction of new material at the end mar the book's otherwise exceptional content.Not surprisingly, GT begins with Plato and Greece.  They call special attention to the problem of motion (that which can move itself is the most powerful mover) and the soul's intrinsic nature.  GT note difficulties in Plato's account:  if the soul is simple, how can Plato speak of parts?  Later reflection by Aristotle changed ""parts"" to ""powers of the soul"" and removed the difficult.The next treatment is on Augustine and Aquinas.  GT notes Augustine's anticipation of Descartes's rebuttal of skepticism: I can doubt x, but I cannot doubt the appearing-to-me of x).They next survey Continental and British reflection on the soul, with special attention given to Descartes.  With regard to the Brits and Scots, most of the treatment concerns the various rebuttals and improvements to Locke.ConclusionIn terms of scholarship the book is quite fine.  There are numerous typos and strange formatting at the beginning of each chapter.

"St Andrew of Caesareas commentary on the Apocalypse is the first substantial Eastern reflection on the Apocalypse as a whole.  Earlier saints like Methodios and Cyril of Jerusalem gave pointed exhortations, and Andrew is in line with their conclusions.  What makes Andrews work important in the history of Christian thought is a) he is working independently of Augustines City of God and b) he is the first to offer a non-premillennial stance on Revelation 20.  True, earlier writers had rejected premillennialism, but few gave a systematic analysis of Revelation 20.Andrew probably wrote around 610, just before the Islamic invasions. He could not have written before 564, since the lists of bishops of Caesarea is complete (until then) and he isnt mentioned.  InterpretationThe Spirit inspired the text in a tripartite manner according to the tripartite structure of man (Introduction, xxvi, 116).The body of scripture/story is the literal meaning, sense-referent.the tropological meaning = the soulspirit = anagogical meaning of higher things to come, the kingdom of God.Andrew further divides Revelation into 24 books corresponding to the 24 elders.Andrew's reading of the 5 (+2) kings in Rev. 17 was particularly helpful. Concerning 20:1-3.  The destruction of Satan occurred at Christs Passion.  Andrew rejects a literal 1,000 years (189).  He says it is the time of the Incarnation until the arrival of Antichrist.  Interestingly, this is not a pure amillennialism, for Andrew does not see it as synonymous with the whole church age. Weinrich in a footnote (189 n22) links this position with Augustine and the West, but this is not entirely the case.He has a fine reading of 20:4.  The teaching thrones were given to the holy apostles who enlightened the nations.  He connects these enlighteners with martyrs primarily, but also including pious kings (190).  Indeed, the kings demonstrate their power against demonic activity.  This is indeed born out in history, as we see with the Tsar-martyr Nicholas II.As to Oecumenius, his commentary is markedly inferior to Andrew's, although he did provide the foundation for Andrew.  He has a few interesting insights, though much of his commentary is hampered by his Miaphysite need to prove that miaphysites aren't Christological heretics.  Oecumenius divides his work into 12 sections, not 24.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HZIUCM28S6KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830829083#wasThisHelpful","R2HZIUCM28S6KT","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you cross Jerome's brutal satire with JND Kelly's dry wit, the result is overwhelming.  Jerome's gifts were in style and work ethic and not really in profound thought.  Even where he is atrociously wrong, he cannot help but be entertaining.Jerome struggled with the passions and he hints some of those were sexual in nature (cf Letter 22.7).  Unlike other monks who engaged in more bodily deprivations, Jerome found deliverance in learning a new language:  Hebrew (Kelly 50, quoting letter 125).Besides his translations and commnetaries, Jerome's key legacy to the church is his collection of letters.  In them we see his response to a wide variety of pious practices.  And Jerome's response is usually the same: study Scripture, commit to celibacy, and if you aren't on his good side, you get called names.  It's funny, though.Other aspects of his life were tragic.  The fallout with Rufinus was unnecessary, since neither of the men held to Origen's heresies and both of the men acknowledged his spirituality.This book isn't as key as Kelly's bio on Chrysostom, simply because Chrysostom is a much more important individual.  Still, a wonderful biography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLJ57Z91WMWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060643331#wasThisHelpful","RCLJ57Z91WMWL","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flow and HighlightsI will capture the flow of Gregorys life along with crucial highlights.  McGuckins thesis suggests something along the lines that Gregory midwifed a new Christian vision into the old imperium.Gregorys Post-Hellenic VisionGregory opted for something like a Christian Hellenism, or rather the New Byzantine vision (I understand this language is somewhat anachronistic, since Gregory would have seen himself as a Roman).  This method and vision allowed him to bring order to a then inchoate biblical theology.  It was a bridge between the Hellenic and Semitic worlds.  He was able to hold apparent opposites in creative tensions, and he refused to collapse mystery and symbol into logical deduction (McGuckin10).  In fact, in Gregorys hands Christology is never allowed to escape its proper context of reflection: the dynamic mystery of the economy of Gods salvation of humankind (390).In order to counteract Julian, Christians had to offer an inspiration for a new imperium and society (117ff).  Both Gregory and Julian agreed that a culture cannot be divorced from its religious inspiration without being fatally compromised. In this battle Gregory forges a keen anti-Hellenic apologetics.  Much of it is similar to Augustine, albeit with the promise that Christianity is able to synthesize old and new (121).Indeed, the birth of Byzantium is the new public confession of the Spirit as homoousion.  Gregorys confession of the Spirit is the positive triumph of what was best in Origen: it is the present spiritualization of the current order and the ascent to divine vision (309).  Gregory is able to do what his master could not:  correlate the eschatological vision with historical unfolding. Gregorys social program is connected with his anthropology (151).  Image and archetype are reconciled in the hominisation of God as a poor man.  The human condition is mixis between clay and divine image.Theological MethodThis is not merely an attack on Eunomios.  It is a vision for theology (263).  He attacks two theological positions:  a) that the Son and Spirit are without cause (agenetos); and b) they are caused by the Father as something other (hetera) to him.principle of causality:  it is something other than what is meant by Gods causing the created order.  It indicates the manner in which the Father relates his being to the other two persons.Feasting in the SpiritThe doctrine of the Spirit is the mean between Jewish monism and Hellenic polytheism (273).  Jews celebrate feasts by the letter, Greeks in the body.  Christians feast in the Spirit.  As McGuckin notes, this fits in with Gregorys matrix of liturgical discourse.It is through the Spirit that the Father is known and the Son glorified.  The idiomata do not define the essence, but are themselves defined in relation to the essence. The three stages of revelation are progressively perfected.Conclusion:This is a hard read.  And it is not quite the same ""kind"" of work as McGuckin's masterpiece on Cyril.  The latter is a theological commentary; this, as the subtitle makes clear, is an intellectual biography.  Still, McGuckin's scholarship is world-class and this is easily the best biography on Gregory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPYDXD5TTKPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881418641#wasThisHelpful","R2XPYDXD5TTKPJ","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"St Cyril of Alexandria is the sphragidis of the Fathers, the seal of the Fathers. While he is not the last word in Christology, he was an able summarizer of Christological thought and was remarkably consistent. Hes also disliked among academics today. St Cyril played hardball and it seemed like he used unsavory means to keep heretics from being represented at Council.Prof McGuckin dismantles these myths. McGuckin a) exposes the postmodern and elitist presuppositions of the university professors and b) offers a different angle on the Nestorian Controversyand he does it with dash, flair, and humor.To be fair, though, it is difficult to know exactly what Nestorius actually believed. Nestorius was accused of maintaining there were two persons in Christ, a position he seemed to deny. Yet McGuckin makes clear that Nestorius believed in two prosopon in Christ. This word can mean person but doesnt always, and that appeared to give Nestorius an out. Yet as McGuckin and St Cyril make clear, Nestorius nonetheless held to two operating principles in Christ. (At this point McGuckin gives a long summary of Nestoriuss Christology. In short, it reads: Extreme divine impassibility: the Logos cannot suffer (131). Christs two natures remain ontologically apart, existing side by side (135). The Churchs confession of Christ should always begin with his double reality (156).On pp. 138ff McGuckin gives a helpful summary of the meanings of ousia, physis, hypostasis, and prosopon.Cyrils ChristologyBefore examining St Cyrils Christology, McGuckin surveys Apolloniariuss Christology. While denounced as a heretic (and rightly so), Apollonaris put his finger on many important points. To put it another way, while Apollonariss heresy was bad, it set the stage for Cyrils triumph. Apollonaris saw the important point that had to be maintained: the single subject of the Logos (179).Redemptive DeificationSt Cyrils Christology was tied to his soteriology: The incarnation was a restorative act designed for the ontological reconstruction of a human nature that had fallen into existential decay as a result of its alienation from God (184). The Logos appropriates human natureand this human nature becomes that of one who is Godthe human nature is lifted up to extraordinary glory.St Cyril also offers us a way to think about divine impassibility: we should see the intimacy of the connection between the two realities of ChristIn the incarnation the power of the one transforms and heals the fallibility of the other.The human nature is conceived as the manner of action of an independent and omnipotent powerthat of the Logos; and to the Logos alone can be attributed the authorship of, and responsibility for, all its actions (186). The subject is unchanged, but that subject now expresses the characteristics of his divinely powerful condition in and through the medium of a passible and fragile condition.Of course, St Cyril ties this in with the holy mysteries (188). The believer is deified because the encounter brings him into life-giving proximity with the Logosand this proximity was the metaphysical root of all being.St Cyrils vision was the transformation of the human race according to the paradigm of divine appropriation of a human nature in the incarnation (188).The Ecumenical Reception of St CyrilCyril preferred to say that Christ was of two natures, placing the stress on the Incarnation (231).McGuckin scores major points in noting that St Leos Tome actually had to pass muster before it was excepted. The Church didnt merely receive it and note, Leo has spoken. The end. They said this, but only after it passed a Cyrillene test. Why did they praise Leo? Because his Tome agreed with Cyril and the Fathers, not merely because he was pope.ConclusionThis was a fantastic book. It is truly one of the great books written on Christology. Because of the timeline it does not deal with later concerns about the energies and wills of Christ. However, it wonderfully ties in ecclesiology, Christology, soteriology, and the Eucharist into one prism which then sheds multi-perspectival light on the Church.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NGH2GXK0SG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881418633#wasThisHelpful","R1NGH2GXK0SG5P","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beeley's work represents an interesting advance on previous patristic studies. He challenges long-held models on how to interpret different Christological interpretations. His works is thoroughly documented and covers every major Christological figure. I think he overshoots his case at the end and does not interact with challenges to his own viewpoint.Part of his thesis is to rehabilitate Origen. For all of Origen's fatal flaws, few of his earlier followers really had the reaction to him that we have today. Nor did they even think of challenging the ""grammar"" of his Christology. This leads to another part of Beeley's thesis: The Alexandrian school was far more dualist than is commonly thought. This is seen in their surprising use of the communicatio idiomata. For all of the Alexandrian rhetoric of ""God in the womb/God in the tomb,"" they always qualified it to mean that the divine nature really didn't suffer.For our purposes Origen's Christology is the Son as mediator of the divine knowledge (he mediates the Father's utter simplicity).As in Origen, so in Eusebius. Beeley correctly argues that Eusebius was not the closet Arian that people make him out to be. The problem was the term ""ousia"" connoted physical ideas. Given those ideas, if one said the two were of the same ousia, then it seemed you were saying they were ""physical"" or had no differentiating characteristics (and it is cheating to read later uses of ""hypostasis"" back into it). Beeley marshals enough quotations to say that while Eusebius is problematic, he is okay.Beeley has a controvesial section on Athanasios. Continuing with his dualist motif, he suggests that Athanasios is not the Alexandrian you think he is. He, like virtually every ancient thinker, held to the divine impassibility of the Word. Coupled with the communicatio, this means that ""suffering"" is predicated of the person, not the Word.Gregory of Nazianzus represents a supreme advance on all previous Christology. Gregory sees Christ's divine identity in dynamic, narrative terms (185). Interestingly, Gregory sees perichoresis as emphasizing, not the unity, but the distinctions (Beeley 189, cf. Ep. 101.20-21).Beeley then contrasts Western thinkers with earlier Eastern ones. His conclusions aren't all that surprising from earlier works, so I won't deal with them here.Criticisms:1. I don't think he did full justice to Athanasios. He also said Athanasios held to a demi-urge view of creation (128). It all depends on how Demiurge is being used.  Gregory and others used it, but not in the Platonic sense. Yes, Athanasios held that the world was made through the Son, but not in the Platonic demiurge fashion.2. He dealt with some figures all too briefly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGMND1VIDU03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030017862X#wasThisHelpful","R3UGMND1VIDU03","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gerolymatos argues that the Kosovo myth functions as a prism through which Serbia would forever understand its struggles with outsiders (Gerolymatos 8).  He makes the neat argument that even after the Battle of Kosovo and the death of Holy Prince Lazar, Serbs and Greeks had numerous opportunities to annihilate the Ottomans.  That wouldn't be true if Kosovo were indeed the final point of medieval Serbian independence.Ottoman Era: Creating a MythologyThe sack of Constantinople ended a universal Hellenism and began to create a specifically Greek consciousness (69-70).He argues that the Ottoman rule actually made the Greek Church (better called the Phanariot Church) more powerful.  Other Orthodox jurisdictions temporarily disappeared, leaving the Phanariot Patriarch as Patriarch over all the East (Russia excluded).  Indeed, the Patriarch assumed the role of a vizier.  Of course, it also made the Patriarchate dependent on the Sultan for its survival (sort of throws a new light on the Caesaropapism charge).Most importantly, no matter how brutal the Ottomans were (and he doesnt pull punches), there was always collusion between between Muslim and Christian (81).  This is best illustrated in the person of Ali Pasha, the Ottoman strongman who was by far the most interesting persona in the book.  Pashas life represents the problem of the Balkans: he exploited divisions and weaknesses to make himself more powerful.  This meant, ironically, defending and strengthening some Christian communities (if only to weaken his Ottoman rivals).Modern FailuresAmong the many reasons modern Western politicians fail to understand the Balkan crisis is the critical role of land (167).  Men die and identify themselves for what they believe in, who they are, and where they are--and not for pious platitudes chanted on CNN.One key failure, perhaps earlier than the Modern period, was the Great Powers ignoring of Macedonia.  According to the author, Macedonia was a microcosm of the Balkans and a strategic pathway for all cardinal directions (207).  The Powers gave it back to the Ottoman Empire without regard for future upheavals.He sees economic success as the only way to combat the fatigue of war (245).  Time will tell.ConclusionsI enjoyed the endnotes almost as much as anything else in the book.  They were a veritable bibliographic feast.  If you read this book you will know infinitely more political science than the news anchors on CNN.Criticisms:Some of these criticisms might seem overly nitpicky, but thats only because this book is so good and well-written.*He notes that the Koran said a city that did not surrender would be subject to three days of pillaging (253 n2).  I dont dispute that, but where is that referenced?*He is more or less fair in his handling of Kosovo. He acknowledges Milosevic engaged in cruelties but points out Americas own role in intervening: a) establishing an anti-Russian, anti-Serb state in the heart of the Balkans, b) conveniently allowing transit to Western and Central Asia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMROI8XWNZ208/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465027326#wasThisHelpful","RMROI8XWNZ208","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike other volumes in these SVS series, this is not a collection of these fathers teachings.  It is rather 4 mini-biographies which includes their teachings.  The translator/editors introductions are patristic gold mines.  While these fathers, for example, cannot simply be tagged with Origens teachings, they are understood in something of an Origenist framework, a framework which would have major repercussions on St John Chrysostom.The sections on Evagrius and Macarius of Egypt were particularly good in explaining knowledge and spiritual warfare as it regards demons.  And while these fathers were great ascetics, they did acknowledge they made mistakes and sometimes took it too far.Another strength is the footnotes.  Tim Vivian (the editor) connects the Desert Fathers teachings with key passages from The Life of Antony and Cassians Conferences.  Thats where the real gold lies.In conclusion I highly recommend this volume.

"How does an academic Englishman write a biography on a church father and make it read like a soap opera at times?  I don't know, but JND Kelly does it.  Kelly tells the story of Chrysostom's upbringing in Antioch, his development as a monk, then a preacher and finally as an exiled bishop.  The most important moment in Chrysostom's life was the arrival of the Tall Brothers, which began a series of events that resulted in his dying in exile.Kelly addresses several controversial aspects.  Was Chrysostom really an anti-semite?  No.  His remarks on the Jews, while unfortunate today, would have applied to any counter-religious group, Christian or otherwise.  He saw his sheep defecting to Judaism and so preached a series of sermons rebutting Judaism.  His language is extreme at times, but no different than any other preacher.The truly tragic aspect of his ministry was his relationship with Emperor Arkadia and Empress Eudoxia.  But more on that later.The Origenist Controversy:When Patriarch Theophilus exiled some Origenist monks for attacking more illiterate monks who held to Anthropomorphitism (e.g., God has a body), the monks, known as the Tall Brothers, came to Constantinople.  This was a problem. Origenism taught heretical views but not on this point.  Theophilius, patriarch of the most important city in the world, moved in for the kill.  One thing led to another, which also tied in with John's making enemies, and John found himself in exile.  He later returned and was later exiled again.Some notes from John's career:Johns Younger LifeTwo main influences:1. Julian the Apostates removal of the martyr Babylass relics (Kelly 9)2. Julians granting the Jews privileges to negate Christians.Married SexualityWhile John stays well within the Patristic orbit on sexual ethics for the Christian (i.e., better to remain single and celibate), he does occasionally strike new and healthier tones.  Patristic writers had long known they could not say married sex was bad.  That was Gnostic.  However, they did occasionally hint that the pleasure in sex was frowned upon and the point of sex was procreation.John says something new.  According to Kellys reading, It is the pleasure involved in the act, he emphasizes, which welds the two together; and even if no child results, the two still become one flesh (Kelly 134, quoting Chrysostom, In Col. hom. 12.5-6 (PG 62.388))ConclusionWhatever else you may say about Byzantium, no one has ever accused it of being boring.  JND Kelly is literally able to take church business meetings and give them ""spy flavor"" quality all the while maintaining that subtle British humor.This book's importance goes beyond itself.  Later historians of Origenism and Coptic Christianity (Tim Vivian) draw upon Kelly's analysis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SACMFXY7NAS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801485738#wasThisHelpful","R1SACMFXY7NAS8","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plantinga, summarizing his earlier work in The Nature of Necessity and God and Other Minds, demonstrates that the theist does not face a contradiction in a) asserting God exists and b) evil exists.  In this work Plantinga also deals with essences, persons, possible worlds, and logical analysis.  While Plantinga uses rigorous logic, this book is well-written and and fairly short.Is There a Logical Contradiction?If there is a contradiction between the following three premises, the atheologian has yet to show it:God is omnipotentGod is wholly goodEvil existsWe will call this Set {A}.  The atheologian has to show that one of these propositions denial or negation contradicts another proposition (Plantinga 13).  Even if the atheologian cannot show a logical contradiction, Plantinga will go on to argue that he cannot show a logical inconsistency (at least not on these three propositions.  By the end of the book all three of these are meticulously refined).The Free Will Defense (FWD) is the heart of Plantingas argument.  He argues that a person is free with respect to an action, a world containing free creatures is more valuable than a world without it, and to create free creatures capable of moral good is to create them capable of moral evil (29-31).Plantinga further clarifies classical theism by noting that an omnipotent God cannot create just any world.  God can only create logically possible worlds (or rather, God can only actualize logically possible states of affairs).  For example, God cannot actualize a state of affairs in which God didnt actualize any state of affairs.This leads to discussions of Possible Worlds (W).  W is a way things could have been.  It is an actual state of affairs that obtains.  A W is a possible state of affairs, but a possible state of affairs is not necessarily a W (35).Must Evil Exist?This is the trickiest part of the book.  Plantinga seems to imply yes at times (though to be fair that probably isnt his intention). Classical theism has always denied that evil is necessary. Plantinga calls his model Transworld Depravity: God cannot create a world in why my essential properties (E) mean I will be free and always do the right thing (48, 52).  I think Plantinga is correct but we need to change always to always compelled.Conclusion:This is the easiest of Plantinga's books to read.  And while the material is simpler, he does clarify points from *The Nature of Necessity.*  My only criticism is the second half on natural theology.  His arguments on Evil and Free Will Defense stand or fall independent of Natural Theology.  That section merely restated the material from *God and Other Minds.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8YL6I5SODUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802817319#wasThisHelpful","R2D8YL6I5SODUH","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oden heroically disregards modern theology's fear to speak about God.  In return he gives us a clean, lucid account of the classical Christian tradition, grounded in Scripture and the fathers with some attention to later writers.  Methdologically, this follows the first part of most Systematic theologies--Prolegomena and God.  There is a twist, though.  Oden gives the prolegomena after the doctrine of God.  There is a reason for this:  earlier accounts began with the subject of theological discourse, God, rather than our thoughts about God.Oden writes, "" Christian teaching has its external source in Gods self-disclosure, whose record is Scripture preserved, studied, and remembered by the living tradition, and its internal source in faith personally experienced and reasonably ordered (Oden 26).  Oden then follows with a classic exposition of who God is, with a helpful discussion on God's attributes, properties, relation to divine, and divine foreknowledge.Unique contributions:*Oden notes how classical writers focused on God's economy, which often isn't emphasized in modern theologies.*The Patristic citations are worth the price of the book.  This almost functions as a topical index to the fathers.Cons:*Oden more or less dodged the Filioque question.*While he had good points  on how Tradition functioned, he could have developed it more.Oden writes from a historical methodist position with regard to synergy, so one might expect disagreements there.  But it doesn't detract from the work.  It enhances it.  He invites us to a discussion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BCQM1ZEZEQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598560379#wasThisHelpful","R33BCQM1ZEZEQB","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thesis:  Until the late middle ages people looked at the world as a mystery (Boersma 21).  By mystery Boersma means a sacramental link between creation and God, that creation participates in God.  In other words, the connection, though not identical, is real.  Mystery, so Boersma reads the Platonist-Christian synthesis (hereafter PCs) refers to the reality behind the appearances.Boersma structures his book around the (neo)Platonic movement of exitus and reditus (the departure from and return to), except exitus now refers to how the church lost the PCs and the reditus on possible steps for regaining it.It is not Boersmas goal to defend Platonism as such.  Rather, he seeks to combat the ""antiheaven rhetoric among Evangelicals"" (187).For Boersma--and for the earlier Tradition--Created realities point beyond themselves (carry extra dimension to them). A Sacramental world not only points to God but participates in him.  The signum points to and participates in the res.  The end of created being lies beyond itself (30).The Fathers were able to weave a sacramental tapestry around Christ:  Christ contains the heavenly and creaturely universals in which we participate.  Our particular humanity depends on the participation of humanity in Christ (51).Sadly, this garment came unwound in the late middle ages with an increasing extrincisim of the Church.  Scripture and Tradition, Eucharist res and Eucharistic signum, were now be defined in opposition to one another.  With Occam and Scotus the unwinding became a cutting.  No longer was there a higher realm of being in which created being participated.  Rather, God and man were subsumed under the generic categor of being.How do we return (reditus)?  Boersma examines the implications of Henri de Lubac and the Nouvelle Theologie.  In their works we see  a real transubstantiation, but it is when the congregation is changed into the body of Christ. This leads de Lubac to posit a threefold body: the bread, the congregation, Christ.  Further, we see that sacramental time is when past, present, and future coincide (124). Chronological time thus opens up to eschatological time.  Thus, eschatological realities are able to enter into time (125). God inserts mystery into time. Earthly events become sacraments of eschatological mysteries. Time participates in Gods eternity.ConclusionThe painting, or tapestry rather, was awe-inspiring.  Boersma gives a convincing picture of how Platonism can be modified to serve Christianity.  One can question, of course, the finer points of his readings on Scotist, but it seems more or less accurate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283Q5VZ3V4DT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802865429#wasThisHelpful","R283Q5VZ3V4DT3","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ironically, or perhaps appropriately, this book is strong and weak in ways that Platonic ontology is strong and weak:  the chapters on universals and the soul are outstanding.  Getting to particular applications proved troubling for some authors.MetaphysicsThe authors demonstrate J.P. Morelands impassioned commitment to something akin to Platonic metaphysics.  There is a ready-made world consisting of natural classes of objects.  To use J.P.s euphonic phrase, Reality is cut at the joints.  Outlining JPs metaphysics would take to long. I refer the reader to the fine diagram on p. 24.Thus Paul Gould argues that such a belief in abstract objects is endorsing Platonism (of some variety or another, p. 21).  Several essays make similar claims--correctly, I think--but they never seem to get at the heart of reality:  Platonic forms have causal power.  To be sure, Gould and Wallace assert that Platonic properties structure reality, but dont develop that thought.Stewart Goetz summarizes JPs view of the soul: it is an immaterial substance that maintains identity through change, isnt reducible to the body and can exist independently, and the like.TruthThe next few essays summarize JPs epistemology, which is a mild foundationalism.ApologeticsA range of essays on natural theology, rational apologetics, and technology.  Of mixed value.and the ChurchSeveral fascinating essays on the Virtuous Life and empowering the church.  Much of it is a summary of Issler and Moreland, The Lost Virtue of Happiness.  Mike Erres essay is of particular importance:  he touches on the third leg of the Kingdom Triangle:  Spiritual Power. While it isnt a full defense of continuationism, he does have some good arguments:  Jesus said we would do greater works than him, and assuming we arent dying for the sins of the world, this must mean greater scope of work.  Which means Kingdom Power.ConclusionMost of the essays in this book are erudite and a few are technical.

"Even though Jennifer Leclaire isn't a professional theologian, and while I cringed at some of the exegesis, this book was surprisingly useful.  Before we begin we should clear the ground on naming principalities:(1) Is there a demonic entity known as ""Jezebel""?  I don't know.  I do think that there are demonic entities that exemplify the properties of Queen Jezebel and for lack of a better term we can call them ""Jezebel.""Leclaire's thesis is that Jezebel manifests as sexual temptation and rarely works alone.  Jezebel often works with the Spirit of Witchcraft and the Spirit of Religion (again, whether these are actual intelligences or a collective name is beside the point; I think they are a collective name).She gives sane advice for handling these spirits and often more important, simply identifying them.  What makes this book interesting is Leclaire's own life stories on this front.  She warns against seeing demons behind every bush but also offers the believer sound advice for confronting them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFJSTB484R9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080079589X#wasThisHelpful","R2LFJSTB484R9M","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is the allegory of Temperance.  It follows the standard medieval warrior pilgrimage.  Sumpter has done a fine job of modernizing the spelling while retaining the exalted style.  However, there are a few flaws with Sumpter's approach (I am not criticizing his work.  It is literally one of a kind and preciously needed).  Sumpter ignores (or doesn't notice) Spenser's Neo-Platonism.  Without understanding Spenser's commitment to Neo-Platonism, parts of the story are incoherent.  Here are some themes that will guide the reader.:Neo-Platonic ThemesReason masters passions:  Yet with strong reason mastered passions frail (VI.40).  But this isnt standard Neo-Platonism of the monkish sort.  Passions arent bad.  They just need to be guided by reason.*Mediating Spirits.  Neo-Platonism of its various forms sees a chain of being connecting all of reality.  The material is suspended by the spiritual.  Transcendence, therefore, can be found in the lowest link of the chain.  Along this chain are mediating spirits (powers, angels, fairies).*Because of his Neo-Platonism, Spenser sees a greater role for angels than we do today (VIII:1-2).  Angels actively engage and empower man and thwart the enemy.*It seems that Spenser identifies Temperance as a god (IX.1).  Granted, he isnt using god in the crude polytheistic sense.  Rather, temperance seems to be a power or even Archetype.  True, this could be merely poetic license, but given Spensers Neo-Platonism, it fits neatly.*In the Bower of Bliss the heroes (Guyon and Palmer) come across a false Genius.  If we accept that these characters (Genius et al) are Archetypes, we can then add the standard (neo)Platonic insight that the Archetypes and Forms have causal power.  But we have a problem.  The Genius here is a false Genius, as Spenser clearly argues (XII.47).  So clearly this Genius isnt the real genius, but a shadow one.Conclusion:Spensers work is literally the standard by which all other poetry is compared.  Even though (or perhaps because of!) he is a Neo-Platonist, Spenser floods the senses (and the soul) with beauty and creates in the reader a desire not only for the good, but for the Beautiful, for the Heroic--indeed, for the Temperate.This isnt accidental.  If what we have said about Forms/Archetypes having causal power, then then we can expect pullings upon our soul when reading Spenser.Spensers most memorable creation is the Bower of Bliss (as Lewis said, no prude can read Spenser).  Guyons actions represent a neat twist in Neo-Platonism.  The most temperate action is to go into a frenzy and destroy the Bower.  This isnt what we expect from a Neo-Platonist.  Spenser doesnt negate the passions--he calls them into Reasonss service, but all the while they remain very, very passional.  Spenser may have just squared the circle: he may have just redeemed Neo-Platonism.What about Sumpters annotations?  They are a mixed bag.  When Sumpter is explaining ethics, theology, or literary symbolism, his annotations are amazing.  When he tries to be funny they are worse than awful.  Remember the Ron Swanson style of humor?  If you have to try hard to be funny, you arent.  Hilarity should flow from your very being.  You shouldnt have to strain to be funny.  I say that because some of the wannabe funny footnotes seriously distract from the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASSFAJ3Y4DMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591280524#wasThisHelpful","R2ASSFAJ3Y4DMK","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It struck me while reading this that ""nonviolence"" is not the same thing as Pacifism.  The latter includes the former, certainly, but the latter has political connotations that the former does not.Wink suggests that ""nonviolence"" is a third way beyond Institutional Violence and Pacifism.  The former, argues Wink, represents the ""principalities and powers"" while Pacifism simply accepts the status quo, thus further strengthening the powers.  I think Wink's analysis of the situation is a bit simplistic, but he offers some unique insights on application.Wink rebuts crass readings of Jesus and Romans 13 that urge passivity.  In its context, true nonviolence ""provides a way to take on the system in a way that unmasks its essential cruelty and burlesque its pretensions to justice, law, and order"" (Wink 21).  In other words, we are to deprive the oppressor of a situation where force is effective.In short, Wink argues, quoting Ghandi, nonviolent revolution is a ""program transforming relationships, ending in a peaceful transfer of power"" (71).So what do we make of it?  In today's Big Brother state whose methods of warfare are simply beyond what we can fathom, any attempt at ""armed rebellion"" is essentially suicide.  Jesus knew that.  The apostles knew that.  Practically speaking, it is.  These principles of nonviolence allow for a way to deconstruct social situations that affirm the humanity of the Other, thus ending at and aiming for an ontology of peace.This sounds good on paper, as Wink is well aware of.  Most of the examples of nonviolence, while successful, were quite nervy.  Most people probably aren't up for that.This book is a marked improvement on Wink's earlier treatments, though with some shortcomings. To be sure, Wink acknowledges that Communists and Marxists have done terrible evils (he was noticeably silent in Unmasking the Powers on this point).  On the other hand, Wink continually rails against ""The Powers and Principalities,"" but we are never quite sure ""who"" these entities are.  I realize he covered that in his earlier volume, but he could have spent two more pages explaining it here.All in all, an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AA61NNFKSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800636090#wasThisHelpful","R11AA61NNFKSN","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brueggemann uses the Sabbath as a prism through which we understand economics and social relations and the ideological assumptions embedded in each.The demands of market ideology pertain as much to consumption as they do to production (Brueggemann xii).  It is Pharaohs insatiable script.Wherever YHWH governs as an alternative to Pharaoh, there the restfulness of YHWH effectively counters the restless anxiety of Pharaoh (xiii).Sabbath and the First CommandmentGod is embedded in a narrative and cannot be known outside that narrative (2).  The Sabbath commandment is drawn into the Exodus, whose narrative matrix is that of YHWH.The economics of Pharaoh:every socioeconomic system will be legitimized by some god (3).The system is designed to create endless surplus, and thus endless storerooms.it makes a fetish of the market.  The market generates a desire for commodities of a social value, making us want even more commodities, which takes on a life of its own.It creates anxiety.Pharaoh is anxious about the food monopoly (26).It is an ontology of violence (30-31).The Sabbath is a commitment to covenant (relationship) rather than commodity (bricks).  Most of the ten commandments have something to do with the horizontal Other, my neighbor.  The economics of Pharaoh does not allow for neighborliness.  The economics of the Sabbath demands it.Thesis:  Sabbath is a bodily act of testimony to alternative and resistance to pervading values and assumptions behind those values (21).Resistance to AnxietyAnxiety makes neighborliness impossible (26).  God counters anxiety with neighborliness.Resistance to CoercionThe prosperity of the land will eventually lead to two economic systems: possession or inheritance (38).The aim of market ideology is to make us forget our rootage and to let ourselves be defined by alien expectations (39). The Sabbath makes us remember that God broke the cycle of coercive production.Resistance to ExclusivismWhom does Brueggemann think are the Insiders?  Brueggemann suggests that Isaiah 56 reworks Dt 23 so that Sabbath is the criterion of membership (54).  A Sabbath person is defined by justice, mercy, and compassion, and not competition, achievement, and production.Sabbath and the Tenth CommandmentThe 10th commandment rejects an attitude of and a forced action to secure what is craved (71).  Given that the term neighbor occurs 3x in the commandment, it is also about preserving the neighborhood.Brueggemann speculates, albeit with some justification, that these were agrarian peasants and the commandment ultimately applied to protecting them against urban elites, which in todays terms meant:state powercorporate wealthlegal sharpnesscredentialed religionIn conclusion, the tenth commandment, and Sabbath-practice in general, is a safeguard for a certain way of organizing social power in the interest of the neighborhood (77).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGEOB8XAMK2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664239285#wasThisHelpful","RKGEOB8XAMK2M","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easily Lewis's best work. This should be on the front shelves at every Christian book store. Lewis frighteningly predicted the rise of the scientific, planning state.But unlike other books on the New World Order, Lewis advocates (or at least Dr Ransom does), fighting back. And not just fighting back with abstract ideas, but also with revolvers.Lots of memorable moments: Ransom explains manliness and marriage, beards, and many other things. Shows how the planning state creates disasters in order to bring in their pre-arranged solution.We read in That Hideous Strength that the first time Jane Studdock looks at Ransom her world is unmade.  Why?  Because up until that moment Jane believes in a world of total egalitarianism.  Now she realizes, once again, in the depths of her soul, that hierarchy holds a deeper truth than the legal fiction of equality.  Lewis writes,She had (or so she had believed)  disliked bearded faces except for old men with white hair.  But that was because she had long since forgotten the imagined Arthur of her childhoodfor the first time in many years the bright solar blend of king and lover and magician which hangs about that name (Lewis is here referring to King Solomon) stole back upon her mind.  For the first time in all those years she had tasted the word Kingitself with all linked associations of battle, marriage, priesthood, mercy, and power.  At that moment, as her eyes first rested upon his [Ransoms] face, Jane forgot who she was, and whereher world was unmade; she knew that.

"Wink seeks to recapture the integrity of speaking about spiritual powers in a materialistic world.  If that is all his thesis is, he is more or less successful, albeit with some major problems.  The reviewer faces a problem of a double-paradox.  In terms of the larger scope--that there are invisible forces that aid or harm us--Wink is successful.  In terms of narrower focus--exegesis of texts and historical reconstruction--Wink is interesting, if not always careful.  However, when you combine the two visions his project falls apart.If I can summarize his view of angels/demons it goes something like this:  they are personified moments of the Archetypes acting upon the human psyche.  This isnt necessarily wrong but it doesnt always square with Winks analysis in other places.  Some aspects of the Christian tradition did suspect that paganisms gods and Platos Forms were probably similar to what we would call angels and demons (and it is important to keep in mind that Plato thought the Forms had causal power).His chapters on angels engage in a unique interpretation of Revelation. Wink suggests that aggelos in Revelation 2-3 refers not to a specific bishop, nor to what we normally call angels, but that the church in its totality refers to an angelic manifestation.  There are some problems to this, but a case can be made for it.  The you in these chapters is always singular, not plural.  Further, if aggelos does refer to a messenger or bishop, then why does the term never refer to that afterwards?Wink suggests that angel and people are the inner and outer aspects of the same reality (72). Bizarrely enough, the angel is held accountable for the churchs action.  This allows Wink to acknowledge that each church has a spirit that manifests the collective subconscious of the church.  All psycho-jargon aside, there might be something to this.  Anyone who has dealt with church problems can usually sense the spirit of the church in the air.The angel can only be confronted by Christ via a human, prophetic intermediary.  God does this, rather than speaking directly to the corporate angels, because, as Wink suggests, heaven is the realm of transcendence latent within human possibility (81). Okay, thats just silly but he does capture an important truth:  heaven is not up there, but rather that which is beyond the veil.Criticisms and Problems~Wink acknowledges the reality of guest spirits via occult paraphernalia (58).  However, he defines demonic possession as an estrangement from ones self as imago Dei and full social being (59).  The problem with this definition is that it doesnt make sense of his previous acknowledged guest spirits.  Further, he admits that outer personal demons do possess knowledge beyond that of their hosts, albeit a meager knowledge.  Very true, but it doesnt fit with his definition of demonic activity.He speaks of this primordial power of evil (25) as opposed to a Satan-personality (not sure why they are mutually exclusive?) yet this raises the question:  from where (whom?) did this primordial power of evil originate? He wrestles with this very question (27ff), even coming across various insights and questions (e.g., does Satan gain access by our neuroses? Washington and Moscow are actually on the same side), yet dodges any real answer.~Is he saying that the fragmentary nature of evil (i.e., the Satan, if you will) is what prevents our realizing self-transcendence (30)?  What is this but Gnosticism?~He defends paganism (24, 36).  Seriously, I am not kidding.  Perhaps he is saying we shouldnt demonize (oops!) the Other.  Fair enough, but has he done research on Moloch worship?~He engages in emotional blackmail (182 n94).  He tells the story of a woman who grew up Roman Catholic, wanted to become a priest but denied access.  She got angry, became a prostitute, and joined the church of Satan (later she was redeemed).  A sad story, to be sure, but what conclusion does he want us to draw?~Wink engages in inflammatory rhetoric, as in Spanish thugs (74).  Mind you, I have no love for colonial Roman Catholicism, but this seems more like sneaking in a cheap shot.~He pushes his own agenda.  Either a church is self-engrossed or engaged in social justice (76), which usually means the Democratic National Convention.~Advocates a one-world government (102).  This follows upon a particularly astute discussion of nationalism and how nations are biblical.  Not sure how his two theses mesh.ConclusionHe regularly engages with fresh insights and interesting exegesis.  Unfortunately, it is marred by a polemical and deeply political tone reminiscent of his era.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM3O7986LE93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800619021#wasThisHelpful","R2HM3O7986LE93","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And here Bulgakov finishes his magisterial trilogy.  Building upon earlier Sophialogical foundations, he reworks Anthropology and Ecclesiology towards an Eschatological vision.  In this volume he further clarifies unclear points in *Lamb of God* and moves away from some Platonic and Gnostic suggestions he had earlier made.Bulgakov's project revolves around the distinction between Divine Sophia and Creaturely Sophia.  Divine Sophia is Divinity as such, Glory.  It is the Divine World.  However, this isn't Gnosticism, for Bulgakov does not see Divine Sophia as a hypostasis.Divine Sophia has a creaturely Sophianic mode of existence in which the world exists. It is here that Bulgakovs project shines in all its brilliance but also threatens to come undone.  He admits that the existence of the world-soul marks a loss of clarity and one wonders if he is reverting back to Aristotles chain of being.  But it is a lively chain, for he assures us: There is no place for dead matter in the world.We are speaking of the world soul, not the world spirit.  The difference between soul and spirit is that the soul is not hypostatic, whereas the Spirit is.  The soul corresponds to the spirits nature.  It is the spirits hypostatizedness. This is not Neo-Platonism, for he does not see the World Soul as a hypostasis.  The World-Soul is a connected, multi-organic unity. It is the worlds inner entelechy which unifies. Therefore, there is an inner life principle in the world.  If this were not so, then why would we enjoin creation to praise God if creation is merely dead matter? It is the actualization of creaturely being (197).  The world-soul actualizes creations instincts for power.In its proper being it is divided into heaven and earth Creaturely sophia experiences aeviternitas.  Divine Sophia aeternitas.Bulgakov has a beautiful section on Angels.  Angels are how God usually relates nature (199).  They are the bearers of the sophicanic prototypes of creation and the earths reality.  Creation arises through the elemental forces of the world soul but its formation presupposes angelic activity and participation (Rev. 7:1, 14:18; 16:5; and fight battles).Angels are the sophicanic heaven of the world, the creaturely bridge between Divine Sophia and Creaturely sophia, metaxu.  Angels contain the assurance that creation is a ladder of life.Main PointThe connection of God and the world is grounded in Sophianicity.  The divine Sophia is one, though she has two forms of being (223).  Bulgakov argues that the Western insistence on speaking of God as First Cause and creation as Second Cause has the effect of subsuming the latter under the former.  Rather, God is not the cause of the world but the Creator. In the creation of the world God repeats or doubles his own Being.  This is the Divine Sophia positing the Creaturely Sophias mode of existence (222). It is the self-repetition of the Divine Sophia.Eschatology and the Sophianic DescentGlory in the Trinity corresponds to the revelation of the third hypostasis in the dyad of the Fathers self-revelation.  The Holy Spirit as glory rests upon the Son.Kenosis: removal of glory from the world, not from the Trinity.  However, his earthly ministry includes a movement towards Glory (Tabor, the Cross).The dyad of Son-Spirit underwent a sort of kenosis as well.  The Spirit reduced the degree of glory in his repose on Christ.  The two kenoses are parallel, but they occasoinally coincide and diverge.In the Ascension the kenosis of the Son is overcome.  The descent of the Spirit is a kenotic act as such, for its action in the world remains limited by the measure of creaturely reception (398).The third hypostasis does not have a personal revelation as such.  It looks like it is submerged into Glory, but this is not the case.  Glory is not a property.  It is divinity as such. Divinity is the revelation of the father in the bihypostatic Dyad of the Son and the Holy Spirit (407). In relation to the Son, Divinity is Wisdom.In relation to the Holy Spirit, Divinity is Glory. Therefore, if Christ is the hypostatic Wisdom of God, then the Holy Spirit is hypostatic glory, albeit hidden since the Holy Spirit doesnt have a hypostatic manifestation.  Pentecost is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit in Tongues of Fire, which isnt hypostatic.The Transfiguration of the WorldThe world will be illumined with the lightning of the Parousia.The heavenly fire--the sophianic descent of the Holy Spirit--will set the world on fire and melt it.  That is the first action of the Holy Spirit in the world in its parousia (421).  How was the first Pentecost possible since the world cannot withstand such glory without being burned up?  First it was possible because of the Incarnation.Relation between matter and spirit: the world receives its materiality from the Holy Spirit, so spirit is the basis of matter.  Therefore, it is open to spirit.Conclusion:The book is sheer magnificence.  That is not to say Bulgakov's project is without problems.  There are a number of troubling angles, not least the which is an almost absence of exegesis.  Further, Bulgakov admits that many key points are absent in Scripture (pertaining to Mariology).

"I checked this book out from the library because 1) I am part Celt and thought it would be interesting and 2) I was interested in the argument made by others that the Celtic church had Eastern strands distinct from Latin Christianity and maybe this guy could elucidate. The book failed miserably on both points.Have you seen the movie ""Meet the Robinsons?"" In the movie the frog tells the bad guy, after one of his plans fails, ""I just don't think this plan was thought through."" That's how this book is. A relatively good idea, strung together by some gnostic texts and cliched feminist arguments, with a little Erigena and St Irenaeus thrown in for giggles.His initial argument isn't that off the mark, however. Quoting Erigena and St Irenaeus Newell says that Celtic Christianity sees the cosmos as a unified whole and points to Christ as the Eternal Memory and the one in whom all of reality is recapitulated. A bit Platonic, to be sure, but definitely orthodox and exciting. Had he stayed on this level he would be okay. Unfortunately, Newell kept writing.I don't think he understood the initial contradiction between quoting (to make the same argument) the gnostic Gospels of St Thomas and the savage anti-gnostic writings of St Irenaeus. But to be fair, Newell says he opposes gnosticism. I want to believe him but he uses every cliched gnostic and feminist argument in the book. He sets up the pure Celtic/feminine/anti-virgin Mary Church over against the evil Imperial church (think Republican Party) of Constantine. And those meany Constantinians are trying to take over the world and strip-mine matter, introduce original sin, and the like.  N.T. Wright has already refuted this nonsense and I won't waste time here.EVALUATIONIt's a shame, really. There really is much promise in studying Celtic Christianity.  For example, how did John Scotus Eriugena come by the knowledge of Maximus the Confessor?We need sane, serious people to write books on this topic. Legitimate Cetlic expressions such as Erigena and St Irenaeus, and perhaps a Celticized form of St Maximus the Confessor is a good argument against gnosticism and imperialism. Newell needs to read some basic intro texts on Church history.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N6AWYHRR8IPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470183500#wasThisHelpful","R2N6AWYHRR8IPP","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways this might be Wright's best work ever.  I had always suspected something like his thesis when I read the Psalms (more on that below) but I couldn't articulate it.  Wright says the Psalms transform the reader (better yet, the chanter and singer) because they place him or her at the intersection of Space, Time, and Matter--the very place where Jesus of Nazareth is.People who pray the psalms will be learning to live in Gods time, space, and matter (the stuff we are made of) as well as our own (Wright 27). The psalms resonate with Jesus because he was the one who stood at the intersection of Gods time/space/matter and ours (30).The threshold of God's Time:The ebb and flow in the Psalms teach us an eschatological balance.  The theme of time helps us with those instances where we are called to sing of the enthronement of Yahwehs king (44). And we shouldnt shrink back from the royalist overtones in our democratic age, for we are called to be his vice-regents.More specifically, Yahweh also called Israel to care for the world (Genesis 12:3). But given Israels failure, God narrows his focus to the House of David. Therefore, the intersection of Gods time with our time--and always with the Davidic King in the foreground--comes into focus in Psalm 89.Where God DwellsThe Temple is where Gods space and our space intersect.  If the worlds Creator lives in Jerusalem, then it stands to reason (Ps. 2) that he will rule from Jerusalem.The temple turns out to be an advance foretaste of Yahwehs claim on the whole of creation...It is a sign that the creator God is desiring...to recreate the world from within (91).1. The temple is a heaven-and-earth reality, a microcosm of creation.2. Psalm 24: Yahweh takes up residence in his temple.3. Temple and Torah are connected and both point ahead to Gods new place.4. Temple Psalms and Pneumatology: the new Temple is indwelt by the Spirit.5. Covenant renewal generates fresh idea of sacred space.All the trees of the forest sing for joyWestern modernity sees matter as lifeless matter. The Psalms, however, see creation throbbing with the potential glory of God.  Gods glory either already fills the whole earth or it will fill the earth (124).This ties in with Covenant and Kingship:  the true King will bring justice and peace to the earth, which will renew creation (Psalm 72).Wisdom and CreationPsalm 104:19-24 combines themes from Genesis 1 and Proverbs 8.  Paul picks up this Wisdom-Creation tradition and places it in Jesus (Colossians 1:15-20, 2.2-3).Summary of ThemeTime: the past of creation, the future of Judgment, and the present of celebration are drawn together.Space: what was promised for the Temple is now promised for the whole world.Matter: we are standing at the fault line of the original material of creation and the glory-filled material of the new creation (144).Conclusion and Nota Bene:The book is simply magnificent. I honestly cant think of a single flaw.Nota BeneWright says at one time in his life when he was witnessing to Gaia-worshiping pantheists, he felt an oppressive darkness and Yahweh gave him deliverance by bringing Psalm 97 (which happened to be the next Psalm in the prayerbook reading) to mind, Yahweh is King.

"Even discounting Marx's own views, this was surprisingly good.  It reads like a Victorian economic thriller. Indeed, Wheen suggests that Das Kapital is economics disguised as Victorian Gothic horror.  Wheen gives a brief account of Marx's (self-inflicted) tragic life, then shows how Das Kapital came to fruition and the aftershocks.There is a brief overview of Marx's economic thought, which need not be belabored here. Now back to the Victorian horror.  For Marx, capitalist tradition is a world of spectres and apparitions (Wheen 39). This explains why some critics couldn't understand Kapital.  It isn't so much incoherent, but rather echoes the instability of capitalism itself.  Or so Wheen says.  I reserve judgment at the moment.Criticisms:Wheen really doesn't deal with the main problem of Marx's thought.  The main rebuttal to Marx: the exchange value of pearls and diamonds derives solely from the labour-time spent on retrieving and transforming them, which presumably isnt that much, why do people pay thousands of dollars for them?Marx tries to respond to this by saying commodity fetishim represents the rule of the object over the human, of dead labor over living.  In other words, this is so because we are still under the objects rule.  This might be so and in fact (and probably unbeknownst to Marx himself), echoes St Paul's warnings to the Galatians and Colossians not to live under the stoichea.What did Marx mean by saying that capitalism leads to the proletariats impoverishment?  He says that capital knows how to transfer its expenses from its own shoulders to those of the proletariat.  Further, and this is key, labour always lags behind capital.  Even more, Marx, like Christ, not defining poverty simply in terms of material wealth, but in crushing the human spirit. Capital does not aim at a reduction of the working day but a minimizing of the labour-time necessary for producing a commodity. This doesnt seem true.  The working day today, as opposed to Victorian England, is shorterPost-Marxist DevelopmentsThe Frankfurt school gave rise to Critical Theory, which rejected the economic determinism of Lenin.  Also questioned traditional Marxist attitudes towards proletariat class consciousness.  Indeed, for Marcuse economics almost falls out the picture.  This explains why today's neo-conservatives, while ostensibly anti-Marxist, are in fact Frankfurtian Marxists.  Marcuse doesn't demand economic determinism, so one can hold to a market economy while holding to Marxist analyses of society.  Like the Republican and Democratic Parties.Criticisms of Marxs AnalysisMarx subsumes a lot under the term capitalism.  Is he talking about Free Enterprise, Gangster Libertarianism, or Mercantilism?  Its not always clear.  When he makes excellent points against Mercantilism (Wheen 60), he is calling it capitalism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7RWKICIIX2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802143946#wasThisHelpful","R2F7RWKICIIX2A","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grace all the way downSmith avoids the stereotypes of Reformed theology by beginning with creation.  Creation is radically dependent on Gods existence (Col. 1:16-17) and all of our existence is a gift (donum, 1 Cor. 4:7).  Seeing our whole existence as radically dependent on God, it is something we cant boast about.  Smith has come very close to cutting off synergism at the pass. Im impressed (Smith 14ff).However, Smith skirts dangerously close to saying creation--and hence nature--is grace.  Is he saying nature = grace? Not necessarily, but he comes very close.Confession(alism)*The Confessions are the grammar of the Church.  They are not meant to be the language.HooraySmith, like the Dutch Reformed in general, is strong on creation.  He notes that Gods creation is laden with plurals (66). This is death to chain of being ontologies which sees plurality and multiplicity as a metaphysical fall from oneness.*Smith comes down hard on the New Calvinists (They seem so grumpy! p.90).*Smith correctly refuses (and even ridicules) the idea that Reformed = Calvinism = TULIP.  IYikesHe loves the Heidelberg Catechism (which is good) but compares it to the arid scholasticism of Westminster (55).  On one hand, different strokes for different folks, but Smith earlier complained about how Dutch/German and Scottish Calvinism never seem to get along. Its not hard to see why.He says the main difference between Westminster and the Heidelberg is that the latters inclusion of the Apostles Creed means that it receives tradition as a gift.  I have no problem with receiving tradition as a gift, and indeed it cuts hard against Anchorite claims, but it seems a rather simplistic analysis.ConclusionI would give this to a yungun in Reformed theology or someone interested in it.

"We all know that worldviews (hereafter w-v) are inescapable. Worldviews rarely move beyond the intellectual dimension.  Smith doesnt want to do away with w-v talk, but to place it within a larger whole.  We are not simply isolated intellects, but situated intellects--situated and embodied.  We are always embodied individuals and we experience the world as being-in-the-world (per Heidegger).And we are not Gnostics.  Rather, The Spirit marshals our embodiment in order to rehabituate us into the kingdom of God (15).What is imagination?  Smith defines imagination as  a kind of faculty by which we navigate and make sense of our world, but in ways and on a register that flies below the radar of conscious reflection (19).  This is why using concepts like social imaginary or plausibility structure is much superior to w-v.  W-v rightly highlights the inescapability of presuppositions on our thinking.  We do not deny that.  Smith notes, however, that social structures and our bodily being-in-the-world also function in a pre-theoretical (per Dooyeweerd) manner.Knowing in the Body and By StoriesLiturgies are not only aesthetic, but kineasethic.  They come to us in the body and tell a story.Perceiving by Stories*Who we are is shaped by the stories we encounter and imbibe.  We live into the stories weve absorbed; weve become characters in the drama that has captivated us (32).*narrative trains our emotions and those emotions condition our perception of the world.*we are not disembodied choice machines.Smith aims to capture the creational conditions of human action (33).Perception and evaluation are intricately linked.*Affect and emotion are part of the background I bring with me that constitutes the situation as a certain kind of situation (35).*Stories are means of emotional prefocusing that shape our tacit take on the world (38).*Antepredicative know--the affective register upon which narrative operates--is processed by the body below the cognitive level (Merleau-Ponty).Pre-cognitive perception breaks down the traditional epistemology of subjects and objects.  ""The world is not what I think, but what I live through (Merleau-Ponty).  Our being-in-the-world is between instinct and intellect (43).  We arent just thinking-things.  We dont have being-in-the-world; we are being-in-the-world (44).More on StoriesA story has a flow and rhythm that simply isnt reducible to a string of facts.  A string of facts is not a story.  Its a memo.  No one dies for a memo.  No ones embodied life is transformed by a data brief.  But people do die for the Story of Matthew, for instance.The material meaning of a poem means uniquely because it is meant on the register of motor intentionality (Merleau-Ponty).  Kineaesthetic and Poetics are interconnected.Worship: Story as LiturgySmith doesnt add too much on Reformed liturgies.  He does apply his earlier insights into how it shapes stories, drawing on scholarship on John Calvin.  We can rejoice that more Evangelicals are moving away from 3 songs and a lecture, 3 points and a poem.  People dont die for that, either.  So, good stuff here.We live at the nexus of story and body--a between space where the aesthetic power of a story captures our imagination because it resonates with our body. And all good liturgies tell an implicit story.  The Holy spirit reconfigures our neural maps.Liturgy is a shorthand term for those rituals that are loaded with a Story about who and what we are (139).  It is an imaginative social practice that captures our imaginations by becoming the stories we tell ourselves in order to live.Criticisms:Smith admits he has a hard task: steer a middle course between popular literature and the scholar.  He kind of succeeds.  His thesis is fascinating and I believe (literally) life-transforming.  Still, one gets the feeling he is often Dancing on the edge rather than diving in for the kill shot. As a result, a lot of sections seemed to go on in a way that repeated earlier chapters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YXLQOKSRSO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801035783#wasThisHelpful","R11YXLQOKSRSO6","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Taylor claims this isn't merely a summation of his earlier tome on Hegel. That's not really true. A number of pages are lifted but I think he succeeds in succinctly tying Hegel's ontology to Hegel's politics and showing the latter's relevance for the modern age.Hegel's OntologyHegel sought to synthesize the Romantic desire for freedom and expression with the Rationalist desire for Reason. The Romantics saw Enlightenment science severing mans unity. Man can only be self-conscious when he abstracts himself from the world. But when he does that, he severs himself from the organic unity of life. Reason and Life are thus opposites. But they are opposites which cant exist without the other.This leads us to Geist (God, sort of) as the Embodied Subject. A rational subject must be embodied because their must be an opposite pole in which it may flourish. Hegel rejects both Christian theism (God independent of the world) and naturalism (God as not absolute). Self-positing: God eternally creates the conditions of his existence. Hegel is not so much arguing for an existent reality, but for the conditions that Geist be.What is the Dialectic?we start with the most elementary notion of what consciousness is, to show that this cannot stand up, that it is riven with inner contradiction and must give way to a higher one, which is also in turn shown to be contradictory (55).Politics as Alienation OvercomeModern society has seen the proliferation of Romantic views of life along with the rationalization and bureaucratization of collective structures and an exploitive stance toward nature (71). The adequate form of Spirit (remember, Spirit must be embodied) is social. Man has to be part of something larger than himself, since man cannot exist by himself.alienation: this happens whenever the public existence no longer has meaning for me: e.g., the perceived futility of voting; nominal religious belief in Church-States. Individuals then strike out on their own to define their individuality. They then (ironically) come together as a new social unit.Negative freedom would require that the whole outcome be decided by me. Yet, the whole outcome is a social one, so it cannot be decided by me alone. Thus, negative freedom is impossible.The Modern DilemmaHere is why modern liberal society is doomed: radical participation in civic structures is only possible if there is a ground of agreement, or underlying common purpose (Augustines common objects of love).Democracy and participation cannot create this; they merely presuppose it. The demand for absolute freedom by itself is empty.Modern ideology and equality leads to homogenization [Taylor isn't always clear on what he means by homogenization] of society. It is an acid drip on traditional structures, yet it cannot replace them.Hegel and MarxThis is where Charles Taylor, using Hegel's analysis, cuts Marxism to the bone. The Soviet view sees the proletarian party as engineers of building in conformity with the laws of history[combining] two opposed pictures of the human predicament. It shows us man, on one hand, imposing his will on the course of history...On the other hand dialectical materialism sets out the laws which govern man and history with an iron necessity (151). The laws of history cannot be the basis of social engineering and reveal the inevitable trend of events (152).Analysis and ConclusionA Christian cannot accept Hegel's ontology. It echoes pantheism and is openly process theology. Hegel's analysis of epistemology on lower levels is sometimes interesting. Hegel's insights on politics (if not his conclusions!) are occasionally brilliant.The concepts of social alienation are more pronounced today than ever before. Hegel was spot on. His critique of Negative Freedom of the French Revolution applies equally to Marxism (and its body count) and the Cultural Leninism of today's America.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS27XOQ5ITAL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521293510#wasThisHelpful","RS27XOQ5ITAL4","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kevin Vanhoozer focuses on the metaphysical implications of meaning.  His work surveys the collapse of foundationalisms, their postmodern alternatives, and his own speech-act hermeneutics that paves the way forward from the postmodern morass, albeit sympathetic to some of Jacques Derridas criticisms.Risking some oversimplification, Vanhoozer sees the three eras as the Age of the Author (we can know the authors meaning in a text), the Age of the Text (e.g., late Modernity; we cant know the authors psychological intentions, but we can find meaning by focusing on the structure of the text), and the Age of the Reader (there is no transcendent meaning in the text; we create meaning).Vanhoozer characterizes postmoderns as either Undoers (Derrida, deconstruction) or Users (Rorty, pragmatism).  Vanhoozer goes to great pains to understand postmodernism, even if he doesnt affirm it.  Derrida is correct there is no pure realm of meaning and presence of which we have hermetic access.  All such knowings and readings are situated knowings and readings.  But that doesnt mean we cant know.  Derrida himself admits he is not a relativist.  He simply says if all meanings are situated meanings and that there is no Transcendental Signifier, what privileges one reading over another?Vanhoozers answer is along the lines of the Trinity.  God is first and foremost a communicative agent. Being and Speech is not reduced to a monad.  It is indeed deferred.  There is differance (though not ontological difference) but not violence in the Trinity.  His very being is a self-communicative act.  Trinitarian hermeneutics affirms both the One and the Many.  There is meaning and unity in the text, but arrived by a plurality of literary methods.With Paul Ricouer Vanhoozer agrees that metaphor is not simply literary window-dressing.  It has ontological significance.  The goal of Matthew is not to get to Romans.  Metaphors can actually break deconstruction: they are determinate enough to convey stable meaning without being exhaustively specifiable (130).  With Derrida we agree that all language is ultimately metaphorical (and thus problematic for metaphysics). But with Ricoeur and against Derrida, we believe that metaphors are meaningful and do communicate truth, even if they dont exhaust the truth.ProsThis book is magnificent.  I sing its praises.  Aside from the brilliant crash course in continental philosophy, Vanhoozer introduces readers to speech-act philosophy. He has a sensitive reading of sola scriptura which nicely rebuts communitarian claims.ConsMany of the chapters were excessively long (several were 300+ endnotes).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21DNIXH5L6SVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310324696#wasThisHelpful","R21DNIXH5L6SVT","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thesis: Westphal, following James K. A. Smith's The Fall of Interpretation, argues that we should not seek a ""pure stream"" reading of the Bible that bypasses the act of interpretation. This position of seeking and *im*mediate reading of the text has precendents in Plato0 when he said the philosopher apprehends the purely intelligible structures (Phaedo 66e) In other words, our reading of the Bible is mediated to us by our hermeneutical filters, be they cultural, linguistic, philosophical, or whatever.Westphal then examines recent moves in philosophical hermeneutics from the Romantics to Schlieirmacher to Wolterstorff.But What About the Radical French Postmodernists? The alleged problem comes with the French trio (Derrida, Foucault, and someone else) who assert, so it is said, ""The death of the author.""But maybe they aren't saying exactly that (mind you, I have my own questions about Derrida).Even the French trio doesnt think the author is truly dead. To deny that the author is the unilateral source of a texts meaning is not to deny that the author plays an important role (58). Westphal explains, For our French trio, the finitude of the author in relation to the text is expressed in a double relativity. In the first place, human authors create meaning only relative to the language available to them...this language shapes and conditions their thought in ways of which they are unaware and over which they do not preside (59).To say it yet another way: The author is not a godlike, infinite creator of meaning (65). Humans are finite and our sub-creations (what Milbank would call mythopoesis) are always within the realm of the finite and conditioned.Westphal then comes to the heart of his project: Hans Georg Gadamer. We must affirm tradition, but in line with our anthropology, we must affirm the ""finitude"" of our tradition.Gadamer's fundamental thesis about tradition is belonging. p. 70. Tradition plays a double-role. It gives us a place to stand and it is is plural. We do not belong to a single, universal tradition. All interpretation is relative to traditions that have formed the perspectives and presuppositions that guide it (71).To be historically means that knowledge of oneself can never be complete (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 301-302).Westphal then offers several theses on reading tradition and being read by tradition:Alterity Thesis. Tradition as other. Tradition will set before us what it has already done within us.Authority Thesis. We acknowledge tradition as a sub-authority over us. My conscience is a grounded opacity that allows a richly mediated knowledge of its object (Westphal 74).Fallibility Thesis. Question of critique: How can we distinguish the true prejudices--by which we understand--from the false prejudices (by which we misunderstand (75). Tradition must be open to this critique. Even worse, the difference between true and false is not always either/or but a matter of degree.What the French Should have saidAuthorial intent is important in understanding a text, but only to a degree. Authors themselves are wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstein, historically effected consciousness. They dont have absolute self-transperancy either. Westphal has an interesting suggestion: there is a power at work in finite authorial creation--for Gadamer, tradition--of whose agency and effects the author is never fully aware (81).Conclusion and EvaluationIn terms of philosophical analysis the work is first-rate. Westphal may be the only Continental-school philosophy who can write clearly. Unfortunately, Westphal moves to analysis--and since that deals with the church, theology. Here the book suffers from ambiguityWestphal suggests we should follow Gadamer in seeing Truth Beyond [Scientific] Method. I have no problem with that, but aside from references to beautiful art and literature, I am not exactly sure what he wants me to do.Westphal offers an interesting paradigm for understand difference in the church. He highlights the debate between political liberalism (classical liberalism in society) and communitarianism (Alasdair MacIntyre). Political liberalism affirms difference but in the midst of an overlapping sphere of agreement among the parties involved. Of course, this is valuable for the church: we will disagree at times, and even traditions (Rome, EO) that pretend to be uniform have to own up to that. Ironically, though, it is rather strange to find a postmodern writer affirming classical liberalism, which is a child of the Enlightenment.Westphal realizes that and admits the communitarian model is probably better for the church (but he rejects it for the state).The book ends with a hopeful suggestion taken from the Roman-Lutheran Joint Declaration on Justification. The theology behind such a move is atrocious and one is disappointed that Westphal ended a fine book on so weak a note.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EAA9SP6U45JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801031478#wasThisHelpful","R3EAA9SP6U45JW","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jamie Smith succeeds in what he sets out to do:  make Derrida accessible.  I've been a critically sympathetic reader of Smith for almost a decade, so some of this was familiar territory.  He clears away a lot of misconceptions about Derrida:*Deconstruction is not a method (9ff).  Each deconstructive event remains singular.  It is not something we do.  It happens in the middle voice.  Ca se deconstruit.  It happens within texts because of the texts.*Smith suggests alterity is the lens through which we interpret Derrida (13).  Deconstructionism is a response to the other.  Sees reference as languages relation to the other of language (14).  Derrida suggests a fundamental link between alterity and Judaism (15).Smith takes us on a journey from Plato to Judaism to Something New Today.  Continuing our theme of ""alterity,"" we see Word-Things as Phenomenology's Other.** In the Beginning was the Word**The world of signs--whether graphemes and phonemes--is a world of sensuous phenomena that activate and depend on the body (17). The West treated language as a means to larger metaphysical questions.  Language was always considered mundane.  And so enters Husserl. Our Western preconceptions thought that Language was governed by temporality. It was Always associated with passing away.  Therefore, philosophy sought to ground knowledge in something more stable than language--ideas.Husserl then Advances Platos thought that ideas have a history.  Knowledge grows into a projected horizon.  Suggests that ideas receive objectivity through language.  Derridas contention has been that language in general is affected by mediation.  What the logocentric condition took to be a contamination is its original condition (43).  What was thought to be confined to writing is in fact true of all language: mediation, signifiers, culture.Arche-Writing is a synonym for differanceJD explains differance in terms of alterity.  The primacy of mediation and spacing is to make room for what Derrida calls il ny a pas de hors-texte.  There is no aspect of our experience that escapes the play of signifiers.  The subject is a function of language.  He is a speaking-subject.  The subjects self-consciousness is constituted by a relation to an outside, to a community of others which grants language.

"He divides his work into metaphysics and theology.  Initially, this is a valid move (especially if you think substance metaphysics is necessary to Trinitarian and gospel proclamation).  From there, things get complicated.Swinburne repeats a lot of material from Evolution of the Soul.  He makes a number of good points on necessity and type-token identity.With regards to theology, Swinburne begins on a promising note and defines the concept of God along these lines (which I shall denote with a number):(1)  there exists necessarily and eternally a person (?) essentially bodiless, omnipresent, creator and sustainer of any universe there may be, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and a source of moral obligation (125).Well and good.  Gods foreknowledge(2) God knows at each period of time all those propositions which it is logically possible that he entertain then and which if entertained by him then are true (131).This raises problems, so Swinburne thinks, with Gods foreknowledge of future, free human actions.  So:(2) God has knowledge of all propositions which it is possible that he entertain at that time.Which seems to be:(2*) Gods free knowledge is limited by other agents free choices (133)This is a highly unsatisfying conclusion. We shall offer a more substantial critique later.Swinburne rejects the Boethian view of God and Time (though he erroneously ascribes that view to the Bible, 139). That view goes as follows:(3) Gods simultaneous existing at any single moment, where moment is defined as instant.However, earlier considerations (chapter 4) defined state of affairs as lasting for a period of time.  So Swinburne reads the dilemmas God is either sovereign for an instant, which means he is not sovereign over a state of affairs. He clarifies the criticism:(3) If God brings about states of affairs, not only just merely knowing them, then his actions must precede the events themselves.The Divine NatureRS defines the divine nature as pure, unlimited bodily power able to act in all places without intermediary.  Gods simple essence, therefore, is monadanic.  It belongs to him in virtue of who he is, not in relation to some(thing)one else.The TrinityConvoluted section of limited value.  Some good remarks on Richard of St. Victor.  Perfect love involves there being someone else to whom to be generous, and also perfect loving involves a third individual, the loving of whom could be shared with a second.  The Father needs a socium et condilectum (an ally and fellow-loved) in his loving.Great discussion on the communicatio idiomata.  He openly sides with Calvin. They rob Christ of his humanity. Total interpenetration rules out the divided mind view which alone does justice to the New Testament (211).Of course Swinburne is correct, but instead of saying divided mind, lets stick with the classical model of Christ having two minds (because of two natures).  The concept of the divided mind, if not taken literally, comes into play in how the two minds interact.CriticismsIn rejecting Platonism Swinburne thinks he is holding to a modified nominalism.  That may be so, but he construes realism (or Platonism) as holding that abstract properties are substances, which, on his take, is absurd.  He reasons that properties like wisdom have to be instantiated and not free-floating.If wisdom is to be a substance, then yes, it has to be instantiated.  But if wisdom is a universal or an essence, then it doesnt. Swinburne also thinks that Platonism (or realism) posits the forms as independent of God (which seems an odd criticism on Swinburne's part, since he believes that the ""Good"" exists apart from God's command and nature). Further, if, following Maximus the Confessor, the forms collectively are the [I]Logoi[/I], and the [I]Logoi[/I] is the refracted Logos, who is Christ, then we can posit the reality of the Forms yet maintain they are not apart from God.  Whether this is true or not isn't the point.  It is logically coherent and serves as a rebuttal to Swinburne's nominalism.Regarding Gods foreknowledge, Swinburnes position in (2*) assumes that if the future is certain (and presumably, if Gods knowing it makes it certain), then it makes no sense to speak of agents having free choices.  But even Arminians like William Lane Craig know this is a category fallacy.  Certainty is a predicate of persons, of knowers.  Necessity is a predicate of events known (Craig, The Middle Knowledge View, in Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views, 127-128).  Bruce McCormack clarifies: Gods foreknowledge gives him certainty with regard to what will happen.  Whether the events God knows with certainty take place necessarily or contigently is a function of the natural and historical conditions under which they take place (McCormack, The Actuality of God, in Engaging the Doctrine of God, 205).Those are the main criticisms of Swinburnes work. Other criticisms are minor, if more immediate.  The opening section is heavy on metaphysics, which is good, but it isnt always clear how the discussion will be relevant to his later treatment on the doctrine of God.EvaluationI would not make this my foundational book on the doctrine of God.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIKJ0PUR4FDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198235127#wasThisHelpful","R3VIKJ0PUR4FDH","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bavinck argues that a monistic account of the world cannot ground unity or diversity.  By contrast, the Christian revelation can account for a unity and a diversity that is not located within the phenomenal realm.  Bavinck traces the idea of revelation in its form and content and how it correlates with the rest of life (Bavinck 18). Accordingly, and perhaps truistically, philosophy of revelation takes its starting point from its object:  revelation.Bavinck then gives a tour-de-force of modern philosophy.  While he firmly rejects these philosophies, he doesn't give hysterical reductions of everything to Pantheism, Hegelianism, Darwinism, Insert-Bad-Guy-ism.  He sees clear advances they make against other secular alternatives.idealism:  correct in that reality is mediated by consciousness.  False when it infers from that the object of perception is within the mind itself (36).  Idealism confounds act with content.self-consciousness: the unity of real and ideal being. We know it immediately.  Here Bavinck anticipates later Reformed Epistemology: self-consciousness is a properly basic belief.  We do not know it by reasoning from prior beliefs.Christian revelation imparts a new kind of certainty (40).  This certainty is a confidence in Gods promises.Augustines claim on knowing God and the self:a. Augustine descended beyond thought alone: life precedes thought; faith, knowledgeb. the essence of the soul is not simply thought alone. He found ideas, norms, laws of certainty, truth.c. Memoria, intellectus, voluntas.Echoing later neo-Calvinist themes, Bavinck sees that each branch of knowledge (science, theology) has a barrier around it, not a boundary. Each branch must respect its own object of knowledge and character.  Kant unwittingly showed that when science tries to peer into the essence of things, it creates antinomies (57).The only way unity can preserve true differentiation is when it includes and enfolds the entire world seen as the product of divine wisdom (57-58).Evaluation:Bavinck, like Van Til after him, was incapable of giving a precision strike against a target.  Sometimes the chapters seemed to go on and on.  On the other hand, Bavinck, like Van Til, was able to carpet bomb and thoroughly cover an entire area.Some pages were simply beautiful.  Bavinck has a magnificently stirring section contrasting the Bible with Babylonian magick (112ff).  He writes, ""The Bible did not come from Babylon, but in its fundamental thought is in diametrical opposition to Babylon, and made an end to Babylon's spiritual dominion over the peoples."" That last clause is crucial: Babylon was never merely a political oppressor, but brought to bear her demonic, albeit immaterial personalities to its politics.While brief, this book is not particularly easy reading.  Bavinck assumes that you are relatively familiar with continental philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Further, most of his footnotes are in German, Dutch, or Latin.  Finally, my edition (AlevBooks) has larger pages and more words on a page than you would normally expect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HM1QHVTPSWC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098812520X#wasThisHelpful","R1HM1QHVTPSWC2","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Swinburne's thesis is that the human person cannot be reduced to brain-states, and that this non-reducible entity is what we call ""the soul.""  The first part of the book analyses how perceptions, beliefs, thoughts, and desires are {probably} not reducible to mere brain-events.Structure of the SoulIf we say the person can continue if the body is destroyed, we mean it is logically possible (146).basic argument: knowledge of what happens to bodies and their parts will not necessarily give you knowledge of the persons within them (147).  Cf., B. Williams, Mad Surgeon Story.  Further, a mans mental properties are not necessarily the same as his physical properties (155).  At least, we have no reason for thinking so and those who hold to materialism have far more to prove.Origin and Life of the Soulproblem: can the soul function when it is not having conscious episodes (sleep, etc)? Swinburne makes the distinction that the soul cannot function without a properly functioning brain, but it can exist without the brain (176).I am not so sure Swinburnes evolutionary narrative accounts for morality. He asserts with Darwin that those who evolved have well-marked social instincts which would eventually acquire morality (224).  The only evidence he offers is that animals demonstrate altruism towards their kin (except for those animals who eat their young and eat their mates, no doubt).  The universality of morality, therefore, can be attributed to some core principles (226).I am not persuaded and neither was T. H. Huxley.  Swinburne admits with Huxley that the practice of what is ethically best...is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic system (quoted in Swinburne, 227).His argument for free will is along the lines that Quantum Mechanics has ruled out a universal physical determinism, which would be our wills arent determined by our brain-states.  So far, so good.  The rest of the chapter consisted of mathematical formulas before which even the mightiest reader would quail.The Structure of the SoulAgents have belief-desire sets.  Per Quine, our beliefs form a net which impinges on experience only at its edges (see Quine, From a Logical Point of View, 42-46).  Our beliefs have to mesh with other beliefs (though there can be inconsistencies that arent obvious).  Swinburne takes Quines correct thesis and adds to it: desires interact with our belief network (Swinburne 263-264).Desires require beliefs.  If a man desire heroin and knows the effects of heroin, and you inject him with heroin, then as the effects wear off he will desire more heroin.  If you inject a sleeping man with heroin, as the effects wear off he will feel uneasy but wont desire heroin (not knowing what to desire). There are three ways to change desires: bodily change, a belief change, and a change of other desires (270-271).  Swinburne gives an extended and fascinating account of how our beliefs and desires function.  The upshot of this is our beliefs cant always be changed by neural procedures.  If one did succeed in switching beliefs, my other beliefs in the web, themselves not changed, would conspire to restore that former belief which gave unity (281).  Granted, this isnt a powerful stand-alone argument for the existence of the soul, but it is a difficulty for materialist views.The Future of the SoulSwinburne discusses various ""dis-embodied"" scenarios and rejects most of them.  He holds that Near-Death Experiences do not obtain because in all of these accounts it has not shown that the brain ceased to function.  I disagree.His conclusion: the soul cannot survive the body simply on its own powers.  I suppose thats true, but Swinburne comes dangerously close to (if not actually affirming) soul sleep. He likens the soul to a light bulb and the brain to the socket.  The light bulb still exists if the power is off, but it does not function.Pros:*Excellent discussion of belief-formation and how we change our desires.*Magnificent command of the secondary literature.  I didn't know what John Searle (Intentionality) and Saul Kripke (Naming and Necessity) were talking about until Swinburne explained them.*The appendices were wonderful.  Great discussion on Jaegwon Kim and supervenience.  Lots of tantalizing suggestions for future constructions.Criticism:Swinburne holds to neo-Darwinian evolution.  He claims, or appears to, that the soul evolved *separately* from the brain/body.  Perhaps, but few people, whether non-Christian or Christian, will buy that.  Further, given Swinburne's above agreement with Huxley, it's not clear how evolution works with the idea of a moral soul.I reject Swinburne's rejection of near-death experiences for the same reason I reject his ""soul-sleep.""  However, those objections turn on biblical data, which isn't relevant to his thesis (so no point listing them here).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNE6KGXSH3O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198236980#wasThisHelpful","RFNE6KGXSH3O1","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as spiritual disciplines books go, this is one of the better ones.  Foster is (usually) wise enough to know that enforcing a lot of these disciplines and practices as a ""law"" is legalism.  And he doesn't do that.  His thesis is simple (no pun intended):  simplicity allows us to live in freedom to God (Foster 3).  Simplicity exposes our numerous ""false selves.""How then should one live in simplicity?  Here is where it gets tricky. Foster knows he cannot ""make"" any of his suggestions a law for the Christian life, otherwise he is going beyond the gospel.  (Some of the earlier SoJo guys did just that, but to their credit they later retracted their Galatianism).  But he does give practical suggestions and many of them are quite good.Pros:1.  Great section on prayer and fasting.2.  Great section on the False Self (80-81).3.  He is aware that a lot of, say, Ron Sider's earlier proposals probably won't pan out and so he recommends a more balanced approach.cCons:1. Like many connected with Sojourner's Magazine, he accidentally makes the mistake of using big corporate government to fight big corporate government (181).  He advocates multinational institutions to fight multinational institutions.2. He praises the IMF as a possible rescue organization for the poor.  This is ironic since many social justice people criticize the IMF's loan policy as crippling the developing world.  So which is it?3.  There are problems with Adam Smith (174), but no one accused Marx and Engels of lifting 2 billion of the world's population out of poverty.4. He makes the astute observation that spiritual principalities are behind many unjust social structures (164-165).  Further, he is correct that these principalities can empower evil multinational corporations.  The problem is he paints himself into a corner:  he really has no way of fighting these multinational principality structures outside of appealing to something like the UN.  This cure is worse than the disease.  Further, he says exousiai in Romans 13 means spiritual principalities.  That reading really strains the rest of the text, those his larger point holds.Conclusion:I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  He is much more balanced than Sider et al.

"Smith begins his section on aesthetics with a good discussion of Platonisms rejection of art as a category of knowledge.  Thats fine but then he projects that understanding forward to modern day Reformed, and then ties in the Reformed with 8th century iconoclasts.  While some Reformed are gnostic platonists, the main reformed objection is not that beauty is bad and the divine cant be imaged, but what has God said for his worship?  Smith writes, appeal is often made to the liturgy...where all of the senses are engaged in order to communicate the truth of grace (1).  Maybe so, but that is no safeguard.  Any Baalist in ancient Israel could have made the same argument.  We arent worshipping the image, you silly Jew; we are worshipping God through the Golden Calf.Good section on apologetics.  what is considered as rational is always conditioned by pre-rational beliefs and assumptions (7).  Is this similar to Dooyeweerds pre-theoretical thought?  They note elsewhere that what goes under the name reason depends on religious commitments (28).Dualism/Monism:  dualism is two kinds of things existing in the world.  Monism one.Epistemology:  the standard question was phrased around justified true belief: a person p knows x if and only if p believes x and p belief in x is justified and p is true.  Plantinga has replaced and bettered this model with a belief is warranted if it is produced by our cognitive faculties working in accord with their design (20).essence/essentialism: belief that objects have essences and that is their identity.  An objects essence is a collection of all the universal properties it possesses (20).Free-will:  usually defined as the ability to do otherwise (30).  Hard determinism holds that all of our actions are determined by genetics or sociality or the decrees of God.  Soft Determinism holds all actions are determined but some of them are at least free.  Augustine distinguished between freedom of choice and free will.  A sinner can choose a number of things but because of the corruption of the will he cannot will the highest good (31).God, His Nature.  Classical theism holds that God has the standard attributes found in systematics discussions (communicable and incommunicable).  The incommunicable attributes are what is necessary for a most perfect being to exist.  While there are tensions in how the classical model is often portrayed, one of its strengths, as critics of open theism point out, is if we deny the standard incommunicable attributes of God, precisely what is there unique about the divine nature that is left?Heidegger, Martin.  Human beings are the kind of beings who reflect on what it is to be. MH avoided calling the human being a subject and rather called it da-sein.Hermeneutics.  Fairly standard entry, but points out how recent developments have altered the discussion. Now the interpretation is being-in-the-world.  Everything has a context.Human nature.  What makes us human? The options are usually functionalistic (define by what people do) or some form of essentialism. Both accounts are inadequate, as any good text on the imago dei will make clear.  Recent discussions suggest that Gods Triune relationality is an analogy.  Humans are not seen as static individuals but humans-in-a-relationship.  This isnt perfect, but it is a good way forward.Hume and causality.  Standard treatment of Hume.  Good discussion on causality.  We can only know when x occurs y occurs, but we cannot observe xs causing y.Idealism.  Berkeley argued that our only evidence of the world is perception, but perceptions are mental, not physical. Thus, only the reality of ideas.Leibniz. Fine discussion.  Each substance is isolated and pre-loaded by the Creator for self-sufficiency (thats how he explains the problem of causality--when two substances bump into each other, the pre-loaded causal forces are actually doing the moving and not the other substance).  Raised the charge of determinism and the rejoinder of best possible worlds.  Principle of Sufficient reason:  claim that every claim must have some sufficient reason why it, rather than its denial, is true.  Used for the cosmological argument.Marx.  alienation of labor.  By selling the fruit of their labor for a wage, the laborer is unable to enjoy his labor nor the profit it produces.  Further, as the increase of wealth becomes the possession of the bourgeoisie, the workers are seen as expendable.Natural Theology.Necessity.  A necessary state of affairs is one that holds in all possible conditions.  Modal Logic concerns the state of possible worlds.Omniscience and Foreknowledge.  While affirmed by classical theism, it does raise some interesting challenges and clarifications.  If God is *out*side of time, can he know what happens *in* time?  Time is changing; God is not.  How can the two meet?  The most famous response is Boethuis.  All things are eternally present for God.  God sees everything at once and so doesnt force an action.  While a neat solution, this effectively guts any real definition of God and numerous biblical passages.  It also seems to posit the realm of the eternally appearing now as independent of Gods creating act.Ontotheology.  any metaphysical system that posits God as a solution to a problem (this has been sufficiently rebutted by Crisp and Rea.  It's not that criticisms of ontotheology are wrong, but that ""ontotheology"" gets tagged onto anything that the critic doesn't like).Rationality.  Measures how one believes, not what.  It is person- and situation-specific.  We trust the beliefs produced by our cognitive faculties unless we have good reason to reject them.  the problem with the evidentialists demand is that such evidence cannot be provided in a large number of cases with the cognitive faculties with which we have to work. If we were required to prove everything, there would be an infinite regress of provings.  We have been outfitted with cognitive faculties that produce beliefs we can reason from (80).  Thomas Reid, call your office.the sensus divinitas is one such reasonable belief.  a) most of our cognitive faculties produce beliefs immediately, without reasoning or evidence.  b) belief in God is more like belief in a person than a scientific hypothesis.Substance.  the stuff in which an individual things properties or attributes inhere.  However, it is difficult to distinguish between a substance of a thing and its properties.  How does one identify the substantial core in an object?Theodicy.  Rather than deal with logical problem-solving, thinkers like Brueggemann and Ricouer see it as lament.Truth.  Correspondence theories of truth face several challenges.  1) How do sentences (linguistic reality) correspond to facts (non-linguistic reality)?  There are answers to this question, both by medieval philosophers (truth as adequatio) and modern analytic theists (truth-makers connect the linguistic with the non-linguistic answer).  I wonder if James Smith wrote this entry and if so, would he address the huge problems coherentism faces?Criticism:  They seem to link Barth with the Social Trinitarians and the stressing of plurality of persons over unity of essence (89), but this is false.  Barth is usually accused of being a modalist!  In any sense, Barth preferred tropos hyparchos over person as a Trinitarian category.Uses humor: There is no philosophy, once discredited, that has not found influence among theologians (73).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTWUEXWIMUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664225241#wasThisHelpful","R2YTWUEXWIMUO","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Holy Scripture: to depict these texts in light of their divine self-communication (Webster 5).  It is a short-hand for the nature and function of these communicative acts.Scripture has its place as an act of the God who speaks to and sanctifies his people (8).  Webster makes an unusual move: he speaks of the sanctification of Scripture.  It is the holiness of Scripture which is an aspect of Gods using creaturely reality to attest to his revelation (this is what we normally call the self-attestation of Scripture).  The sanctification of Scripture always refers back to Gods activity.RevelationWebster notes a problem when revelation is collapsed into prolegomenal foundations: it isolates revelation from material dogmatic discussions (12).  Webster proposes an alternative, identifying revelation as the self-disclosure of the Triune God (13) in which God establishes mercy and fellowship with human beings.The content of revelation is Gods own proper reality (14).  It is divine self-presentation and not merely facts about God.  But not only is God not merely the content of revelation, he is the subject.  Further, revelation is not merely Gods self-displaying, but it is the establishing of fellowship and overcoming human opposition.  In fact, Webster concludes: revelation is reconciliation (17).  I disagree, but more on that later.SanctificationWebsters emphasis on the sanctification aspects of Holy Scripture is much appreciated.  Whatever else the Bible may mean in relation to political theology or historical criticism, if it is not first anchored in the sanctifying acts of God towards his people, then we have divorced Scripture from life.SCRIPTURE, CHURCH, AND CANONThe Church does not create Scripture, but is called into being by God the Word.  If it is called into being, it stands in the relation of hearing.  Webster notes, The churchs being is ectopic (47); its place is in the being and creative act of God the Word.Invisibility of the Church:  it is in-visible in that it is not identified/seen in the worlds social institutions.Apostolicity and Tradition: tradition is just as much an act of hearing than a fresh act of speaking (49).  Further, the churchs acknowledgment of Scriptures authority is not so much an act of self-government, but an exposure to judgment (57).CanonisationThe canon is an extension of Christs communicative presence in his church (58).  The Churchs speech is generated and controlled by Christs own self-utterance (60).We do not deny the canon is the churchs act; we are simply clarifying what kind of act it is (62). It is an act of assent rather than self-derived judgment.  It is an act of confession of that which precedes and imposes itself upon the church. It is an act of submission before it is an act of authority. The act of canonization has a backwards reference.  The church and all of its acts are ostensive--pointing above and beyond itself.Reading in the Economy of GraceGrace establishes fellowship (71). Reading erodes spontenaity and subjects the reader to different modes of learning.  Bonhoeffer: we must be wary of positing an archimedean point of judgment outside of Scripture.  We should inculcate a habit of listening that draws us into the story extra nos (83).self-interpreting: only so by virtue of its relation to God.Helpful PointsWebster avoids predicating divine attributes to Scripture; its relation to God is instrumental (23).  This might appear a sop to liberalism, but a moments reflection will prove its obvious point: No one believes the pages of the bible as such are divine, for they wear away (which an attribute like eternity cannot).  Therefore, the bible I have is a copy of something.  A copy of what, precisely?  This isnt Barthianism.  Its common-sense.  Lets go back to the Augustinian use of res/signs.  Whats so bad about looking at my individual copy of the Bible as a sign to Gods res?  I really dont see how one can avoid this conclusion.  We dont have the autographa, but if we want to maintain a strong doctrine of inspiration (or better, ex-piration), then we have to use some form of Augsutinian signs.Webster suggests we should prioritize the model of Scripture as prophetic testimony.  It fits in with speech-act concepts.  It is language that depicts a reality other than itself (23).  However, Webster suggest we best see Scripture as a means of grace (24).  What do we mean by means?  He warns us not to view means as something that makes the divine reality present where it wasnt present before, giving a quasi-divine and magical connotation to the means.DisagreementsWebster says revelation is reconciliation (16).  Does he mean all acts of revelation are reconciliatory?  Surely he cant mean that, because Paul says the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men (Romans 1:18).  This aspect of revelation is not saving.  It is judgmental and even damning.Practical conclusions:We should insist on Scripture in usu et actione (7).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VBRAF66J4PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521538467#wasThisHelpful","R21VBRAF66J4PO","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is vintage Clark: remarkably clear, mostly solid, and occasionally off.I do not have a problem with most of the book.  Clark responds to and surveys the inspiration debates plaguing 20th century Evangelicalism.  For those of us who are familiar with Carson/Woodbridge/Henry, we will recognize Clarks arguments.The problems:1. Does Clark deny analogical knowledge?  Its hard to say.  To be fair, he does affirm analogical knowledge of a sorts: Ordinary analogies are legitimate and useful, but they are so only because there is a univocal point of coincident meaning in the two parts (Clark 33).  Something just doesnt seem right.  Earlier Clark affirms a most important qualitative difference between the knowledge situation in the case of God and the knowledge situation for man (30).  I suppose the question is this:  what is this point of contact between God and man?  What is the univocal element?  If he says knowledge, then he begs the question.  Which aspect of knowledge is the univocal point?It will help to remember Clarks explanation of what makes something true.  Nothing can be called true in the literal sense of the term except the attribution of a predicate to a subject (25).  I dont really have a problem with this.  Its basic logic and epistemology.  Isolated terms are neither true or false.  Nothing is being predicated of them.  Fair enough.  With this in mind I think we can answer the question.  He concludes, But if a predicate does not mean the same thing to man as it does to God, then, if Gods meaning is the correct one, it follows that mans meaning is incorrect (32).This is unsettling but we will move on.  I think there is a more important issue in the following pages.  Clark appears to deny the correspondence theory of truth.  He writes, Suffice to say, if the mind has something that only corresponds to reality, it does not have reality.  And if it knows reality, there is no need for an extra something that corresponds to it (36).  And so we have abandoned all classical epistemology from Augustine onward.  Keeping in mind the signa/res dichotomy, Clark has collapsed the sign into the thing signified.  If we apply this method to ontology, all is collapsed into the One.  If we apply it to the sacraments, we have transubstantiation.  The sign is the thing signified.It appears, then, that Clark opts for a coherentist model of truth.  He doesnt say so, but I think this would be his position.  Coherentism isnt ipso facto wrong, but it is insufficient without a correspondence theory.  Coherentism only tells us of the doxastic relationships between beliefs.  It doesnt tell us whether (or how) a belief is true.  Further, a belief can be coherent and not really bear upon other beliefs in question.  I believe the proposition my door is brown.  How does that cohere with the proposition The Bible is axiomatically true?I dont want to leave on a negative note.  Clark anticipates a few moves in modern epistemology, such as the problem of criterion.  Lets look at the liberal claim that the Bible is symbolic of myth or something.  This was sex-fiend Paul Tillichs position.  Lets say the crucifixion never occured, but it symbolic of Gods love.  Is that a literal truth or a symbolic one?  If the latter, then Gods love must be symbolic of something, too.  But this new term must be symbolic of yet another term, and on to eternity (48).He also deals with the inane argument what good is an infallible bible without an infallible interpreter?  But as the history of post-Vatican II has shown, this is fraught with danger.  If the Bible requires an infallible interpretation, then the supposed infallible encyclical or council would also need an infallible interpreter.  Whoever this might be, his interpretation--also infallible--would require yet another infallible interpretation, and so on (124).ConclusionCan we recommend this work?  We can recommend it provided the reader is already familiar with Bavinck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WD3993FCSTPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940931990#wasThisHelpful","R1WD3993FCSTPL","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hasker gives a competent discussion of dualism, materialism, and the problems attendant to both positions.  He offers a third-way:emergentism:  The mind is distinct from the brain (73). Like magnetic fields are produced by objects, the mind is produced by the brain.  Or better: soul-field.Speculative criticisms of free will:  Hasker asserts that libertarianism is not Pure chance (44).  Okay.  I still ask, is mans decision to act floating in a realm of contingency?  I have not seen Hasker offer anything like Gods Providence to challenge this question.  I can only assume the answer is yes.Cons and ProsCons:Uneasy relationship between philosophy and theology.  I agree with Hasker that we shouldnt dismiss philosophy ala Karl Barth.  Its not clear, though, whom Hasker would allow to adjudicate competing claims.  He wants philosophy to be Free (23) from theology.  This unwittingly justified Van Tils (and even Schaeffers, yikes!) charges of autonomy.His opening chapter seemed to endorse a form of classical foundationalism.  I say seemed because he hinted at something like it but didnt develop it (a recurring problem in this book).If he is a foundationalist, and his project rests upon foundationalists assumptions, and if foundationalism is proved wanting, does his project necessarily fall as well?  Maybe.While he gives a lucid discussion of libertarian free will, its hard to see how Gods providence factors in.  In fact, he seems to rule it out:  he [the determinist] regards his efforts, choices, and actions as inevitable parts of the necessary and unalterable order of things (38). If I then add the verse, Declaring the end from the beginning (Is. 46:10), its hard to see how Hasker can give that verse anything but poetic exaggeration.  He does deal with predestination, but dismisses it (and divine foreknowledge) outright (51).Hasker at this point in his career (1983) does not accept open theism, but he is pretty close (He denies that God knows future contingencies, p.53.  Hasker holds that, but offers another argument:  Divine Timelessness.  God doesnt know my future actions because there is no future for God.  This is hard for the reader of Paul to accept, chosen before the foundation of the world).The book is outdated beyond repair.  The bibliography has few works past 1979.  I dont want to be a chronological snob, but its hard to do philosophy of religion without interacting with Plantinga or the a-theologians (Dawkins, Dennet).ProsWhile his brevity is fatal to his work in some areas, it does make it relatively easy to read. In this sense the book is a good intro to the subject--but only that.  The book is decently written and accessible, something few--if any--books on metaphysics can say.I found his take on emergentism as a solution to the mind-body problem interesting.  I think there are difficulties, and I suspect that communicative categories are superior, but I wont dismiss it outright.He gives a number of interesting criticisms of pan(en)theism and process theology that I hadnt thought of (if we are part of God and we get saved, is God saving himself?  If not everyone is saved, then is part of God damned?)Should you get the book?  Sure, Why not?  It is cheap, well-written, and accessible.  However, it is woefully inadequate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJRSSSZI9ZF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0877843414#wasThisHelpful","R1CJRSSSZI9ZF8","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Peter Kreefts abridged commentary on Blaise Pascals Pensees.  How shall one evaluate this?  Pascal stands or falls on his own, so the majority of this review will focus on Kreefts project. To borrow Chalcedonian categories, Kreeft is 100% brilliant and 100% naive.ScopeKreeft suggests that Pascal is the first post-medieval apologist, and there is something to that observation.  The medieval synthesis is irreparably destroyed.  Modern man has moved from place to space.  It is Pascals genius to see that.  As such, the arguments are not so much arguments for Gods existence et al, but arguments for faith within the Christian system.  With Pascal apologetics takes on a keen psychological turn.Throughout we get a number of incisive comments on the mind-body problem, universals, and tips for good writing.  Kreeft includes Pascals perceptive (and quite modern) comments on the Jews. Of course, Pascals Wager is legendary and Kreeft does a good job with it. Space forbids a full review, unfortunately.StructureThis book is a psychological prolegomena to theology.My problem with the books format is sometimes I forget if I am reading Kreeft or Pascal (Pascals text is in bold-print) and sometimes Pascals comments get lost in Kreefts explanations.Evaluation[A]Kreeft is the master of the well-turned phrase.  And when you juxtapose him with Pascal, himself a pithy wordsmith, the effect is something else.[B]However, while Kreeft is a master communicator, he is not a master at historical theology.  I do not fault him because he holds to Roman catholicism.  His problem is playing fast and loose with issues that are painfully complex.  Its not simply sloppy scholarship.  Its historically irresponsible (since souls are on the line).[C]Kreeft writes, Contrary to Calvinism, Catholicism teaches that our first nature remains good beneath our sin nature (Kreeft 161).  But Confessional Protestantism does not teach that our human nature is one blob of sin.  It is good.  The sin is in the accidens and relatio (schizein; Formula of Concord, I:24-25).[D]I understand that as a Roman apologist Kreeft holds to Purgatory.  That is his prerogative.  What is troubling is the pithy way he tries to prove it while ignoring close to 1,000 years of strike and counter-strike against purgatorial arguments (see Mark of Ephesus in Eastern Orthodoxy). Kreeft writes, That is why we need Purgatory: to become the kind of creature that would not wither and die when we meet God...Do you really think you are ready to stand in that light? If you do, then you are proud and not ready (254).[~D]Here is a thought:  what if when God sees me he sees Jesus?  Is Jesus good enough?  Jesus + 0, right? I realize this isnt a full-orbed defense of Christs active obedience, but it is a sufficient rebuttal to Kreefts arguments for Purgatory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WTUGP5X82URG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898704529#wasThisHelpful","R2WTUGP5X82URG","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Time and a second reading, along with various shifts in worldview, can fundamentally alter one's perception of an author. My first experience with Moreland and Craig, Moreland in particular, was *Love your God with all Your Mind.* Despite the title's fluffy, evangelicalish devotional appeal, LYGWALM actually was very rigorous and probably did more for getting my intellectual life started than anything else.I decided to read everything by Moreland (and Craig). Since *Philosophical Foundations of a Christian Worldview* had just come out in 2003, I felt it would be a good text to read.When I got it though, I experienced several let-downs. It was waay over my head. And the parts I did understand I had to reject: Molinism and the classical arguments for the existence of God. I began studying ethics and Moreland/Craig's section on ethics, emphasizing the roles of normative, situational, and personal ethics, was outstanding.The Book's Highpoints:1. Excellent, if somewhat intellectually painful, chapter on how to do logic. Be warned, this is very, very hard to read.  That being said, once you understand modal logic and possible worlds semantics, multiple levels of reality are now opened.  I read the chapter eight or nine times before it ""clicked.""  Once it did, though...2. Gives a good discussion on whether knowledge is really ""justified, true belief.""3. Introduces the reader to the categories of time, substance, and space.4. Very good internal critique of Scient(ISM)'s presuppositions. Completely defangs modern science.5. Excellent discussion on the nature of ethical reasoning.6. Good critique of the Western doctrine of Absolute Divine Simplicity.Cons of the Book:1. This book is simply too hard and inaccessible as an intro text.  On the other hand, it is outstanding as a mid-level text.2. I admit--I now see that their proofs for the existence of God are logically compatible. I reject the presuppositional critique of the Five ways.3. The chapter on Molinism is very interesting.  As it stands, I am not convinced.  I wonder if one links middle-knowledge with Plantinga's possible-worlds semantics if it could work.Conclusion:As a reference resource, this book is outstanding. However, to fully understand what they are saying, one needs to read upper-level philosophy and theology for about a year (I had to study for three or four years) to really understand what they are","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BB36RCSY9KJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830826947#wasThisHelpful","R2BB36RCSY9KJF","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And so begins Plantingas vaunted Warrant Trilogy. Reviewing this work presents some challenges for me. I read the books in reverse order (WCB, WPF, and finally WCD). Therefore, I have to resist the urge to fault Plantinga in WCD for leaving some points undeveloped when I know he developed them in WPF.Plantinga begins his work by outlining what internalism entails. Internalism implies knowledge as justification. I am justified in knowing something if I have fulfilled my epistemic duty with regard to that knowledge. It is internal because it suggests special epistemic access.Justification:Connection between justification and knowledgeConnotes epistemic responsibilityInternal cognitive accessMatch up with evidenceInternalism is often linked with classical or modern foundationalism. The ground of a beliefs justification is the same as the property by which I determine if I am justified in holding it (Plantinga 21).Ordinary Foundationalism: The evidence of basis on which I form a belief is taken from other, logically prior beliefs. Beliefs that I do not accept on the basis of other beliefs are basic beliefs (68). A foundationalist will reject circular reasoning.Another epistemological model is coherentism. Coherentism is not foundationalism. A coherentist will hold that belief B is properly basic for person S [iff] B coheres with the rest of Ss noetic structure. Coherentism is not concerned about the transmission of warrant but of its source (79).Plantinga gives a number of reasons on why these internalist models fail. He then moves to externalist models.EXTERNALISMI do not have to have some internal access to truth-making functions. Plantinga lists Aristotle (de Anima and Posterior Analytics II) and Aquinas (ST 1 q. 84, 85) as externalists (183ff). Externalism is correct about warrant (if only as a denial of internalism). Most externalist models, however, do not (yet) offer strong enough systems.What is reliabilism then?1.1 Alstonian JustificationA person is justified in believing a proposition only if she believes it on the basis of a reliable indicator. But what is justification? A belief is justified if it is accepted on rational grounds accessible to the knower.B. Questions about Alstonian JustificationB.1. Where does justification come from? Alston tries to distance himself from the received tradition which locates justification with deontological norms. Alston does not seem to think that justification (or warrant) is necessary for knowledge (An Internalist Externalism, Synthese 74 no. 3, p. 281).B.2 Not sufficient for warrant. Ss belief that p is Alston-justified if it is accessible to S and is a reliable indicator of the truth of p. Plantinga points out that a number of beliefs could meet this condition but have no warrant (Plantinga 191). Something could be a reliable indicator of the truth but I could believe it on the basis of cognitive malfunction. A belief can be reliable by accident.Evaluation:Pro--Plantinga does a masterful job in what the title suggests: he summarizes the current debate concerning warrant and justification. In that he succeeds. Further, no matter how arcane or technical a discussion is, Plantinga always begins the chapter by reviewing what internalism, deontology, justification, and warrant mean at said point in the discussion.Further, Plantingas discussion of key individuals can also serve as an entry-point for the reader to continue the study.Con--I am not persuaded that some chapters were entirely relevant. Coherentism as an epistemology is important, but nobody cares about Bayesianism Coherentism. I seriously doubt the reader will come across a person who really understands Bayes Theorem and why it matters for your life. As such, the book could have been 40 pages shorter","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WI404HW49P9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195078624#wasThisHelpful","R2WI404HW49P9D","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its hard to put the books importance into words, which makes writing this review rather difficult.  One has to start somewhere, I suppose.  Moreland and Rae (hereafter MR) argue for a form of Thomistic substance dualism in their doctrine of human nature.  Accordingly, the soul is an individuated essence that makes the body a human body (MR 202).States and faculties of the soul: The soul has capacities.  Capacities come in hierarchies. 1st order hierarchy: a capacity that is realized. 2nd order: capability faculty: a faculty is a compartment of the soul that contains a natural family of related capacities (204). The key word here is capacities.  Fetuses and those on life-support have the latent capacity for the later functions of personhood.  What all this means is, contra to any form of naturalism, the soul is an essence that survives change.  It cannot be reduced to a form of different functions.Such an entity has the ability to make rational choices.Further, personhood is something that is absolute, not degreed.  Here MR are following the lead of Thomas Reid and most of Christendom.  commonsense view (Reid, Butler).  Persons differ from physical artifacts in that they maintain absolute sameness through change. Leibnizs law holds between all the moments a person exists except tenses. PI is unanalyzable and primitive.  It cannot be broken down further.Moreover, Leibnizs law states (x)(y)[(x=y)--->(P)(Px<-->Py)]; For any x, and for any y, if they are identical to each other, then for any property P, P will be true of x iff P is true of y.  This means, negatively, that the soul is not the same thing as the body.  The person is not the same thing as the body.  Positively, a person maintains identity over time, a position that scientific naturalism really cant account for.Applied EthicsThe second half of the book takes the Thomistic doctrine and applies it to abortion and end-of-life debates.  Scott Rae is the main contributor in this section.  He analyzes a number of pro-abortion arguments and notes that they all hinge on a defective view of the person. most abortion-rights advocates define personhood in terms of a set of functions or actualized capacities.  The problem with this approach is that it logically justifies killing:**mentally handicapped and the newborn (its not clear at what age infants can meet reasoning capacities to justify their living)**Abortion-rights advocates are unable to tell at what point a developing human becomes a person.**Newborns have sentience, but so do unborn.  Isnt it somewhat arbitrary for abortion advocates to draw the line at breaching the vagina as suddenly okay to live?.  [But even here, pro-abortion logic breaks down, given our Presidents ghoulish endorsement of killing babies who have breached the vagina]**Functionalist definitions of personhood presuppose a property-thing ontology, rather than a substance one.**A person under general anesthesia cannot function.  Does he cease to be a person?  Why not?  As Rae notes, To appeal to some higher-order capacities as determinate of personhood cannot be done without acknowledging that personhood is not dependent on lower-order capacities (Moreland and Rae 251).  These higher-order capacities are latent, just as they are with the unborn.There is a rather interesting chapter on genetic cloning.  The main question is whether clones have souls.  Noting the difficulty of answering this question, the authors conclude probably.The book ends with a powerful chapter on end-of-life ethics.EvaluationMoreland in particular writes with Kingdom Power.  I learned more philosophical terminology in one week studying and outlining this book than I did in the previous year.  And this philosophy isnt arcane.  It literally is life-and-death.  Because of this book I feel confident in giving coherent and rational responses in the abortion debate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GVD3N0FDXZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830815775#wasThisHelpful","R26GVD3N0FDXZ1","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Piper's contribution to the growing body of literature on the life of the mind.  While I'm glad I read it, I don't think it is the best take on the subject.  That would be J. P. Moreland's Love Your God With all Your Mind.  Next would be James Sire's *Habits of the Mind.*Pros:*The chapter on relativism was good, and I was pleased that Piper didn't immediately identify relativism with ""postmodernism.""  I am no frirend of postmoderns, to be sure, but the two aren't the same.*I found his exegetical points insightful*He did a good and responsible job of handling the ""Hebraic vs. Hellenistic"" dichotomy, falsely so-called.  I do think there are slight nuances between the two categories of thought, but Piper shows how Jesus used ""Aristotelian"" logic, which means tere is probably more overlap than once suspected.Cons:~The book had the feel of a collection of old sermons and blog posts.~There weren't many practical guidelines on ""cultivating the life of the mind.""  This is where Moreland and Sire excel.~(This next point isn't so much a criticism as an observation).  Towards the end of the book Piper listed a number of challenges to the Evangelical faith (Open Theism, Feminism, Roman catholicism, etc).  I agree with his concerns, but I am not too sure if that was the best part to introduce new material.  I don't want to go too far with this criticism, though.  When I was in college this was exactly the battle lines we Evangelicals faced.  Piper is accurate as far as it goes, but one wonders why he waited until the end of the book to bring it up.  When I did this on seminary and college papers, I got docked points.Conclusion:It's worth reading and I did learn some new things.  It's even available for free at Desiring God.  I don't think it is the best, though.  I highly recommend getting Moreland and Sire and spending a few weeks just meditating through the passages (and to be fair, Piper recommends both Moreland and Sire).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHE15E77Z3871/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433523183#wasThisHelpful","RHE15E77Z3871","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He has a beautiful chapter on solitude and silence.  My only concern is that it is completely unworkable to anyone who has kids, a job with pressing demands, or both.  This leads to the uncomfortable conclusion that there is okay spirituality, which is the basic stuff someone like you does every day (read the bible, pray, etc), and then there is next level spirituality for those unhampered by kids or work.  Of course, this sounds exactly like monasticism.  To be fair, Willard is not arguing for this point, but this is precisely the direction the early church took it.Towards a Christian AnthropologyIn technical language, Willard is a soul-substance dualist, which is generally the Christian position. The soul is a substance in that it is an individual entity that has properties and dispositions natural to it, endures through time and change, and receives and exercises causal influence on other things (Willard 139).We have knowledge of a subject matter when we are able to represent it as it in fact is, on an appropriate basis of thought and experience (140)It is the source of life (143).The spirit is a central part of the soul, the part of determination (is this what Dabney called connative powers?).  It is the heart or will.  This isnt trichotomism, though.  Trichotomism sees the spirit as a separate entity.  This view sees it as a subdivision of the soul.The Good in the bookLogic as a spiritual discipline.  This was a wonderful chapter, Jesus the Logician.It requires the will to be logical (182).freedom from distractionwillingness to follow truth wherever it takesCommitted to logic as a fundamental value (183).  Jesus uses enthymemes. He understates logical points which require the hearer to draw the conclusion--psychologically, this was a very effective move.As noted previously, his take on anthropology and its suggestions for a Christian psychology was wonderful.  And despite his weak soteriology, he upheld the law-gospel distinction (162).CriticismsDangerous models:Per Laubach:  language of ascent to God (200).  This is chain-of-being ontology.  Note how the Christian logic works.  We do not ascend to God.  Christ descends to us.  I understand that inner language has Augustinian precedents.This theme is heavier in Teresa of Avilas Interior Castle.  The rooms are ways of living in relation to God.  Interestingly, Willard notes that this book has become an interfaith manual.  Ironically, or perhaps precisely because when the spiritual life becomes mystical absorption into the One, then why does it really matter which One it is?And this problem surfaces in many of Willards works.  He tries to mix and match spiritualities, but spirituality cannot be isolated from a larger theology.  There is much that is valuable, even outstanding in this work.  There is also much that is dangerous.The biggest problem, though, is Willards ambiguity regarding soteriology.  Granted, he is responding to the happy-clappy, let go and let God Christian, it remains that he is not always clear on the relation between justification and sanctification.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKIZVVHKL2YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062311751#wasThisHelpful","R2RKIZVVHKL2YA","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alston begins on a promising note: defend the reality of truth as corresponding to an extra-mental state of affairs.  His Thesis: alethic realism; sees truth in the sense of a statement is true iff what is said to be the case actually is the case (Alston 5).  Interestingly, Alston contrasts his model with epistemic accounts of truth--those accounts that see truth has needing internal access or justification.Does he deliver?  Kind of.  Some chapters are quite complex (convoluted?) and I am not entirely sure what is going on (more on that below).  Other chapters, such as the ones on justification and metaphysical realism, are quite fascinating, but even then there is a problem: Alston will then say the conclusion to the previous discussion isnt necessary to alethic realism.  Not surprisingly, this is a disappointment to the reader.Alstons two sub-theses:Our concept of a propositions is a concept of the content of a belief (2).Our basic grip on propositions is by way of their furnishing content for illocutionary acts and propositional attributes (Alston 20).Alston calls this position an inchoate correspondence theory,  and I think he is correct in where he takes it.  From here he examines alternative models offered by Quine, Putnam and others.  To be honest, I am not entirely sure what those discussions were about.EvaluationMy confusion over the books flow is not unique to me.  Alston mentions another review who admitted the same thing (quoted on p. 263).  I agree with a mild form of epistemological realism, and I even agree with a moderate metaphysical realism.  I simply think Alston could have established his thesis in only 150 pages, if that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4B1IMPOXTZVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801484103#wasThisHelpful","R4B1IMPOXTZVG","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IntroductionThe book is an honest critique.  Nothing more, nothing less. Carson begins gently and then pulls no punches.The Problem of DefinitionSo what is emergent or postmodernism?  This is an annoying question because at any moment in the critique, someone can say, Yeah, but thats not our position.  Emergent is easy enough to define.  Most of the emergent guys write books with emergent in the titles, so we can assume that is their position.  Postmodernism on the other hand, is a thorny problem.  It is not synonymous with relativism nor are all postmodern philosophers saying the same thing.But this might not be an insurmountable problem.  Emergent guys play off postmodernism as the Other of modernism.  That might be a workable enough definition.Where the Emergent Church Accidentally gets it rightIts not all bad.  And not all emergent guys are Obama-voting hyper-relativists.  It is true that our world is changing and simply opting to have more Sunday School rallies wont win the lost and wont even make a dent in culture.  No argument here.  Further, with regards to epistemology, we can agree that we are indeed finite knowers, and any act of knowing is already always an act of knowing-at-a-specific-moment-and-a-specific-place.  We didnt need MacIntyre to tell us that (however interesting his work is).Postmodernisms Story of PhilosophyThis is where the Emergent Church gets it badly wrong.  Or at least they are irresponsible.  The EC tends to read anyone who doesnt hold to post-foundationalism as holding to an extreme form of Cartesian Rationalism.  Yet I dont know any solid Evangelical that did this, not even Carl F Henry.Carsons CritiqueThis section was masterful.  I stood in awe.  Carson called them out on their shallow readings of modernity (and a slight point of correction.  Both Carson and Emergent guys kept saying modernism instead of modernity.  Modernism is a literary response to modernity)  .Not only are EC guys irresponsible in historiography and philosophy, they are sloppy in hermeneutics and ethics.  Carsons section on the hermeneutical spiral was simply brilliant.The EC hasnt shown the contradiction between a) affirming objective reality and b) acknowledging we are finite knowers.  If (a)-(b) hold, then the following works:(c ) there can be accurate statements about the world, truth, religion.In fact, EC guys will make value judgments about George W.

"Some sections were dense sledding, like the one on sense perception.  Still, even those sections were worth it. I found his discussion on John Locke very clear and introductory, allowing one to move to a reading of Locke himself.  In the first few chapters Audi is trying to show that memory, perception, and testimony serve as sources of belief, if not intended to serve as foundations.Audi gives us a fine discussion on justified, true belief and the architecture of knowledge.  This leads to the discussion of internalism vs. externalism and how that entails/shapes other beliefs.The two chapters on skepticism were good and the reader is aware of all the problems as a result: problem of other minds; problem of induction, etc. He ends with a decent (if inadequate at points) rebuttal to skepticism: if skepticism is true, can I know that I am thinking about skepticism?  He offers a positive defense of common-sense (though not necessarily the Reidian variety). one does not have to have the KK principle: knowing entails knowing that one knows.  This leads to an infinite regress.Observations*Ironically, sometimes Audis endnotes are more enlightening than the main argument themselves.*The book end with a wonderful annotated bibliography (the inclusion of which is what separates great books from good books).*The section on testimony was quite good.  He did note Reids contributions and he did deal with Plantinga, but I think his chapter would have been stronger if Audi reworked the argument to say that one is warranted by having a prima-facie credulity in testimony until sufficient defeaters prove otherwise.*Sometimes when the narrative appears to get bogged down in highly technical details, Audi will rescue the argument with a subsequently fine chapter.  This keeps the reader from despairing.*As every reviewer has noted, the prose is painful.  To be fair I am not sure how this could have been otherwise.  This is a highly technical and advanced (the subtitle notwithstanding) book on a specific subset of philosophy.  Its going to be hard reading no matter what.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C96FARJ8X6WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415281091#wasThisHelpful","R1C96FARJ8X6WA","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Moreland's follow-up to his watershed-work ""Love your God with all your Mind."" The triangle is knowledge/virtue/power, and the book is thus organized.The Crisis:Western world, under the influence over Evolutionary Naturalism (whatever exists can only be known by scientific means), has seen the loss of a real, non-empirical yet accessible body of knowledge. As a result, this world has no objective value. Moreland then runs a brutal critique of naturalism: naturalism cannot account for consciousness, human willing, responsibility, and intrinsic value.  Naturalism is a demonic stronghold and Moreland has cast it down (2 Cor 10)Postmodernism is naturalism's shadow. Both deny the reality of objective, non-empirical knowledge. This section is tricky. What is postmodernism? Moreland tends to assume it is relativism, but the French school by and large rejected relativism. Moreland then links it with the Emergent Church. That's one school, perhaps a large one. We will assume that is what postmodernism means at the moment.Moreland quickly disposes of postmodernism, mainly the EC variety.The Solution.1. The recovery of knowledge. Moreland defines knowledge as justified, true belief. This seems to place him in the classical foundationalist, internalist school. There are difficulties with such an approach, yet when Moreland furthers explains his position, it seems like he is defining knowledge as Warranted belief. He notes that certainty is not always necessary and that knowledge can grow by degrees. He further responds to skepticism by adhering to Thomas Reid's particularism. Throughout this section are excellent technical discussions.2. Virtue Ethics. He examines the ""Empty Self"" concept (e.g., the Kardashians) and contrasts it with the ancient understanding of happiness as virtue. This was Christianized into ""Eternal Life.""3. Kingdom Power. Here Moreland defends continuationism. He doesn't so much argue the case as present an overwhelming amount of anecdotal evidence. He does point to where both cessationists and continuationists have overreacted to each other. While this chapter is probably weaker on the logical arguments, he does offer an interesting exegetical insight concerning the Gospel of the Kingdom. : the reign and rule of God available in Jesus Christ. God has power over demons, darkness, and disease.Interestingly, this is why hard-line dispensationalists will not sing the praise hymn, ""Majesty."" One of the lines is ""Kingdom Authority."" But dispensationalists note that Jesus isn't seated on David's throne. If he were, then the Kingdom has indeed come in power and believers would have access to that power.I'm not arguing for or against Moreland on this point. I do think MacArthur's Strange Fire was a really bad critique and contra the backslapping, fewer and fewer scholars hold to cessationism.Conclusion:This book was as exciting as his prequel. Moreland has effectively destroyed naturalism, which is the worldview of CNN, Oprah, and the Beltway Alliance. I hope he doesn't end up in a FEMA camp. Until then, if you master Moreland's arguments, you too can stand in the gap and put the CNN anchors to route.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Y2VV7MA8PGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031027432X#wasThisHelpful","R36Y2VV7MA8PGI","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sourcebook is divided into five parts: The Patristic Age, Late Antiquity and Germanic Kingship, The Integration of Aristotle, Spiritual Polities and Dominum, and Renaissance and reformation.  At the risk of sounding Hegelian (purely accidental) we see the ODonovans guiding us through the struggles each age had to face in integrating biblical truth, not only with their present culture, but with the achievements of previous ages.The Patristic AgeChristian thinkers had to wrestle with the uncomfortable fact that the NT praised Roman soldiers with the present reality of Romes attack on the faith.  Further, military service, whatever conclusion one reached, challenged ideas of continuity.Eschatology factored heavier in these accounts.  As a separate community living in the time between the times, they awaited the arrival of Yahweh and the judgment of the age.  This sheds light on the confrontational (spiritual, anyway) atmosphere:  thinkers like Irenaeus and Cyril of Jerusalem saw a coming showdown with Antichrist (quoted in ODonovan 41).The Transition:  Towards the end of the age both East and West will have been shaped by Justinians Law.  The West would move to see links between Christology and political imagination (cf Kantorowicz)Reformation and BeyondExpanding exploration and new markets forced a rethinking of many theories, particularly those of ius naturale and ius gentium (ODonovan 549).  The idea of covenant began to play a more prominent role (per Knox and Junius Brutus) in how one relates to kings.  On the Romanist and Anglican sides, develops in Thomism provided new reflections.ObservationsIt took me ten years to work through this book, but I think it was worth it.  Occasionally ODonovan might cook the evidence when it comes to political economy, and perhaps he doesnt include all our favorite theologians, but given the limitations I dont see how it could possibly be any better.  Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VAXA1GEW1DPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802842097#wasThisHelpful","R2VAXA1GEW1DPN","A3O7YUO9O08K95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O7YUO9O08K95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seishuu Handa is 23 years old and already a master calligrapher, but his achievements and awards fail to impress a gallery director who calls his work contrived and dull. Getting caught up in the insult to his pride, he punches the director and is sent by his father to an isolated island village to ""cool his head"" and ""overcome his flaws as a human being."" Peace and quiet isn't in the forecast though, as the house he's renting has been claimed by the rambunctious six-year old Naru as a base for her and her friends.Barakamon has a number of unusual elements that give it a nice twist on the ""city slicker comes to the country"" cliche at its core. The calligraphy aspect is unique and well integrated into both the main character's personality and the plot of the manga. The culture clash isn't too overdone and Naru and the villagers are quirky and endearing (for the most part). The humor has a subtle feel and generally works. There's also nice underlying themes of what success really means and the value of creativity and individuality.There a couple of small drawbacks here worth mentioning though. The pace feels a bit frantic for some reason to me. It never really achieved that laid back feel the best slice-of-life stories have. It could be stemming from the main characters' ""auras."" Seishuu's low-self esteem makes him sensitive and gruff to the point of unlikeability sometimes. I understand characters need flaws, it's an important part of the premise, and he always apologizes, but the way it's done made him a little off-putting as a point of view character. Connected to this is Naru's constant presence despite being told to leave his home. Again, I understand someone needs to break him out of his shell and that Naru is cheerful, amusing and innocent-natured in her intrusions, but the approach makes her annoying at times. To be clear they're fine main characters overall and I did enjoy the manga. The disconnect here is likely growing pains as Yoshino finds his characters' voices as well as the effect of the unavoidable comparisons of Haru to Yotsuba, which is an incredibly high measuring stick.Barakamon is a fairly original slice-of-life manga highly reminiscent of, if not yet quite reaching the heights of, great works such as Yotsuba&! and Bunny Drop. I'm definitely interested in reading more and seeing if the potential here can be fully realized.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F907VSFOQG3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOT9LVW#wasThisHelpful","R2F907VSFOQG3H","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book. This has in no way influenced my review.The Teen Titans are back in another version of their cartoon series (at the expense of my beloved Young Justice, but that's another story). Teen Titans Go! is is a zany, madcap show with the emphasis firmly on humor and this trade collects issues #1-6 of the tie-in comic book (with each issues having two stories). Yes, a comic based on a tv version of a comic book team. You get used to it.""Tie-in"" isn't a perfect description in this case. There's no real overarching plot to the series so there's no depth to be added or mysteries to explain here. This is quite simply more ""episodes"" shared in comic form. The art is very true to show as well. In fact it almost does too good a job copying the feel of the show overall - the adventures here are almost redundant since set-ups and gags are recycled with frequency in both. Without voices, music, etc to jazz things up there's a spark missing here that heightens the enjoyment of the cartoon.But again this is a faithful adaptation of the shows characters and humor. As with any comedy it's hit or miss and entirely personal preference, but I found a few of the stories extremely funny and a number of amusing moments throughout the trade.So nothing Earth-shattering and some of the jokes are eye-roll inducing, but if you're a fan of the show and/or up for some light, brainless humor there are laughs to be had here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SM6UI15NGUBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401252427#wasThisHelpful","R1SM6UI15NGUBA","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final volume of a layered, intricate story that has been carefully built since the beginning. There's no point starting here - this really must be read from volume 1.No detailed summary this time. It's simply the final showdown with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Cliched as that sounds, the specifics of Ageha's journey and the world of Psyren make this gripping and compelling to the last page. The various distinct, conflicting agendas intersect perfectly in the climax to provide a finale that is fitting and consistent with the series that preceded it.On the critical side, a ridiculous amount is packed into the last couple of volumes and they do feel a little rushed. Another volume or two for this last arc would not have been out of place. There are also a few open questions and subplots I wish got a bit more development. That said, these are minor issues. Every major plot thread is addressed and the resolutions are character-driven and satisfying. A couple things wrap up a little too neatly, but I'd much rather that than too many loose ends.The best part about this finale is that Iwashiro still had a couple of surprises to share without anything coming out of left field. Having logical progression and good foreshadowing without telegraphing everything is very difficult and the repeated success achieved in Psyren is one of the things I love most about the series.A fitting end to a fantastic manga.

They'll need all the help they can get...This is what I was cautiously hoping for in a penultimate volume for this manga. The action is full bore over-the-top (in the best possible sense), some long-running issues are resolved in unexpected, satisfying ways, and the conflicts all build up to a big cliffhanger for the final volume. There are genuine surprises here and complex characters on both sides that heighten the impact of both the action and the plot developments. The pace is appropriately frantic and chaotic, but never to the point of losing the reader. A few big questions remain, but given the careful way major issues were worked into this volume I have no doubt we'll get all the resolutions due in the finale.As Psyren's long, twisted ride draws to a conclusion we're rewarded with one of the best volumes of the series yet.

But something else happens first - another visit from Nemesis Q...This is more like it. We're back to Psyren, the villains are on the offensive, and interesting questions and themes are being weaved into the narrative. I missed The Root and it's great to see the associated characters again. There's some fallout from Ageha meeting Avis, causing cascading relationship tension between Ageha and Sakurako which leads to complications with Mari. It's done realistically and helps flush out the personalities and engage the reader.Other than what appears to be the beginning of a huge battle the big draw in this volume are the lingering open questions about the effects of time travel and a couple of small but very important revelations in that vein. I hoping everything will be tied together and explained because the mysteries throughout this series have been the best part and I'm very curious to discover all the ""solutions.""

The side story here lacks the immediacy and intrigue other such diversions have had that kept them feeling vital and compelling. The action is solid and there's nothing really bad, but being focused entirely on supporting cast, featuring the antagonists point of view, and setting up things we already know are coming makes this all feel pretty bland. Things do pick up a bit at the end when a new lead on Miroku's past in the Grigori Project is discovered.

"This trade contains The Demon Annual #2, material from The Batman Chronicles #4, and Hitman #1-3.In 1993 DC had an event running through their annuals called Bloodlines, where parasitic aliens attacked Earth, consumed people's spinal fluid, and ended up giving a subset of their victims superpowers. In this way each annual intruded a new superhero or super-villain. Yeah. So moving on...There's was one success story in the bunch - the Demon Annual introduced Tommy Monaghan, a street level assassin with some morals caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tommy's resulting powers (telepathy and x-ray vision) are cliche, but given to a hitman they become fresh and intriguing. Hi battle with the alien parasite and interactions with Jason Blood are well done and Ennis already seemed to be planting seeds for a larger story.Tommy is based in Gotham, so naturally a big part of his early adventures featured run-ins with the caped crusader. The included story here from Batman Chronicles is their first encounter, and is perfect as such. It's a skirmish, just a taste of what a bigger conflict would be like between the two, and further establishes Tommy's approach and character traits, both positive and negative.Finishing this collection is the first three issues of Hitman's ongoing series, comprising a single storyline called A Rage in Arkham. Ennis clearly starts settling in for the long haul by introducing a supporting cast, illustrating Tommy's devotion to only killing those who ""deserve it,"" and establishing the tone and atmosphere for the book. Hitman is not a normal DCU title (an was even less so at the time), edging more towards the themes, style and body count one would find in a Vertigo title. This is a good opening for the comic, with a high profile target for Tommy, more focus on his attempts to sidestep Batman's attention, and external forces at work.The art is decent. Character designs are often exaggerated for effect and the style takes a little getting used to, but it works for the story being told and the use of shadow to enhance tension and atmosphere is amazing.Though this volume is largely set-up and the issues of the ongoing are a step above the introductory material that proceed them, it's nice to have it all together and overall this was a strong start to the adventures of one of DC's most unlikely ""heroes"" ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZL2XPQS42OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563893142#wasThisHelpful","R2UZL2XPQS42OU","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final volume of this short manga. No point starting here - read from the beginning.After a strange encounter with a generous sinner and her demon, Rintaro ends up completing odd jobs for various demons are his city. Throughout the associated mischief, he becomes increasingly obsessed with why he was sent to hell and finding out what his sin was. Numerous plot threads from previous volumes come together in Love in Hell's conclusion. Rintaro's sin and the specifics of his situation are both logically built and shocking. Though there are still touches of humor things get much more serious and darker as the story builds to a climax. The focus is tight in the second half of this volume and it really adds to the suspense and impact.Surprisingly (given the previous volumes) Suzumaru is still finding ways to make his story creepier and more grotesque. I can't begin to properly convey how disturbing certain things were, and the worst of the bunch didn't even have visuals (for obvious reasons). It's all important to the story and the characters, but be warned we're talking the stuff nightmares are made of here.While a great number of details from earlier in the series proved significant and the main plot came together wonderfully, there were characters and events I expected to have significance that didn't pop up again. Certain aspects of Hell and its rules could've used more explanation.It's a sign of a strong finish when my biggest criticism is that the concept and characters could've easier supported a longer series. This volume is darker and more intense and the usual subject matter warnings apply even more than usual, but overall Love in Hell comes to a great conclusion here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRX69R2NZKLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626920141#wasThisHelpful","R1VRX69R2NZKLT","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It wouldn't be too hard to pick up the gist of the premise from what's here but there is an ongoing plot and as this series is only three volumes long there's no real point in starting in the middle. Read from volume 1.Rintaro thinks he's getting used to Hell, but there are several less than pleasant surprises in store for him about its true nature and what's expected of him. The tales here grow even more grotesque and unsettling than previously, both in visuals and underlying content. There's a good deal of foreshadowing and several hints about how everything might come together in future chapters. Rintaro continues to be a jerk, but mostly from frustration and trouble accepting his situation. One of the best things about the way things are unfolding is watching the small glimmers of progress and potential he shows. Despite heavy topics and disturbing events there is still a strong layer of humor throughout most of the volume. A couple of developments in the last few pages build a ton of intrigue for the upcoming conclusion.Love in Hell is equal parts twisted, repulsive, hilarious and engaging. It's a strange mix, but quite entertaining if you can stomach it and this volume builds momentum nicely going into the finale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VNV4K627O3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937867994#wasThisHelpful","R28VNV4K627O3M","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rintaro is a 20-something ""regular guy"" who drank too much one night, fell, hit head, and died. Convinced he'd done nothing wrong in his life and expecting to enter Heaven, Rintaro is unpleasantly shocked to wake up in hell instead under the watch of a young, meek, scantily clad demon named Koyori. Can Rintaro control his impulses, behave, and earn his way out of hell? Will he stop fooling around enough to even care?At the core of Love in Hell is the concept that sinners can atone (as well as making their life more comfortable in hell) by suffering. Each soul is assigned to a caretaker demon who is responsible for their rehabilitating, primarily through helping them suffer, i.e. torturing them. The various horrible things they are subjected to are graphically depicted, and there is also a lot of nudity and ecchi situations. This is about as close as a manga can get to being hentai without crossing the line.The key that makes this all work is that Love in Hell is a comedy. Everything is exaggerated and over-the-top to the point of ridiculousness, which takes a lot of the edge off. As with most comedies some of the jokes really click and some are too much/not funny, but I found more of it worked than didn't.  The set up of hell and the way suffering is used both as currency and to judge progress towards redemption is clever and interesting. Rintaro is not an admirable lead, but at this point he shouldn't be or there's nothing to redeem. Koyori is naive but likable, and carries the reader's sympathies. There are a few intriguing dramatic and even romantic undertones hiding beneath all the the in-your-face humor.The cover of Love in Hell and my description above should give ample warning of what you're in for here. If it doesn't seem like something you will like, you're almost certainly right. But I enjoyed this, absurdity and all. The premise and story have a lot of potential going forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3ODHN60E3R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937867897#wasThisHelpful","RV3ODHN60E3R4","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade collects the complete Black Summer series (issues #0-7).One of the legendary heroes known as the Seven Guns decides to take drastic action and fix corruption and lack of accountability in America via a merciless slaughter of those in power. With the nation now under his explicit orders to fix things or else,  John Horus' former teammates must decide what, if anything, they intend to do about the situation.Black Summer is another harsh, extremely graphic story from Warren Ellis. While Ellis can often be all over the place when he's ""on"" his work is amazing. The idea here is fantastic and filled with thought provoking themes and philosophies. The main characters are instantly compelling and provide a strong anchor for the story.Unfortunately while tightly plotted to start, it loses a ton of momentum and really slows down in the middle. Things eventually come to a fitting (if somewhat predictable) conclusion.The art's hit or miss throughout, with the violence often being too graphically detailed and becoming muddled. The style is quite striking though and it gets the point across.There's more to the premise, themes, and even the characters than Ellis achieves in Black Summer, but what's here is still a very good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WI8OELOFGVZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592910521#wasThisHelpful","R1WI8OELOFGVZW","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The anime made a couple changes that added intensity to the story and took full advantage of music, visuals, etc to make the slower parts more compelling.But the core of the story is the same and despite those minor criticisms, this really is a great read overall.

"Yosuke's family have guarded a treasure called the mermaid's egg for generations under the belief that in return for this service the mermaids of the ocean grant their village bountiful fishing and calm the sea. But as the sixty year period of protecting the current egg winds down Yosuke's beliefs face the challenge of progress. Would the village be better off capitalizing on its legends to attract rich developers and modern amenities as his father plans?As a big fan of Satoshi Kon's movies I was intrigued to check out one of his early works in a different medium. Tropic of the Sea is a solid story complete in one volume. It features classic themes of progress vs tradition, with a mythic aspect that is well integrated and executed.While the deliberate pace suited the tone and atmosphere, I found it uneven and a tad too slow in parts. The central conflict was a bit of a missed opportunity. Kon plays favorites here, with a couple key characters severely one-dimensional and selfish almost to the point of caricature. The setup had valid points to be made on both sides, and playing them evenly would've made the resolution more powerful.Those minor points keep Tropic of the Sea from reaching its full potential, but it's still a great manga. Yosuke's a strong lead and the excellent world building and core plot here make this well worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGLFA7TCN8YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939130069#wasThisHelpful","R3GGLFA7TCN8YS","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the New World is a layered story building of events all the way back to the first volume. No point starting with the finale - read from the beginning.The building, gruesome war and the dark secrets of Kamisu 66 Acreage come to a boil in an amazing conclusion. I had figured out one of the big twists ahead of time, but I was pleasantly surprised at the number of unexpected twists and reveals still packed into this final volume. The plotting and layering of From the New World has been exquisite, from the moral dilemmas and difficult choices the characters faced to the superb move and counter-move nature of the battles and conflicts waged. Important points are explained fully without slowdown, and the foreshadowing is perfectly balanced to provide context and impact to reveals without giving things away too early. This became a fantastic, wild ride once it got going and never let up through  the end.While the dark premise, level of violence, and often tacked on fanservice will be a deterrent for a number of readers, From the New World is a phenomenal read overall. It contains a lot of interesting philosophical questions framed by an incredible plot and maintains an unbelievable level of tension and intrigue. I'm sorry there isn't more, but what a finish.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUBYMM4A7AWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941220533#wasThisHelpful","R1TUBYMM4A7AWN","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This trade contains Detective Comics issues #621-626.Paul Dini, renown for his work on Batman: The Animated Series, brought his take on the character into the DCU ""proper"" with his work on one of Batman's flagship titles, starting with these six issues. While a bit hit or miss his stories made for good reads more often than not and presented interesting variations on established mythos as well as adding to it.The issues here are all stand alone stories. The first highlights Dini's approach - in the spirit of the book's title Dini sought to emphasize Batman's detective work and deductive reasoning. A decent mystery with a logical solution and some nice red herrings. Even being a bit rushed I liked having an interesting story in a single issue.The rest focus on well known members of Batman's rogues' gallery. The Poison Ivy story (823) was better in idea than execution, Penguin's (824) was good) and Dr. Phosphorus' (824) was kind of bland.My favorites were the second and last. In 822 we get a (mostly) reformed Riddler trying his had at private detective and cooperating/competing with Batman to solve another good mystery.And to close out the trade Robin gets blindsided into a confrontation with the most iconic of Batman's foes. There's a dangerous edge to the story and a lot of tension. Tim Drake is a favorite of mine so it was gripping watch him struggle so far out of his depth.Overall a great collection. Even the stories that didn't quite work as well as I'd like generally had interesting ideas. Strong start for Dini.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB6ZWNV3HI58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401212395#wasThisHelpful","R1DB6ZWNV3HI58","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade contains the first 107 strips of the webcomic Spacetrawler.*Note: I am reviewing the collected comics, not the print version of them.*Starship captain and galactic activist Nogg is left without a crew to help him liberate the meek yet technologically gifted Eebs from their galaxy-wide enslavement. His less-than-brilliant solution: get humans involved.One of Baldwin's other comics, Little Dee, is an all-time favorite of mine. So I was interested to see what he could do in an extremely different genre and format. To be honest my initial impression wasn't great. The early, ""scene setting"" strips didn't click well for me and I had a hard time getting into the comic. Thankfully I continued on the advice of someone who'd read farther, as somewhere in the 20's Spacetrawler picks up and never looks back.The crew is a diverse, well defined collection of nut cases and the dry (and often morbid) humor really works once the comic gets going. The core plot is a solid framework to move things along and Baldwin has a nice touch when it comes to surprises and twists. The balance of the character's personalities, both individually and as a group, is phenomenal. No one feels redundant or like a cipher, and while all too weird and idiosyncratic to be truly likable it's easy to become fond of most of them despite themselves.After an uneven start Spacetrawler becomes a fun, humorous adventure well worth traveling along with. I haven't read anything quite like it, including Baldwin's other comics.

"This book builds heavily off of past storylines and exclusively features previously introduces characters. At least book 3 and 4 must be read first, though it's best to start at the beginning.Here we go. The past that has haunted Konoha throughout the series comes to light in an incredible roller coaster ride of emotion and angst. Torn between the friends of today he finally made and the tragic events of yesterday, Konoha will have a lot of hard truths to face about himself and others.It would be a disservice to this book and the ones before it to get into any real details. Book Girl and the Wayfarer's Lamentation is an absolute masterpiece. Extremely hard to read in parts because of the raw emotion our leads are dealing with, but more than worth the effort. Everything from the way the chosen literary parallel is used to the resolution of several long running plot threads is pitch perfect and has tremendous impact. I hated certain characters, cheered for others, and wanted to shake sense into some so much at certain points I felt like screaming.In a lot of ways this seems like the culmination of the series, but a chilling closing line reminds us that there are more mysteries to explore before the end.I can't praise this series enough.

"While this volume begins the second half of the manga with some new directions, overall Monster is a careful constructed thriller that has been building from the beginning. This would be a mediocre jumping on point at best - read from the beginning.In the aftermath of Schuwald's donation ceremony, new information is available to several key characters, but it's a newcomer named Grimmer who takes center stage. A former spy and current journalist, he's researching the mysterious 511 Kinderheim orphanage and the horrific experiments that took place there.Despite a shift in focus the second half of Monster is off to a great start and retains the suspense and mystery the series is known for. Grimmer is a great, unique addition to the cast, and what he finds isn't quite what he, nor the reader, expects.

Instead he embraces a tarnished alter ego and sets out on a quest that will require a steady stream of compromised ideals. But he won't give up, because he's the only one who doesn't believe Bruce Wayne is dead.Time Drake has always been a favorite of mine and he really got a chance to shine given a new direction in this solo series.

It helps to have some prior knowledge of the Bat-universe and the happenings at the time this series started, but Yost does a good job of filling in enough to keep new readers from being too lost.Overall a fantastic start for Tim's solo adventures that I'm enjoying just as much on subsequent reads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDMG6YWG47D9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401226191#wasThisHelpful","RDMG6YWG47D9O","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade collects issues 21-28 of The Sandman.Sandman has been an interesting read for me. It has all been high quality, but the horror elements are often too much for me and there have been parts I just didn't care for. Yet the core characters and concepts are fascinating and the subtler stories have blown me away. I'd heard Season of Mists proclaimed one of the (if not THE) best stories in Gaiman's entire run, so was very curious going into this trade. It didn't disappoint.Morpheus made a mistake, long ago. Being called on it by the being he respects most, he sets off to the realm of an old foe to make amends.Season of Mists is an exquisite, volume long character driven story that weaves numerous mythologies together with an underlying theme of responsibility and consequences. Morpheus' first encounter with Lucifer was my favorite story from Preludes and Nocturnes, and while the follow up was nothing I expected it was incredible in its own right. The tale unfolds naturally and gives due time and consideration to the numerous characters it balances. Learning more about the other Endless is a particularly great treat. Numerous conflicting agendas and maneuvers build tremendous intrigue and tension leading to a compelling conclusion that opens as many plot threads as it closes.As much as I adored this volume of Sandman, it will likely be my last. I've reached the end of the volumes I purchased to try the series out, and the general tone and more horrific elements have me not at all in a rush to get more. You never know, but I'm finding this masterpiece to be a fitting stopping point for me rather than an enticement to continue.Still, the Sandman series is every bit as deserving of its awards and accolades as advertised and is worth at least a look for any comic fan. Horror and folklore fanatics will likely devour the entire series with glee. Season of Mists, both on its own and as part of the larger narrative, is simply phenomenal.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104Y6XEVMMHSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401230423#wasThisHelpful","R104Y6XEVMMHSR","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade collects Incredible Hulk issues #383-389 and Annual #17.Bruce Banner is at piece with the Hulks for the first time in his life and is in position to do some good aiding the autonomous Pantheon organization. But the drastic change to his status quo is making things difficult on the home front, and trouble never leaves Hulk alone for long.This volume is a total mixed bag as Peter David tries to proceed with Hulk's new direction while simultaneously being dragged into big crossover stories and tackling controversial social issues. Some of it works better than other parts.Issues #383-385 tie into the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries. The first finds the Pantheon sending Hulk after an old foe, while also providing some background for those not reading IG so that the following issues have some context. #384 continues the Abomination story with David using the IG tie in to put some interesting constraints on the story. The final crossover issue is less successful, having an interesting core concept but not really coming across well in execution.Next is a two issue story about a prophecy identifying a child destined to become the next Hitler. This was well done, posing ethical dilemmas with no good answer to let us see what the characters are made of. A couple of solid twists elevate this one and we get a lot of hints and foreshadowing about several aspects of the Pantheon.We proceed to Parts of Annual #17, with a quick yet heavy story about one of the guards on the testing site the day Banner became the Hulk and Part 2 of the Subterranean Wars crossover that was going through several annuals. The one page (each) prose summaries explaining what happened before and after this part were slightly more confusing than helpful, but David did a good job making this a complete story in its own right and highly emphasized the Hulk-related characters and relationships. Unnecessary but decent.We finish up with two single issues tales. The first deals with societal prejudice regarding AIDS and like the ""Hitler child"" issues is (intentionally) quite uncomfortable at times but is very well done. The last, featuring the Man-Thing, is the only issue not written by Peter David and honestly isn't on par with the rest of the trade.As a collection Volume 7 isn't particularly cohesive and has pacing issues likely related to the crossovers and issue/page constraints, but there's always something to think about in these stories and the high points are quite memorable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIKVZ2WW6NVHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785144579#wasThisHelpful","RIKVZ2WW6NVHY","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade contains Aphrodite IX (vol. 2) issues 6-11 and Aphrodite IX: Hidden Files.Volume 1 of Aphrodite IX: Rebirth took the core concepts and characters of a semi-decent, fan service heavy, action-fluff series from the late 90s and turned into a compelling, layered story of identity and survival amidst warfare in a fascinating post-aocalyptic world.This second collections builds well off that strong start and escalates both the stakes and Aphrodite's understanding of the world and her intended purpose in it. The war between the Gen and the Speros continues, but forces outside of both dominant cities have plans of their own. There's a ridiculous amount happening in these six issues but it all unfolds logically and with enough framework to follow, while still managing several organic twists and surprises. There is also good effort made to tie this incarnation back to the original Aphrodite IX mini-series (providing just enough context and explanation that anyone who hasn't read it won't be lost).Sejic has tweaked his painted art style a bit in these issues but it is just as impressive, detailed, and atmospheric.Hidden Files is a collection of supplementary material with more about Aphrodite IX and her world. There's a timeline and character biographies that both provide a lot of detail that helps flesh out and solidify the background of Hawkins' tale. There's also a fantastic section entitled ""Science Class"" where Hawkins shares research related to the comic and the scientific background used/adapted, and a cover gallery (including variants) to close the trade.This appears to be the end of the Aphrodite IX solo for now, with the next advertised trade/series to be Aphrodite IX/Cyberforce. While I'd prefer a little more time spent on Aphrodite's personal story (in fact a couple more issues wouldn't have hurt this trade), connecting the larger Top Cow Universe also has potential and I'm interested to see where Hawkins takes things from here.Overall more incredible work from Hawkins and Sejic. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABKUGOH3HY9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160706958X#wasThisHelpful","R3ABKUGOH3HY9U","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One hundred designers, authors and publishers in the tabletop gaming field were asked to list their top 3 or so games and then write an essay describing their top pick (or a lower choice if someone else had already claimed that one). So the book could have been quite different if different people were chosen, or even if the chosen participants had different priority regarding their entry. It gives the list an interesting make up and suits the goal of making everything positive instead of inciting arguments about inclusions or rank, but didn't lead to the general diversity one might hope. The collection is rpg heavy, allowing some esoteric gems to appear for that genre but really only the expected ""big names"" for the remainder of the field (Eurogames, card games, miniature games, etc). As a gamer who favors all of the latter, while this slant was understandable it none the less knocked the book down a notch for me.I've read these essays slowly a few at a time over several years. I still found myself doing a lot of skimming. The essays are competently written and I like getting an inside view on what designers like and are inspired by, but the majority of most essays is spent explaining gameplay in detail. For experienced gamers (like myself) it was usually more than needed to get the gist of the game and greater discussion of intangibles and what made the game fun/loved would have been preferable. For newcomers it is probably too much information. Either way I think these could have been written to be more engaging and useful.All that said this isn't a bad list by any means and there are some stand out entries. It's also clearly produced by contributors who love gaming and are excited about sharing that with others. Knowing going in that this is a book by professionals explaining the mechanisms of their favorite games and taking a look at the table of contents listing the games included should be enough to decide if it's worth your time/effort.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CT1Z1PZBGXLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932442960#wasThisHelpful","R1CT1Z1PZBGXLB","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trade collects the complete Point Blank miniseries (#1-5). It is a prequel to the comic Sleeper and adds insight to that story, but neither comic is necessary to enjoy the other.Cole Cash, once the deadly operative know as Grifter, is out of his depth after agreeing to help an old ""friend"" clean up some loose ends, no questions asked. But asking questions is exactly where Cole ends up when things start going wrong and he's forced to play detective with the precious little information that's been shared.I've heard a lot of good things about Sleeper and have always been a fan of Grifter so was pretty intrigued going into this. Point Blank is a great little mind bender of a story with strong layers of mystery and subterfuge throughout. Cole is a perfect lead for this. He's believable as someone thrust into a situation he's not used to without being stupid or ineffective. Part of the fun here is piecing things together as they go, so I'll avoid further plot details. I have some mixed feelings about the end, but it did fit logically and completed the story being told while providing set up for Sleeper.Overall I really enjoyed Point Blank and am looking forward to checking out its sequel series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R279063YKMPI0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401201164#wasThisHelpful","R279063YKMPI0S","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've a big fan of Green's novel, but this short story collection is a real mixed bag. In general the ideas are better than the execution. There are some gems though and Green's comments after each story are great accompaniments. Worth checking out almost more for what Green was trying to do with each than what he accomplished.Brief thoughts story by story:Question of Solace - Good once it got going, but Green's love of excessive run-on sentences and tangential descriptions drags this down more than usual. I also feel like I'd like this a lot more if I'd read the associated series.Street Wizard - Cute little story concept, but not much happens. I know it was by design, but I was left wanting more.Death is a Lady - Very short story, but interesting and atmospheric. Based on the author's own near-death experience.Dorothy Dreams - I liked this. Thoughtful Wizard of Oz variation.Down and Out in Deadtown - What's left when you've lost everything? An interesting, philosophical zombie story.From Out of the Sun, Endlessly Singing - Strange but compelling story of alien ""contact.""It's All About the Rendering - Weird story about a house straddling reality and what's beyond as neutral ground. Fine for what it was but wish there was more to it. The concept and characters could've been taking much farther.Find Heaven and Hell in the Smallest Things - Strong character driven sci-fi story about humans who have become something less forced to work towards Earth's expansion.Jesus and Satan Go Jogging in the Desert - I had no idea what to expect here, but it turned out to be my favorite story of the bunch.Food of the Gods - Twisted and disturbing, but well told.He Said, Laughing - Fascinating look at war and dark human nature, but the story itself feels unfinished.Soldier, Soldier - Dark, cynical but plausible look at using war solely to advance other interests.Manslayer - Nothing terribly original, but a great little sword and sorcery tale about facing a great evil regardless.Cascade - Ok twist on a classic mythological creature.Soulhunter - Several interesting concepts but I didn't care for this one.Awake, Awake Ye Northern Winds - Great pirate story with supernatural overtones.In the Labyrinth - Prequel to the previous. Fine but not nearly as good as its predecessor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O316A0Z0FGC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMTS53O#wasThisHelpful","R3O316A0Z0FGC2","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the New World is a layered story building of events all the way back to the first volume. Don't start here - read from the beginning.Saki and company flee to the devastated remains of a once great city in search of a last ditch defense against the invading army and its fiend. Unfortunately there are some who think their allies might be more dangerous than facing their greatest weakness...Everything's coming together nicely in this penultimate volume. Long running themes and questions continue to have great impact and relevance, pushing and testing the characters in horrific ways. I have a pretty good idea what awaits next volume, but the series has surprised me numerous times before. Either way it should be a wild ride to the end. The style and atmosphere is as always - great art, brutal violence, excessive fanservice, and incredible tension.Overall volume 6 is a strong ramp up to From the New World's end next volume.

"In a land of magic and strange creatures of all types a mysterious minstrel know only as Black Bard travels in search of any remnants of the ancient Crimson Empire.This was a fun manga. It has hints of King of Bandit Jing and Kino's Journey, two of my favorites, while putting its own spin on things. The art is excellent and stylistic, complimenting the story well. I enjoyed the first half of wandering adventures a tad better than the overarching story that emerged in the second half. The end was somewhat rushed, but all the important threads were wrapped up and it is nice to have the entire story complete and collected in a single volume.While it could have benefitted from being longer, Black Bard still manages an thoroughly entertaining ride alongside a charismatic lead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8XB6TI4LKTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935548387#wasThisHelpful","RL8XB6TI4LKTX","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The stories in each volume of Book Girl are relatively self-contained, but this book really builds off of previously established characters and plot lines. At least read book 3 first, better yet to start at the beginning.With Tohko's college exams on the horizon, Konoha is left strangely devoid of literary club activities and somehow ends up helping the music teacher alongside Kotobuki after school. Then one of Kotobuki's friends goes missing...As always summarizing the premise of a literature eating goblin in school form and her trusted club mate embarking on adventures that parallel great literary works makes Book Girl sound like a much lighter series than it is. The events, themes and tone of these books are incredibly dark and troubling. Heavy and tragic subjects are the norm here, not the exception, and The Corrupted Angel continues the upward trend in intensity.Kotobuki is a wonderful supporting character, and it was great to see her featured in a story that wasn't just fantastic and gripping in its own right, but also tied to numerous established plot threads, explored several relationships between established characters, and added amazing depth to Konoha's personal backstory.The framework literary story here is established immediately as Phantom of the Opera, and it's used perfectly to enhance both the story and suspense as things unfold. It's starts more subtly creepy than previous books which just serves to increase the tension and eventual impact as things get worse. The parallel storytelling here is just phenomenal. This book had me guessing all the way to the end, and then threw in some more mind-blowing revelations in the epilogue for good measure.It's the little touches and the fact that compelling, flawed characters are firmly at the center of every book that makes this series so impressive. I also like that it's progresses forward in time. The looming separation of Tohko's graduation adds an interesting complication to everything.I'll refrain from further detail to avoid spoilers, but I can't recommend this series highly enough. Book Girl and the Corrupted Angel is yet another intricate, compelling psychological thriller with tons of layers and an incredible atmosphere of tension and emotion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NA6VZSV7T4E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316076945#wasThisHelpful","R2NA6VZSV7T4E7","A2OIGPPBTR65MR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OIGPPBTR65MR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I laughed so hard in this book and yes most of it was of Gertie.  It is full of drama, laughter, mystery,murder.  I want more of Miss Fortune adventures..

"4 starsThis is a fairy tale. Comes with a Castle, princes, witches, magic good and bad. Also has plenty of drama, quests, romance and a clean read.  There is violence, and death and choices to make. The first part is a slow descriptions build up. I was not sure where the book would be heading. While I waited to see how it would all come out.  Some good characters, most of them I liked how they were changing and evolving. Lots of surprises along the way.Conrad was the oldest son of the King. Blond hair.  He will be King someday.Heppson is younger half brother to Conrad.  His mother is a witch.  She has bespelled the King.  His mother gave him a knife and told him to kill his brother.Moiria is older half sister to Heppson. Her mother makes her do things.  She stays in the background watching.Heppson knows he can't fight his mother's power.  He goes to Conrad and tells him what he is commanded to do.  He hopes Conrad will come up with a plan.  Heppson choses to run away and into the desert.I really liked the last half of the book best.  Lots more action, dialog and characters that pop along the way that are half human and half animal.

"This is book 5 of the Janitors series and final book.  I have read only 2 of the books and would suggest you read them in order would be best.  So you wouldn't know who were the heroes or who were the villains.  Since all the answers are revealed in this book.Janitors are the good guys. Cleaning tools are weapons and tools.  Depends on who or what changed them. There are rebels who are fighting the sinister Bureau of Educational Maintenance.The schools are battlefields.  They are making kids not want to learn, daydreams trying to ruin education.Another setting is a garbage dump.  A big one.  With garbage monsters that talk trash.This series is creative, the heroes are not what you expect them to be.  People keep surprising you for good or bad.Spit can be a good tool.There are monsters, witches, sweepers and kids with half monsters.  It is a exciting series with surprises around the corners.It is a clean read or dirty one.  That is filth as in mud, trash and glop.  It is a fun book to read.Someday I would like the time to read all 5 books in a row in this series.

"Good suspense. Plenty of drama, action, love scenes with characters that are interesting.  This is the 5th book of the Covert Cowboys, Inc but my first I have read in this series.Angus Ketchum was a ex-soldier.  He was wounded and has some self image issues.  He has been hired as a body guard, cowboy. Though Reggie doesn't know it. He grew up on a ranch in Texas.  Angus has a dog called Ranger.Reggie Davis is a widow.  She is independent.  Reggie is working the ranch and determined that her 5 year  old Tad will inherit the ranch.I like Tad. He is a cute kid who loves to play with dogs.There are attacks on Reggie and things are going wrong on the ranch.  At first seams like accidents but someone thinks Reggie is in danger.  When Angus appears on the ranch things start to escalate in danger.I think Reggie and Angus turn into each other awfully fast considering where they are in life.  But the whole story happens in a real short time frame.The setting is Fool's Fortune, Colorado.  On a ranch in the mountains.Overall I enjoyed reading High Country Hideout.  I would like to read more books in the Covert Cowboys, Inc.

"This is a short book with a big message that really hit the spot for me today.  It has brief messages with quotes, scriptures and stories that go with the 5 points, rules or guidelines to help you live better.There are beautiful photos that take you to peaceful, quiet places.  I feel calm and wonder at looking at them.The first point is Tilt Your Sout.  How important that the tilt of a airplanes wing are for deciding if the plane goes up or down.  That it matters for us to were we look.  Suggests we take time to pray first of the day and end.These points I have heard many times but sometimes I don't pay attention or slack off and I need to be reminded.

"I've never had a hammock before and was excited to get one. I wanted one for our outings, first thinking of camping, then my mind wandered to all the times we go to the park or the beach to hang out and BBQ. There are so many outings this would have come in handy.I was expecting this elaborate big hammock and was pleased to see just how compact it is. It's all folded up in this very manageable bundle. As a matter of fact, the pouch that is is kept in is attached to the hammock material, so that's even more convenient. This kit includes the straps and metal rings that you need to put it up. It's so simple to put up.The material is super thin so I was worried about it's durability but it actually is very tough. I like that you can put it back easily too. It folds up just as easily as unfolding and you can stuff it back into it's pouch for storage. It takes up very little room.Nevermind camping, I wanna take this to our next beach BBQ. We like to set up a little picnic area in the tree line instead of being out in the sun and this will be perfect.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5K07TDKFRLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8B49W2#wasThisHelpful","R3R5K07TDKFRLJ","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this bluetooth shower speaker for about a week and really like it. The big selling points for me was the fact that it suctions to the shower wall and the FM radio. The suction works out great but I am less the FM radio leaves me wanting.I tried out this product without grand expectations for blowout sound quality. I do expect however for it to live up to it's product decription. With the exception of the FM radio, I do believe it does.I put it to work right away and am really glad that I have this in my shower. I have other speakers that are water resistent also but they aren't made for the shower, so I have to set them just outside the shower and the sound is muffled. With this shower speaker, it goes directly on the wall of the shower and you get a nice loud sound. Now, you are not getting some super high tech stereo quality sound, but my music is loud and clear. The shower amplifies the sound even more. Even with the water running, it doesn't take away from that.I have tile walls in my shower and the suction cup has held up nicely. I haven't had it fall on me once.I was excited to see that it has FM radio because sometimes you just wanna play music when you are already in the shower and forgot to activate the bluetooth on your phone and get some music going. There is no display, so you don't know what station you are on. There is a scan function but that is not good.....it only scans to static and lesser known stations. Now, I have hit the arrow buttons to the left and right and manually moved through the stations until I found the one with music I like. The station comes through clear once I do though. When I turn it off and back on, then press the FM button my station does stay there and I don't dare hit scan again because I'm scared I will lose the station again.The water resistant function of this product is great. This is not fully waterproof though. It can survive a splash or even water sprayed onto it by the shower head but do not immerse this in water.So, bottom line is I do really like this shower speaker, but not a fan of the process to find an FM station.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D56X5Z0MSRVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHV6TIE#wasThisHelpful","R1D56X5Z0MSRVM","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great dry bags. Most other companies sell them in 10L, which I have one already. This set is fantastic because you get a huge 20L and a little 5L dry bag.Basically a dry bag is made of this rubbery PVC Tarpaulin material which when you roll the top down over itself several times, creates a water tight seal, keeping your belongings safe from water leaks. It's really the combination of that tight seal and the air caught inside the bag that helps make that tight seal together.Throw your items in the bag. Don't flatten the bag...let the air remain and start rolling down the top in tight rolls. Over and over until you can't roll it anymore. On either end of the roll is a buckle. Turn the sides up to the point where you can buckle the two sides together. You should have a nice tight seal.The size selection sets this apart from others I've tried. The larger one also has a 5 x 7 clear window to look in to see your items and a valve to help decompress air from for storage. it comes with a shoulder strap for easy carrying.I have used dry bags in the ocean, carrying my items with me as the bag floated on the top of the water along with me. This way I didn't have to fear leaving my important stuff back at the towels and stuff at the beach. Dry bags work great for me and I swear by them. When you do get them wet, the top may get wet and a drop or two of water might go inside the bag as you open it. While tightly closed, no water comes in. Let them dry all the way out before storing and rinse any salt water off as soon as you can.I gave this set a test in the bathtub and shower and they both worked great. I can't wait for our next beach trip.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WKKWLM1J3JGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWJ6A3K#wasThisHelpful","R2WKKWLM1J3JGP","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a cute bag for the comic book nerd in all of us. I wasn't really into comics growing up, but with movie after movie coming out and my teenage son being a fan of comics, I've grown to love them too.This tote is Marvel trademarked. The super heroes are pictured on the front with I ONLY DATE SUPER HEROES written on it. This kind of funny is right up my alley and I use it proudly.  Obviously I love the design but the quality of the bag and stitching are high quality as well. It's a typical tote size which is great for me to bring to work or even to the gym.

"I've been using these Brainwavz in-ear monitors aka earphones for a couple weeks and am really liking the sound they produce. They have a sleek design and are well made.Out of the package I received:earphoneshard caseshirt clips/m/l sets of silicone tipsbi-flange and tri-flange silicone tipsfoam tipsinstructionsBrainwavz has gone above and beyond to provide not only a very nice working pair of earphones but all the tips you could need to get the perfect feel and size for you. The case is also very cool with it's red and black design. The case has mesh compartments on each side so you can store your extra tips in.I will start off by saying I like everything about these earphones. I've been listening to a variety of music, TV shows and even text to voice and they have not let me down. I am not a professional but I do like the way they make my music sound. While not noies cancelling, they do cut out a lot of outside noise. If someone speaks to me while they are in, I have to pause my music and take out one to hear what is being said to me. Even while no music is playing, they block out a lot of outside noise.I really like the sleek red and black design. The cord is flat which doesn't tangle as easily as round cords and it just looks cooler. The housing is a sturdy metal. I like the way they clack together while I'm handling the earphones.After trying all the tips, I have decided that the tri-flange tips are my go-to favorite. They just fit my small ears so nicely. I am really intrigued by the foam tips because I've never had those come with a pair of earbuds before, but I found them difficult to remove to change out without fear of damaging them and your ear wax gets stuck in the pores of the foam.Bottom line, they look cool and sound cool. I had no hints at all of crackling or muffled sound. The sound was crisp and clear, hitting hard with the bass tones but not overwhelmingly so.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMWN346HGOTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PACTGXA#wasThisHelpful","R1GMWN346HGOTP","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting this pillowcase, I really didn't have much expectation. I wanted a pillow case for my daughter's body pillow. I was happy to find that this pillowcase is so very soft. It is white and has almost a sheen to it and feels cool to the touch when you move. I love when you move and have a nice cool section.There isn't much to add. It's a body pillow case that is amazingly soft and fits great. It has high praise in the reviews and for good reason.

"I've tried a different type of travel pillow before; the type with the little bean bag filler balls inside. I really do like that style but was interested when I saw that this travel pillow has memory foam with cooling gel.This pillow is amazing. When I first opened the package, I was surprised at how heavy the pillow was. It arrived in it's cloth carrying case. Once you pop it out of the case it expands quite a bit. It has a sturdy form that is shaped to fit around your neck perfectly. The material is cotton and polyester with a valour feel.Even though you'd expect a valour pillow to be warm and overheat you with regular use, it's memory foam inside with cooling gel keeps you cool. I don't fully understand how that works but it's awesome. You get that cozy feel but it still feels nice.There is a clasp in the front to help keep it secure. It is curved, so your head rests naturally on it. I have issues with feeling trapped or sufficated in certain situations and I can use this without any problems.I am going on a road trip next month in Sept and can't wait to bring this along.

"This solar powered light is so simple to set up and use. You can set it up and use right away when you get it. When I took the items out of the box, I had the light that has LED lights along the bottom and solar panel along the top. The light comes with 3M sticky pads and screws so you can mount it with your choice. It also has instructions and a small pin tool.When looking at the light, there are no buttons to press or compartments that open. It is a fairly simple design with an indention to hang it with a screw on the back. At the front, there is a small hole, with icon indicating that that is the power control. This is where that small pin tool comes in. To turn it on, you simply take that little tool and press into the hole. It is now on. The high / low light adjustments will happen automatically and you don't have any more control of it.When it gets dark, it will emit a low light, and with the LED, that is still pretty bright. Once it detects motion, it will emit a bright light with the LED lights. During the day, the light will charge automatically for you. This light is so drama free. You literally turn it on, hang it up and don't have to mess with it again.I played around with different places to put it, finally settling on the front of my house by our front door. There is a solar light further out in the yard, but with this being right by the front door, it will light up while we are trying to get our key into the door.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCCGNW9SPAFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DFYFW#wasThisHelpful","R3JCCGNW9SPAFB","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start off by saying that I am not a germophobe and I'm not scared to touch a soap container for fear of germs, so I need it to be hands-free. I do, however appreciate convenience and this soap dispenser provides me just that.This motion sensor soap dispenser by Ohuhu has a great look and works great. It has a nice chrome finish to it and looks great along my sink; much better than a store bought soap dispenser. You can put whatever you'd like in it. I debated using this for a dish soap dispenser but decided to use it for hand soap.It's powered by 4 AA batteries that are not included. In the packaging you will find a key. That is what you use to afix the bottom to it. Add the batteries and put on the black bottom. Use the key to lock it. Find somewhere safe for the key where you won't lose it.To add soap, you just push the top off and unscrew the top of the soap storage. Fill it up and close the top. You are now good to go. It has a motion sensor, so you just place your hand underneath and it will drop a little bit of soap.We originally put it in my kids bathroom but I kept going in there to find soap dispensed all over the bottom piece and all around it. We then moved it to the kitchen and have not had one incident. Upon further investigation, I discovered that our cat really likes the kids sink and it was his tail swishing back and forth that made the soap dispense. It's been in our kitchen for over a week now and it's working perfectly.We have been doing a lot of yard work this week and it's so convenient to just have it dispense a bit of soap in your hand and wash up. There is also a wall mount and hardware, but I have that put away because I like it on the sink counter.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25I50TAIJMZWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PY6ST2#wasThisHelpful","R25I50TAIJMZWN","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights are so tiny but very bright. The battery pack is also small, so it they can be easily be incorporated in a decorate center piece or even a funky outfit.My mind is racing with all the possibilities and I'm thinking that I want to incorporate them into a costume for Halloween coming up. I saw a post for a jelly fish costume that uses an umbrella and lights. It has me excited.The lights are entwined into a bendable metal that you can wind around stuff. I also like the use of them with centerpieces and flowers. I will really only be using these for special occasions because the battery life is only 24 hours. Now, I did find a listing for a 10 pack of the batteries for only $6, so the replacement batteries are fairly cheap.I got to try out each of the 5 colors and they do not dissapoint. For being these tiny LED lights, they are super bright. They look adorable as decoration with the different colors, but again, I don't want to drain the batteries so I don't turn them on often.The batteries are fairly easy to install and the battery door snaps closed.

"These have so many uses, I wouldn't even really call them a scarf. As someone who lives in FL, I really don't wear scarves often. I do however wear cloth headbands and bandanas around my head to keep my hair under control with the FL humidity.When I saw this ""scarf set, it was different than any that I've tried and I was excited to try them out. You get a set of 3. It is a long tube of fabric that is seamless. The fabric is a super soft material, almost reminding me of a thinner version of those maxi dresses / skirts.  They have a silky sheer quality to them and are stretchy.Each one of this set has a different set of skull designs. The black / grey skull design is my favorite and I've worn it almost every day. One of them also has a design that you can put on like a mask from the nose down and it looks like the bottom part of a skull and the top part from the eyes up. These are clever ideas to wear over your face when riding a motorcycle to cover your nose and mouth from bugs.The way I've been wearing mine is mostly a headband style. I just scrunch it up or fold it up, depending on my mood and slide it over my head to function as a headband. When I wear my hair down, I'll allow more of the fabric out to act more like a headband. I like that I don't have to tie or buckle anything. It's so easy to put on and they stay put.This is the first time for me trying this style and I'm completely sold.  Love them!

"I tried out this bicycle pump on both our bicycle and a football. There was some trial and error on my part, but I think I got it down now.When I first saw that this has a bike mount, I thought that it would be so handy to have this with your bike at all times. Then I went out to our bicycles and realized that none of ours has a spot to mount anything to it's frame. Until we get new bikes, that feature really doesn't benefit us.I tried out the bicycle tire first. Even though there are pictures in the instructions, I still had some difficulties getting the little lever to go up and stay up. It was hard to push and wouldn't stay, especially when I was trying to maneuver between the spokes. What I ended up having to do is place it as firmly as I could onto the valve with the lever down, then try to keep it still while I pressed hard on the lever to get it upright and locked for it to stay. Once I was able to get it in that position, I was good to go. I could pump the hand pump easily and it pushed air into the tire. It did take quite a bit of pumping because it is so little.Then I tried it out on a super deflated football we had in the house. I used the same method for putting in the ball pin that was included. I inserted it all the way, then raised the lever to the point where it wouldn't come back down. I inserted into the ball and started pumping. It seemed like I was pumping forever and not much was happening. Upon further inspection, I realized that the hole was bigger than the pin and most of the air was coming back out instead of into the ball. I used my fingers to clamp around it to force the air into the ball and it was faster going after that.Bottom line, this does work, if you use it right. With this being so small, I really won't be using it to pump up the bikes before going out. I'll still use the big pump for that. However, it does work well for an emergency pump. I still really like the idea of having it attached to your bicycle while out. Even though I don't have holes to screw it to my frame, I think I will still try and fashion a way to put it on there.I received this product for a discounted rate or free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LK0HYI84BS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XW0R0K8#wasThisHelpful","R34LK0HYI84BS4","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this digital timer for a couple weeks now and have been using it regularly. It's so sleek and simple, yet works so very well.This desgin almost reminds me of an apple product with it's white minimalistic design. It's white and round  with only two icons on it, indicating where to press.To use, you just rotate the outside rim to the right and it will increase in 10 second intervals. You control the speed, so if you only want it set for a couple minutes you can go slower, and if you want it for longer, you can move it faster, slowing as you near the number you want.You start and stop with the triangle (play) icon and reset it with the square icon. It will only reset while it is stopped. I've been using it mostly for cooking and I've taken it outside with me while grilling to keep up with what is cooking inside the house. The beeping isn't super loud. You can hear it loudly if it's in the same room, but you won't if it's in another room. It will beep for 60 seconds and I like that as it's beeping, it will count up.....so you can see how long you are over your target time when you get to the timer to turn it off.The display is digital. It's large and easy to read. One interesting feature of this timer is there is no on/off button. At first, that had me concerned that it would drain the battery but this is such a simple design, it doesn't drain the battery like I'd thought. After all, I have watches with more going on and they've lasted me years. I have no worries with the battery going out.Last but not least, the magnet. This has come in handy because I can just put it on the hood over the stove while I cook and it's at eye level. The magnet is built into the back of the timer and it's pretty strong.I only have positive things to say about this timer.

"This is a really nice, high quality set of tools for blackheads.Now, I know the entire topic of pimples and blackheads is gross, but the fact is we get them and have to deal with them. In my teens, I struggled very bad with acne and became a picker, leaving scars in my face in places. I was never concerned that what I was doing to my face could scar and how that would effect me.Well, now my own children are teens and I am seeing them struggle with acne and even worse blackheads than I had experienced when I was younger. I have been trying to help them with proper hygiene and with whiteheads / blackheads. To them it's torture, but I feel they need it done with a gentle hand, so they won't end up with scars like I did.This kit is perfect for our needs. I'd bought a tool that was cheap and flimsy. Every piece in this kit is so much more sturdy and much higher quality. They are the caliber of tools that you will find in a professional's office. There are 7 tools that include one angled mirror and 6 double sided tools with various loops, slotted ends, round cutouts, etc. that you can use to help remove whiteheads / blackheads.I would recommend doing your research to make sure you are using them correctly. There is no instruction book or pamphlet that comes with this set. I am very careful that I am not damaging the skin in any way when I use them.I truly was not expecting such high quality tools when I ordered this kit and I am so happy with them.

"I have been using the See Me Here BV350 wireless bluetooth speaker for about a week and I am really impressed.I had tried other wireless speakers and this one is so durable and impressive in so many ways.Out of the package:Bluetooth speakerBicycle Mount w/ screwsInstructionsAudio cableMicro-USB charging cableCaribinerWe will definitely be getting a lot of use out of this speaker. It's very rugged in it's design. The outside has a rubberized feel to it, so less likely to be damaged if accidentally dropped or tossed around with your gear. It's black and dark green which resonates well with manly men. My hubby loves it.You can choices on how you play music through it.Connect to BluetoothUse male to male audio cable to connect to devicePlay directly from Micro SD cardIt is charged with a micro-USB charging cable that is included. A full battery can play up to 8 hours. There are indicator lights on the front to show the battery charge.Control the volume and play/pause functions with the button at the top. Press to play/pause and turn to control the volume. I should note that when you control the volume, it is specific to the speaker. Adjusting that does not make the adjustment on your phone itself.If using the Micro SD card, you have an up and down button along the front that you can use to go back and forth through the music on it.It was a breeze to connect to Bluetooth and I was surprised at how far the reach went. Not only how far, but how strong the signal was. I have tried other bluetooth products that work great for 30 meters in open spaces, but if the device and speaker are separated by a wall or large piece of furniture it will start to break up. This speaker is fantastic. I can walk into my master bathroom while the phone is still sitting on my kitchen table. That is two walls separating them and it sounded great.The sound quality is very clear and it can get very LOUD. The speakers completely surround it, so you get a nice all around sound. Now, when you turn it on or connect, there is a voice indicator. It sounds garbled to me and at first I didn't even know what it was saying. After using it for a while, I recognize when it is saying ""bluetooth mode"" and ""connected"". Turning it on and off you hear a little chime noise.We still plan to get new bicycles but I am excited that I will be able to mount this speaker when I do. It also includes a caribiner to hang on your backpack or bag. This speaker is also water resistent. It does say not to submerge it in water, so I am reluctant to call it waterproof. I have not put it to the waterproof test as of yet.I have only the greatest things to say about this bluetooth speaker. I see no downside at all.

"One of the constant gripes in our household is where the toenail clippers are. I keep a tiny pair of fingernail clippers for myself in my purse, but somehow my family can't seem to keep track of the toenail clippers. Obviously we have had several pairs over the years.I got this toenail clippers set not really expecting much but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the clippers. There is also a bonus case and emery board that comes with it.The size is very nice at 3 inches. You can really use them for either toenails or fingernails. They are stainless steel and very sturdy. That way you know they won't rust if exposed to water or even left in a pocket and accidentally washed. (happens quite often with us. Our 12 year old is on laundry duty and never checks pockets)What I found unique about this set of nail clippers is they have this groove for your thumb that really helps keep a good grip on it while using them. They make a solid cut and the blades are sharp. You don't need to apply very much pressure at all.I keep the clipper and the emery board in the little pouch provided and it has a permanent home in our bathroom, so when the family asks me where they are, I can answer with confidence.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBBJ9BVKXFA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMD3UUM#wasThisHelpful","R2QBBJ9BVKXFA7","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves this 18 pack of chalk markers.We've had other chalk markers in the past but they didn't have this color variety that this pack has.Chalk markers are so much fun because you can write on mirrors, windows and other non-porous surfaces. We even write our shopping list on our microwave with ours. I bought a sheet of chalkboard contact paper that my daughter likes to draw murals on. She loves that the colors in this pack allow her to create more things. There is a peach color that she is excited to use for skin color.Chalk markers are super easy to use.  Each one has the colored cap that identifies what color is inside. The tip comes dry and can be flipped around for you to choose whether you want to write with a rounded tip or a chisel tip. To activate, you press down on the tip to release the air inside, and give it a good shake. Now press again for a bit until the ink fills in the marker tip. It might take about a minute to completely fill in.Now you are good to go and write notes or decorate. You can celebrate with writing on car windows, write notes to each other on mirrors, or like us, write your shopping list on your microwave. We put our markers to use and love them. These markers provide a nice full vibrant color with their writing.It's super easy to clean up. After all, these go on wet but dry like chalk. You can use a damp cloth and it wipes right away.

"When I first got this, I thought it was cool but wasn't sure how often it would really get used, with the exception of the pen and stylus. I've surprised myself at how often having a screwdriver and level is handy to have in your purse. This little gadget 6 in 1 pen can do that and more.Pen: Writes in black in and writes nicely. Turn the tip to show / hide the writing tip.Stylus: Opposite end of the pen. In there very sturdy with good flexibility. Works great with my phone.Ruler: Built into the side of the pen. Shows up to four inches.Level:Also built into the side of the pen. Style is a hexagonal shape, so the pen lays flat and doesn't roll. Easy to read.Flathead screwdriver &Phillips screwdriver: Opposite the pen side, removable peice with flathead screwdriver tip on one side and phillips on the other. It's held in there by a rubber bumper. Stays secure when screwdriver is in use.Also note that when you unscrew the stylus to display the screwdriver, you don't have to lose the stylus tip. Just screw it onto the pen side. There is also a metal clip along the side of the pen to hang onto your shirt, notepad, etc.This gadget pen really does so many things and I've put to use a number of times since I've gotten it. It's so little and light, that it's easy to keep with you. I keep mine in my purse.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45KSDR7QVV3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3KIVVQ#wasThisHelpful","R45KSDR7QVV3C","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How adorable is this cat litter mat!?We have a one cat household and he makes his fair share of mess with loose litter around the box. We've even started using a high walled rubbermaid bin as his box, which does help with him tossing litter out. It doesn't get rid of the litter that gets stuck on his paws though.The Two Meows cat litter mat is working out great for us. We have it placed right outside his box, so the first couple steps he takes is on the mat. The litter gets trapped in the unique design of the mat. It looks like it should be really bristly but it's actually a super soft silicone rubbery material. The back is also rubbery so it doesn't slip or move around at all.To wash mine, I just take it under the sprayer in the shower and it rinses out very easily. Not only does it work really well, it is absolutely adorable. Love the paw shape!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCSNQR1HHNKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XM2HJXY#wasThisHelpful","R2QCSNQR1HHNKM","AZOEM76ARI9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZOEM76ARI9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great case for larger headphones, like Bluetooth sets. The case is soft, yet hard cover to properly protect your headphones. The inside of the case has a nice mesh pocket on both sides that can keep two sets of headphones or one set and a charging cable. The possibilities are up to you.

"The Paper Mate Profile pens are a long time favorite of mine. They may not be as fancy as the new Ink Joy line, but these are better quality pens. They are extremely smooth to write with and very comfortable to hold. If you need to do a lot of writing, these pens are a joy. I also love the variety of colors. They are not refillable, but are very long lasting. There is a lot of ink in these pens. Paper Mate should be advertising these instead of the cheaply made Ink Joy line.

"I tend to prefer on ear or over ear headphones, since they are easier to use and don't fall off. I was offered a free pair of these Bluedio headphones in exchange for an honest review, so I decided to give these a chance. The headphones arrive in a nice, full color box and are a bit heavier than expected. There is the headphones, my set also says Bluedio, flange tips and ear pieces, along with a charging cable and instructions. Please note that there is no carrying pouch, so you will need to purchase one. The flange tips were not installed and I had to put those on. They are the white tips that help them stay in your ears. I had a hard time changing the ear pieces, since they were small. The headset fits ok, for me it was not as comfortable, since I have more trouble with in ear pieces. Once I found the right fit the headset worked well. Pairing is easy. There is a too small LED pin light that flashes blue when turned on, pairs and stays on while charging. I personally would prefer a larger light that is easier to see, but it does work. Charging is fast and the set arrived 3/4 full. Sound quality is clear and good, but very light on bass. Music, videos and calls sound good and the set handles water well. This is a nice pair of headphones that look great and work well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FL07EBR6TNXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Y63BGM#wasThisHelpful","R2FL07EBR6TNXF","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am generally not a fan of in ear headsets. The QCY headphones have changed my mind. This is a fantastic, well made and high quality Bluetooth headphone set. They arrive in an elegant cardboard package, with two boxes inside; one for the headphones and one for the instructions, charging cable and ear tips. Please Note: the manual states that the set includes a drawstring carry bag. It Does Not. You will need to purchase a carrying case. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. My set arrived fully charged. The on off button is large and easy to see and use. Pairing is a breeze and the sound quality is excellent, better than several sets of Panasonic headphones I have. It is rich, full stereo sound for music, movies and call quality. I tend to use my phone for controlling play and not the headset. They handle water well and actually stayed in my ears. They last a full hour workout, battery life is great and charging is fast. If you are a fan of lightweight headphones, you may want to have several pairs. This is a really fantastic set of high quality headphones that work for a great price.Please note that I received a free pair in exchange for an honest review.

"I regularly take Co Q10 and was curious to try this formulation from Viva Labs. Like many supplement providers, Viva touts their formulation as advanced, pharmaceutical grade and easily absorbed. This bottle is 100MG of Co Q10 and includes Black Pepper fruit extract, extra virgin olive oil, gelatin, vegetable glycerin, purified water and beeswax. The capsules are small, dark colored oval shaped that are very small and easy to swallow. I've never seen dark capsules for Co10, they are normally light colored. Having taken these for several weeks, I can't say that I've noticed any difference. I normally take a 200MG higher dose cap from a direct manufacturer and Viva Labs version didn't really impress me. I didn't feel any noticeable difference. When I take my regular version, I will feel more energy. I didn't feel much of anything from the Viva Labs version. Good Co Q10 formulations should be fairly pure without fillers and additives. This isn't as pure and is not made by Viva Labs. Another company manufacturers it for them. It's just an ok product. There are much better versions out there. At least they give you 150 capsules in a bottle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127ASQEA11PL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES205Y#wasThisHelpful","R127ASQEA11PL7","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This set of earphones by Sooyo is a high quality set that is a great replacement or addition for the Apple earphones. They are packaged similarly and look and feel nearly identical. The Apple set has a thicker cable. The sound quality and ease of use of the Sooyo headphones is fantastic. Music sounds rich and full in stereo. Call quality is also great, I can hear callers well and they can hear me. Since Apple now charges $30 for replacement earphones, this is a great cost effective solution.

"I have been an Oral B brush user for many years. I was curious to try the Sonicare, since several friends have mentioned how much they love their Sonicare brushes. This is an advanced brush. It comes with a complete set of accessories; the brush handle, an AdaptiveClean brush head, an InterCare brush head for plaque removal, a travel charger with brush head storage, a deluxe travel case and two hygienic travel caps. The travel caps don't enclose the brush heads completely, so I suggest that you purchase some caps. A great one is made by Dr. Things. They are natural and biodegradable.  The brush handle is lightweight and fairly comfortable in the hand, although you do have to be careful not to hit the buttons while brushing. The handle has a nice round on/off button, three LED lights to show whether you are using Low, Medium or High intensity, with a rocker button to change that setting and three modes for cleaning. Clean is the standard and runs for about 2 1/2 minutes.  The White setting is for polishing your teeth, which lasts two minutes and my favorite, Deep Clean, which lasts three minutes. There is a battery shaped LED to show battery strength with three circles below it.If you are coming from an Oral B brush, it will take a bit of adjustment to get used to this brush. Oral B's run until you turn them off and tend to need more charging time. The brush head replacements are also cheaper and come in a variety of types, with the sensitive head a small round brush head. Oral B's brush heads also tend to reach the gum area more. Sonicare's brush heads are larger and don't impact the gum area as much. My gums would be a bit sore using Oral B's brush heads until I switched to the sensitive head. I had no problems with the Sonicare brush heads irritating my gums. It is quieter in operation and nearly lasts three weeks between charges. Because I use the deep clean mode, I tend to charge mine around two weeks. This is quite liberating, since I had to charge my Oral B twice a week since I brush a bit longer. My teeth feel really clean after brushing. I have to say that I was initially skeptical, but have come to really like the way this brush operates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGT6S4ESB7RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","RNGT6S4ESB7RO","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm generally not a big fan of portable chargers. While they are small and can be easily transported, most won't fully charge my iPhone or Kindle tablets. The closest I've come has been a uNu battery. I was given a sample in exchange for an unbiased review. That being said, this little battery is small, light, easy to hold and transport. It comes with a small, very short cable and a nice carry pouch. The battery only takes a few hours to charge, since it has no power button you have to rely on the lights. I tested this on my Kindle HDX 7"" starting at a 35% power level. The battery got it up to 55% in a couple hours before the red light kicked on. The battery was also very hot. I was not impressed. While it did charge faster, it didn't make much of a difference in total charging. Please note that if you want to use this for an iPhone, you will need a case with a micro USB port. The Aukey cable is not lightning compatible. I also tested it with my iPhone in a case with a micro USB port to roughly the same outcome. This is is an ok battery.

"I haven't been a big fan of new bulbs since many are so expensive and I was used to my 100 watt lamp and bulb. When it finally wore out and I had to purchase a new lamp, I was not looking forward to navigating the new bulb options. LEDs were not on my list. I was offered a free sample to test in exchange for an honest review. Despite that, I have no problems giving low marks to products that don't work well. Not so here! This LED comes beautifully packaged in a colorful box that gives you information on the wattage and light options.

"The AmazonBasics charging cable is a nicely made Apple compatible lighting product. It is similar in color and style to the original Apple cable, with the AmazonBasics logo on the lightning end. One of the best features is the very long 6 foot length of the cable. Apple's is great, but not long enough. I have a Belkin Apple certified charging cable I use most often, since it is a nice balance in length. The AmazonBasics cable is a bit too long, and you should be careful to keep it partially coiled to prevent tripping, if it close to the floor. While it charges well, it does not charge as quickly as the Apple original or the Belkin product. This is a great product if your ports are far apart and a great lower cost alternative.

"At last, a new collection of Bigfoot tales from the master, Rusty Wilson. Sit back, relax and be very glad you aren't anywhere near the boonies in Alaska! This is a great collection of stories of Bigfoot encounters set in the largest state. Bigfoot lovers know that while they are found in all U.S. states except Hawaii, the ones in Alaska tend to have a fierce reputation, more so than the ones in the lower 48. This collection will definitely keep you hooked. I read the book in one sitting, it was engrossing. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say, most of the folks whose wonderful tales are shared left Alaska. There are many tales where you will will say OMG, and have to reread a passage again. As always, the tales are told with love and respect and you may not want to read this at night with the lights off. The Alaskan Bigfoot Campfire Stories is the latest in the Bigfoot Campfire series. If you enjoy this book, and you will, check out the other books in the series. They are all equally fantastic, well written and much more interaction than someone who saw a figure on a highway, for better or worse. I have them all and they are all great even after multiple reads.  Must reads include, ""The Hairy Trio of Bigfoot Stories"" and the excellent, ""Ten Intense Bigfoot Campfire Stories."" They are all highly addictive. Don't forget to check out Rusty's blog and say hi, he loves to hear from fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DC61CKWRDAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014C3R9Q8#wasThisHelpful","R36DC61CKWRDAB","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the white set of Trainer headphones. These are beautiful looking headphones. I've received a number of compliments from friends and coworkers while wearing them. Getting them out of the box was a hassle. They look fantastic in the packaging, but whoever designed them should be fired. There were screws on the box that had to be removed before you could even separate the outer shell and you have to remove a number of times to remove the headphones. They are a slightly sung fit and if you wear glasses, you will have to adjust them. The top section's inside padding is minimal. Since these are over the ear, you will hear outside sound and others close by may hear what you are listening to. The foldout Aeroflex does hold the headphones still and they don't move around. It is really great to be able to workout without wires. I do treadmill and strength training and I am able to move freely. The sound is also incredible, rich, full sound whether I'm listening to music, audiobooks or a movie. The night light is a nice feature, though I rarely go out at night. The waterproof feature is excellent for workouts, since they do cool down. The removable ear cups cannot be washed in a washing machine, they must be brainwashed and air dried. I don't wear them for long periods, I'm not a runner, but I would say that they would become uncomfortable after a longer period. Call quality is great, I can hear callers and the can hear me with few problems. They pair easily with my iPhone. The controls on the headphones are way too small and not intuitive. You really have to study the quick start guide to figure out how to use them. It is also difficult to use the buttons while wearing the headphones. I use the controls on my iPhone, since it's easier. A nice white cloth carrying bag is included to carry them. The charging port is sealed and can be hard to open, since it is small. Charging the headset takes a few hours. A light will go out when charging is complete. Other than the ridiculous packaging, this is a good first effort. More padding, larger buttons and softer ear cups would really help. If you purchase direct from Gibson, they have a payment plan. The Gibson Trainer headphones are great for active workouts for shorter periods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OY51C33BKZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZ42HBI#wasThisHelpful","R32OY51C33BKZN","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wound up ordering these cloths by accident. I was looking for a Prime Day deal and wound up purchasing these. The MagicFiber cloths are individually packaged and work much better than I expected. I use them for cleaning my glasses. Lens coatings on polycarbonate lenses smudge so easily and I had tried numerous cloths. They cut smudges without needing sprays or liquids extremely well.

"This is an elegant and beautiful case for an iPhone 5 or 5S. The leather like material is soft and very comfortable to hold in your hand. It also makes it easier to hold in one hand while you work your phone with the other. I love the magnetic close flap, you don't have to fight with a button. The case comes with an cleaning cloth, front and back screen protectors and a stylus. The stylus works very well, a light touch easily opens apps. The plastic case holds your phone securely and it may take some fidgiting to get it out. The several pockets included can hold credit or debit cards and the case folds to use as a stand. I find it particularly useful for gym visits. I can carry this case and my membership card without needing a purse. I really love the light blue color.

"The Panasonic RP-BTD10-K headphones are a nice looking set. They are black with an adjustable (up & down) feature and soft cushioned ear pads. They are very comfortable to wear. Out of the box, the set includes the headphones, a charging cable and a cord cable to plug into your device if you don't want to go wireless and an owner's manual. That's it. For $200, you don't even get a carrying case. The box is minimalist. The set does not come fully charged. Fortunately, this set charges quickly, taking about 4.5 hours to fully charge. That is a big plus. The manual wants you to charge this using your computer, but I have no problems charging with an adapter. The unit cannot be on when charging, and the LED button glows red while charging and turns off when fully charged. I do like this, as it is easy to tell when charging is done. The left side ear cup contains the wired plug in port, LED On/OFF button and a covered port for charging and a reset button. The out side of the ear cup has a raised icon in the center for making or answering calls. The raised icon at the bottom is for pairing NFC with Android phones. The right side ear cup has raised icons for volume and playback controls. They are nicely spaced out so they won't easily be confused. The first-time turn on will cause the LED to blink both red and blue while searching for a device to connect to. Depending upon the device, you may have to enter a code or select a profile. I was able to connect using the headphone name on my iPhone. Pairing is not as easy as it should be. It took several attempts for first time pairing. The unit beeps when some functions are performed, but the volume is low you can barely hear it. There is no audible confirmation of status. My Turtle Beach i30 headset has audible confirmations, which I love. The sound quality is good, not much base and you really have to turn the volume up to hear. I don't play loud music to protect my hearing, but I do have to turn this unit up more to hear music. Call quality is great. The microphone carries my voice clearly and I can hear callers easily. You can listen to music about 30 hours before charging. This is a good effort that could've been better. While they are compact and comfortable, my Turtle Beach headphones are a much classier act with seamless pairing, better base and audible confirmations. They cost comparably to these, are beautifully packaged and come with everything you need. The Panasonic headset is great for calls, just ok for music.PROSVery comfortable to wearEar pads swivel, and have soft cushioningShort charging time, 4.5 hours, easy to tell when completeGreat call qualityRaised buttons, east to feel and useLong listening time between charges, about 30 hoursLightweight, easy to carryCONSUnit volume tends to be low, not much baseNo carrying cloth (for this price, it should've been included)Cover flap for charging port is flimsyHeadphones feel a bit cheapNo carrying case includedPairing takes a bit longer, tends to be hit or miss","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4NUCF1OZGX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWKKE6I#wasThisHelpful","RP4NUCF1OZGX8","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book recounting the author's experiences with an active habitation site. Ms. George has followed her first book with the latest happenings on her property. I enjoyed her first book and enjoyed this one as well. The first book recounted her discovery of what was in the woods near her home and the foundation of a group to further explore the surroundings. The second book covers more experiences, some quite frightening, that both the family and the group created to investigate these sightings had. The group is called the Carolina Cryptid Crew and you can view photos, videos and more on their website (search for Carolina Cryptid Crew), YouTube and Facebook. If you have read up on Sasquatch, you will recognize a good deal of the behaviors exhibited. The author also gives an honest assessment of the hazards and risks of Cryptid research. It can be dangerous. There are many accounts of expeditions into the woods and the Squatches are not happy about it. While Ms. George does take care, this should be a cautionary tale to respect nature. She also includes many accounts of encounters at the end and provides lots of Links to her sites. Like the first book, this is a compelling account of encounters. I eagerly await the further adventures of Ms. George and the Crew.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1305LT4M97P2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDQSGFA#wasThisHelpful","R1305LT4M97P2Q","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wear these to work and they are fantastic. Easy on Velcro straps that adjust are better for me than laces.  Very comfortable foot bed. I really love the sturdy support. While they are not designed as orthopedic, they are a cost effective alternative. They help maintain a good balance. New Balance is the lone shoe maker that commits to manufacturing their products here in the US. A great many shoe manufacturers don't make larger size or wider width shoes.

"Engrossing account of a purported Bigfoot attack. I generally prefer real accounts of encounters or documentary books on Bigfoot, so initially, I thought that this was a true story. At the very end of the book, a notation in small print stated that this was a work of fiction. That was disappointing. It should've been noted up front that this was a work of fiction.That being said, it is a very good story, with a lot of bad language. I mention this for readers who may not care for that. The story concerns efforts to find the perpetrator of several attacks at a campground site. I won't give away theme rest, as it should be discovered. This book is an engrossing tale and very realistic and enjoyable. I give it four stars, one deducted due to the fact that it is a work of fiction and not a real account.

"The new TheraBreath Soothing Oral Rinse is indeed soothing. It has Aloe, Chamomile, Xylitol and Oatmeal extract among other ingredients. It has a very pleasant taste and your gums will feel refreshed. That being said, it was designed to help reduce stains and slight discomfort. It is Not designed to reduce plaque or bacteria, nor will it help with sore gums. While it is a good product and does soothe the gums, you will need to look elsewhere if you are having gum issues. This is a somewhat pricey product for something that doesn't do much. Sore gums are generally caused by bacteria or plaque and require a dentist's care. A good herbal Oral Rinse like Jason's Healthy  Mouth or mouthwash that reduce plaque and bacteria or gingivitis would be a better option (without alcohol).

"This book is an insider's account of several BFRO expeditions that took place in Canada. For those interested in how the BFRO conducts expeditions and what type of personnel and attributes are required, this will be an interesting read. Some prior reviewers have noted that they found this book to be boring. If you would like stories of Squatch encounters, there are a number of books available, most notably, Rusty Wilson's Bigfoot Campfire Stories. All editions are great. Blaine McMillan is giving readers the real nuts and bolts of what Squatch searching is all about. It is often not glamorous, can be tedious and thrilling on a moment's notice. The BFRO, founded by Matt Moneymaker of ""Finding Bigfoot"", is a serious organization dedicated to learning about Sasquatch. They approach the subject as real and do not intend to harm them. Their focus is learning about the species. This book tells the reader a great deal about many of the behaviors mentioned on the show. BFRO members often conduct a great of background work, interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence and helping to set up town hall meetings for the show. It is this methodical research that gives insight to this elusive creature. Besides recounting several expeditions, he also gives excellent advice on how to prepare and what to do if you would like to join an expedition. A limited number of outings are open to the public after a screening process. Membership is by invitation only, this being done to weed out undesirables. While there are other groups, (research styles are often a hot topic in the Bigfoot community), the BFRO is the oldest organization investigating Bigfoot and they take the subject seriously and treat witnesses with respect. Investigators like Blaine are the backbone of Bigfoot research and much of what we know comes from their dedicated effort. There is also some great history of Bigfoot research and researchers included, along with several interesting hypothesis and footnotes with info, should you wish to delve further. A great book for serious Bigfoot fans and for the novice who wants to know what really happens in the field. I hope he publishes more tales.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRN7GMAHIZ7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV7Q7G6#wasThisHelpful","R2XRN7GMAHIZ7N","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wonderful collection of laundry bags in various sizes. The bags are sturdy, yet allow clothing to get clean and dry. There is a unique flap (you can see it in the photo) that you push the zipper through that keeps the contents from spilling out. You must push the zipper through the expandable flap before you put your bag in the laundry or the bag will open and your items will spill out. If the zipper is tucked into the flap (gently push it through to come out the other side) your items will stay secure. Use the right amount of items per bag size for effective cleaning and drying. This is a great value and a great way to secure loose items that can be lost like socks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A9IRA57RN2VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVLRAFG#wasThisHelpful","R1A9IRA57RN2VO","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Adidas bag is a large, roomy sports bag that is great for taking clothing and gear. There is a large main compartment and two zippered side compartments. The bag has a removable, cushioned strap for carrying and a larger shoulder strap that is also removable. While the duffel bag is a nice comfortable size (it looks more like a medium size bag than a small one),  it is notable for what it lacks. The main compartment has a double zipper opening, with a tiny inside zippered pocket. It should've been a lot larger. I have a Champion upright tote style bag that I use for a gym bag and it has many large pockets, zipper enclosures and two nice deep pockets on the inside to fit a variety of items, including a water bottle. The Adidas bag does not. There is a mesh style on one side of the bag that looks like it is a pocket, but it's not. The bottom is nice and sturdy and it is very easy to carry. For a ""small"" bag it does hold a lot of items. A change of clothing and shoes fit with plenty of room to spare, but the lack of pockets is a glaring omission.

"This a highly accurate, easy to use blood pressure monitor. Omron is a leader in medical monitoring devices and they make quality products. I previously had a Panasonic monitor that did not work as well as the Omron. First, the Omron comes with a cuff large enough to fit larger arms. With the Panasonic, the larger cuffs had to be special ordered. Instructions and set up are easy, I set the date and time in minutes and was up and running in less than 10 minutes. Place the cuff on your arm above the elbow with the tube facing away (there are illustrations to show proper placement), extend your arm and don't move while the cuff inflates. It will give you your Systolic, Diastolic and heartbeat readings in a few fast minutes. While this model doesn't have Bluetooth compatibility, there are some great free and low cost apps that will allow you to track your readings over time. This device will remember about 40 readings, but I use a mobile app instead. The numbers are nice and large and very easy to read. Batteries come with the device, but don't last too long, especially if you are taking a lot of readings.

Simply plug in the QuikVolt charger, verify that the green light is lit, then connect your USB cable to your device and charge while you drive.

I always enjoy tales where people who have a great deal of experience in the wild learn that there are indeed things in the woods they didn't expect. The author tells of his many forays into the woods and his obvious love of nature. Despite that he has an early encounter he isn't quite sure about and doesn't take his father's advice to not return to that section of woods. He later doesn't take his own advice and finally learns that we are not the top of the chain in the wild.

I had first learned about several versions of this legend on Destination America's Monsters and Mysteries in America, one of my favorite shows. Author Couch presents an exhaustively researched guide to the varying versions of the legend in several states. This work is a well balanced approach between speculation, critical review and folklore. Encounters stories are presented and critiqued. Sources are quoted and many links to websites, referenced books, articles and films are included for the reader to review on their own. The author also debunks some sites purporting to be real.

I have read many books on encounters with Sasquatch, some of the contact she has experienced concerns me.

"This book is a collection of stories and encounters with cryptid by an author who works in the field. There are a number of tales I am aware of and a few I hadn't heard. While there is some background given and stories of encounters told, the author also attempts to inject some humor as well. This is an uneven approach, sometimes serious, sometimes lighthearted with grammatical errors. While sometimes informative, it does not go as in-depth as other books have. If you are a fan of Monsters and Mysteries in America, you will recognize several of the tales told here and the author was featured in an episode. The chapters are short and it is a fast read. It left me wanting more. I didn't find many spooky either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KUGN1TEYISF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8SKM6S#wasThisHelpful","R9KUGN1TEYISF","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very sad to learn that the annual Sydney Omarr guides were no longer being published. There are a great many guides of varying quality available and many don't have the information that the Syndey Omarr guides had. This Horoscope Guide is the best I have seen of the many I have sampled. I prefer information regarding planetary transits relating to signs and monthly overviews, not necessarily day by day. This guide gives major transit information for the major planets, monthly overviews, a few celebrity charts and Sun sign pairings. It has an informative approach, giving you information you can use as a guide for planning, rather than deep explanations and love guides so many other books spend so much time on. You will see overviews for love, money and career, but with some great common sense tips. This strikes (for me) a perfect balance of planetary transits with dates and chart emphasis with monthly guides. Key word being ""guide"" not unrealistic forecasts that many other books are fond of using. The Horoscope 2015 is available for each sign and in a combined guide for all signs. A well done effort to fill a void left by the loss of the Sydney Omarr guides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IW1QK3X2A917/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFO240O#wasThisHelpful","R1IW1QK3X2A917","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have worn several different bra liners from different manufacturers and this set is the best I have ever used. The liners are larger, soft, comfortable and hold moisture at bay. Not only are they comfortable, but they stay put! Other liners I have worn were short and small and would frequently come loose and fall out. These stay put and I often forget I am wearing them.

"This is my second Fintie cover I have purchased, I have one for my older 8.9 Kindle HD, it still protects it well. This new cover has a nice, colorful outer side and a black colored inner side.There is a cradled section that holds the device securely. Unlike the larger version of this case, there are no cutouts for the device buttons, so you have to constantly take it out of the secured section to reach the buttons, camera, on off button and volume rocker. You can fold the cover to act as a stand and the cover folds over to give solid support. I give it four stars with one off due to the lack of cutouts.

It is expandable, comes with sturdy cardboard inserts with month and number inserts that easily slip into the tabbed headers.

Simply put one end of the drawstring into the catch loop and push the other larger rounded end through one hole and gently push until you reach the other end. This is a life saver!  I have workout pants that unfortunately are only available with drawstring and two pairs had lost them. I didn't want to buy new pairs so I decided to order this item.

"This is a collection of four books in one set. The set covers the marriages of the Queen and Prince Philip, Charles and Diana, Charles and Camilla and Prince William and Catherine. Each book was interesting, offering many juicy tidbits about palace intrigue and offering insights into the subjects. Despite the title, this book does present a realistic portrait of the couples, including friction and love triangles. I had read quite a bit about some and I found this set to be very informative. I learned quite a bit about each couple. For me the most interesting books were those about Prince Charles and Diana and Charles and Camilla. An example, Diana was deeply disturbed about Charles and Camilla and even wanted to back out of the wedding. The author takes a fair and balanced approach, not bashing anyone. If you are interested in the lives of Britain's Royal Family, you will enjoy this book. It was an eye opener and interesting reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LCW75LXW244/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ULH5LI#wasThisHelpful","R8LCW75LXW244","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of Charles and Camilla is truly a love story. They were evenly matched and she was the only person besides the late Louis Mountbatten that really understood and supported him. While many of us thought we knew Diana's side of the story, her marriage was engineered to keep the monarchy going. Having known more about Diana's upbringing and early life, I wanted to learn about Camilla's. She had a warm and loving family, and while not the most beautiful, she had a great personality that endeared her to many in her younger days. It was rather sad to learn the depth of loneliness in Charles' upbringing and Camilla was really his strength. If you have an open mind, (many still can't forgive Camilla for the breakup of Charles and Diana's marriage, the age difference and Diana's stellar personality, along with little common ground had really doomed it from the start) this is a fascinating story about a very brave woman who has endured a great deal of difficulty with grace for the man she loves. It is also an eye opener for what was really going on behind the scenes. Found this hard to put down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49E5B1M99QPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KFLV86#wasThisHelpful","R49E5B1M99QPV","A3NE5KEHD57Q6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE5KEHD57Q6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:45 MinsThis bus is full of disco rainbow magic. I laughed when I first turned it on because it is such an energetic and flashy toy. The detailing from paint job to little seats and bus mirrors are all there and makes this bus a nice and realistic looking toy. Then you turn the off switch to on and you've got a bump and go toy. Along with the roll around regular wheels there is a set of spinning wheels underneath that make is so the bus can go on it's own and turn around by itself when it runs into a wall. The head lights come on as regular lights and inside of the bus has flashing and color changing lights that flash to the music. I like that there are side windows and sunroof panels so you can really see the light show. The music is upbeat and quite loud. I did find it a bit redundant as it repeats the same two almost incoherent lines in a loop but it still made us laugh because it's so peppy. I would have expected something like ""The wheels on the bus"" and it's definitely more energetic than that. My sister and I were taking guesses at what the bus was singing and my guess on the first line is ""Far away from Dixie Town"" for the second line I thought I made out the words ""family magazine"" but I'm not all that sure. Most parents aren't really fans of loud noise making toys but kids certainly love them. We had fun making a game of guessing the lyrics so it made the noise much more tolerable than other toys we've had in the past. I do wish the bus had an option to run the lights with out the music though for times we'd prefer quiet play. Other than that this is a cute toy that kids will love. .I am very impressed with the price in comparison to many other companies. I would deff recommend this to my family and friends.

"I tend to gravitate towards darker coffees with a deep ""coffee"" flavor rather than any of that light, medium, or fancy flavored stuff. I like my coffee to taste like coffee and I want it to be strong enough that I still get a full bodied coffee flavor after adding a little cream and sweetener.But I hate coffee with a bitter taste and acidic aftertaste, which is where most coffees go once they get in the bold flavor range.

"I hate cases I was really getting a case on a phone that was this thin. I feel like cases completely take away from the design of the phone so I never really used one. That being said this case is fantastic. It protects the metal well from wearing and scratches. It won't protect against drops or anything but I also rarely drop my phone so that's not much of a problem. The semi see through finish shows off the design of the phone well and in my opinion makes the ugly antenna breaks look really nice. I love the thinness of the case so much so that I forget I even have one on. People are amazed when I show them this case and ask where they can get one for their phone. Just one thing I will say is the case is so thin, it's thinner than the camera protrusion on the phone. So the metal ring has started to wear around the edges of the camera despite having the phone less than a week. The lens however is made of sapphire crystal so I doubt that will scratch. I would not want the case to be any thicker though to cover the camera protrusion. That would defeat the purpose of such a thin case..I am very impressed with the price in comparison to many other companies. I would deff recommend this to my family and friends.

"This stand is a bit of an oddity in my opinion. Basically, its a large magnifying glass. The packaging makes it seem like its an additional display, but its really just a specialized frame for a magnifying glass. Now, as silly as it might sound, this is actually kind of a nice idea. The magnifying glass sits at an angle and there is a small perch on the back of the frame for the iPhone to sit in. It does work. For people who have problems viewing text on their phone, this device can really help. The concept is interesting, but the execution is a little bit lacking. First, the frame is made of plastic and its very lightweight because of this, you really have to use it on a flat surface. Second, the stand made for the iPhone is a bit flimsy and there is nothing included to hold the phone into place. While testing it out, I had the phone slip on my several times. For prolonged usage, I think some people might get pretty frustrated with it. That being said, because its made from plastic, its very durable and travels well. The frame folds completely flat. .I am very impressed with the price in comparison to many other companies. I would deff recommend this to my family and friends.

"I am one of those pen fanatics. You know, especially if you are one too. Whenever I see a pen laying around, I have to pick it up and write with it. If it glides on smooth and looks good, I will slip it into my purse. These gel pens come in every conceivable color. There are several sets within the set. There are glitter pens, metallic pens, pastels and bold. There is a pen for every occasion. Bright reds and greens for signing and decorating Christmas cards, pinks, blues, gold, silver. This is an artists treasure trove. Kids and adults love them for their artwork and crafts or just everyday writing.

That and a very steady hand! I'm not a professional by any means or licensed but I love nail art and expressing my creativity. They're not a high end set of tools but I don't want them to be! Nail polish, glitter, glue...it is messy! The brushes are long and very light weight. Can be used to create different shapes, lines, designs and writing.

"It definitely is worth a buy if you want your kid to remember times tables randomly. To learn the times table I was not spending enough time with my daughter to ask her randomly all times table. She would know one table at a time after she moved on to next table, she would find it hard to remember the previous one. After I bought these flash cards, everyday she had to sit down and answer the multiplication on the card. Initially she would take time to answer, but after a week of pratice with the cards, she now knows all her tables from 0-12. Its excellent for kids to practice on their own. It helps with accuracy, speed and random order. Just remember to have your child review it every single day until he/she knows it all.

"Definitely as good as my ""Name Brand' fiber lash mascara. It is easy to apply, and comes with directions if you haven't used them before. You put on regular mascara, then use the long tube, then use the short tube with the fibers. I really liked that it came with an extra brush to separate the lashes and give it a more natural look.WOW! This product is amazing. I have never used 3D fiber Mascara before, so I did not know what I was missing out on. This stuff looks like I wear false lashes all the time with out actually wearing false lashes. I am always getting compliments on my lashes now and being asked what kind of lashes I have been wearing! I tell them that it is 3D Fiber Mascara and everyone is shocked! It is really simple to apply. All you have to do is put on the transplanting gel and then quickly apply the fibers to it. I usually wait for about 10-15 seconds and then apply another coat of the transplanting gel to set the fibers in. It does say to put on a coat of your favorite mascara before doing this, but I like it either way. I dont always apply my mascara first. Sometimes I do not wear mascara at all. The results are amazing! It also comes with an extra eyelash wand so that you can run through your lashes after applying the fibers and transplanting gel to help separate them. When I first started using the 3D mascara, I noticed that the lashes were falling a bit and were irritating my eyes a little, BUT I found out I was not letting them set long enough before applying the transplanting gel to set them in. I was applying it immediately after applying the fibers. It is best to wait for 10-15 seconds to let them set before applying your next layer of transplanting gel. This 3D Mascara also came in a nice case. I love the way it looks and it would make a wonderful gift to someone who loves makeup in general and someone who spends time on there lashes to make them look great!

"Quite large and easily fit all their pirate coins, candy, and other treasure. Easy to put together and a lot of fun! Bottoms do tend to form a gap if swung around a lot but that can easily be fixed with tape or simply not swinging them.These are fun party favors and went great with our Jake and the Neverland Pirates theme. I will say that the boxes were a little flimsy and didn't hold up well to the light items that we put inside. They served their purpose and were cute, just don't plan on putting anything too heavy inside.These are pretty big. Lots of loot can fit including regular size candy bars.

"I love the randomness of these stickers. They remind me of cool graffiti and I love the art style. I got a YouTube sticker in here and I will be using it with my Youtube channel videos maybe in my trailer when I make one for my channel. I haven't decided how I want to use it yet just that I do. I love all the different designs and the thought of using them just seems sad. I almost want to get a photo album and just put them in it and keep them as part of a new sticker collection. I love all the stickers and the hardest part is just figuring out where I want to stick them!The images for this product are very accurate. The stickers are very high quality in weight, stickiness, and design. The printing itself is perfect - it's not cheap or blurry - they're very clear, clean, and vivid printed. The stickiness is just fine, exactly what you need in a sticker, not lacking anything. And the weight is great - they're not thin and weak, they're high quality material that withstands anything you need it to. The assortment was really great and it was difficult to share but with so many stickers, that's the point of it :) I picked out a few of my favorites and was happy to share with everyone else.

"I purchased cheap soldering irons. All were crap. Amazon was quick to refund the items that were crap. I have watched these irons sold on ebay for over a year. But, they were 220VAC. I couldn't use it here and had to try it. It is small, light, extremely well built, Nice to use, and heats up quick. The variable temp works great. The nice thing is that it uses Hakko M900 tips that are readily available. And, with the heating element going inside the tip, there is MUCH less heat on the outside of the iron. It did not even discolor or smoke.I'm very pleased with the purchase. This is the right price and the right iron for me, the hobbyist.

"I'm not a professional chef, but I know my way around a kitchen. One thing I never stint on is knives. Cheap knives are a waste of time--good knives are a joy forever. By ""cheap"" I mean badly crafted knives, not inexpensive knives, because it's always possible to find a moderately-priced knives that outperforms knives double or triple the price.This is one of those knives.The handle is made of a grippy composite that allows you to securely hold firm if wet or in akward positions. The handle is a little longer than others I've owned, maybe too long for small hands, but it is contoured so you can move up towards the blade for better control. The blade does have a nice rocked contour, which makes chopping & dicing easier. I've grown to prefer ligher weight blades and you don't sacrifice much when it's this sharp. Overall I would say that for the price, this is a great chef knife..time will tell if any problems develop. Definitely doesn't have the same craftsmenship or allure of one of the high end Germans, but if your looking for a highly functional, lightweight, standard chef, it's hard to go wrong here.

"My husband and I really enjoy using toys to spice things up a bit and I'm always happy to try out a new interesting design I was quite intrigued. I really like the way this is made - even from when I first took it out of the box I could tell it was high quality. First of all, the vibe portion is a nice smooth silicone, which will stand up to a lot of use and makes it very easy to clean, a definite plus. The battery compartment (at the bottom of the unit has a really nice, secure lid that is easy to open.

"I really like this Argan oil shampoo, it smells almost citrusy. I washed my hair with it and added no conditioner to see how well it would condition and moisturize my hair alone and it did just that. I let my hair air dry a bit, I combed it , then let it air dry again. Even when my hair was damp my hair felt soft and looked shiny.First thing I noticed when I opened the box was how well it was packaged. It was perfectly in tact and didn't spill out anywhere (which is something that I have experienced a few times with other shampoos.) Then I opened it... I can't even explain just how awesome it smells. I ordered both the shampoo and the conditioner, so I was really in heaven when I washed my hair. Just after shampooing, my hair was immediately softer. After using the conditioner, my hair was in way better condition... even better than before my vacation! I wash my hair every 3 days, and even on day 3 my hair still smells amazing!! It is also sulfate free, which is how every shampoo should be, because that stuff is terrible for your hair!!I am very impressed with the price in comparison to many other companies.

"I've used them three times and they have definitely cut drying time. I can't say exactly by how much as I have an auto-sensing dryer and am not often around right when the cycle finishes, but have been surprised a couple of times to pass the laundry and realise the cycle is already over! I've noticed that the clothes are softer, and my third load had actually gone cold by the time I took the clothes out but they were softer and less creased than they would have been without the dryer balls.

"I think if they released the same beautiful designs on a more softer paper, it would lend better to coloring with colored pencils; I don't mind picking up a set of nice bullet-tips markers for my hobby, and I can't wait to finish a page with markers. I like the accomplishment of coloring in space, but I don't get that same satisfaction since my colored pencils (which aren't low-end) leave a lot of pigment in each section.This is a nice, big, thick coloring book with probably twice as many pages as most of my other coloring books. The pages are thick, almost cardstock thick, and the designs are on one page only. Dark colors show through to the other side, but they dont bleed onto the next page, so this coloring book is perfect for markers. The designs are fairly intricate, better suited for bullet-tipped markers than (my preferred Mr. Sketch) chiseled tip markers.

"If you like base-plates to build on and have duplo's this is a perfect fit for you. I find it helps my son focus on building in one area and gives him a great spot to build multiple items. Great for kids who love to play with Duplos - these are nice and sturdy made of hard plastic and do not bed - perfect for pretending like there is grass to build a house or barn. These are for the Duplos though which are the larger Legos for younger kids. You get a pack of 4 square baseplates that are 7.5"" each side and there are 12 ""dots"" per side so your kids will have plenty of room to build their castles in the sky!

"I love essential oils. They have tons of different uses and can help with many different ailments. Since I use oils in so many ways I buy them in large bottles to save money. These little bottles are fantastic. I can fill them from my large bottles to keep them handy and not have to bring out the large bottles each time I need oilor many oils. The lovely, tiny essential oil bottles from Cornucopia Brands are perfect to fill from a larger bottle or to even fill with a mixture of oils. I make many of my own oil blends for hair, skin and nails. I can make up a large batch and fill the bottles or if I only need one, I can actually drop in the small bottle, add the reducer so only a few drops is dispensed at one time, cap it and it is ready for a sample or gift. This assortment of 50 bottles includes 3 ml and 2 ml bottles. Both are fine for giving or selling once filled. They also function perfectly as small pill bottles for a short trip. They can also be filled with seasonings, or flavor oil blends. The bottles came in 2 different sizes which is perfect because I can use the smaller sizes for giving oils to friends who are interested in trying oils but wary of if they work or not and dont want to spend money on their money until they have tried them. I can use the larger bottles for this too but mainly use the larger bottles for myself. The smaller bottles are also great for oils that I dont use as much of like Ylang Ylang or Geranium.I am very impressed with the price in comparison to many other companies.

"This 18-inch Christmas stocking is an oversized stocking that adds a spectacular 3-dimensional feel to traditional decorating. From afar, it looks like any other stocking, but up close, the intricate details come to life. The snowmen have scarves and carrot noses! The snowflake in the corner shines with glitter. The green stocking cap is non-woven. The best part is how much this stocking can hold. I would not recommend filling it with heavy objects, though. We plan on using it as a decorative piece over the fireplace. This is a stocking that I am proud to display. Compared to our local arts and crafts stores, this is a higher quality product at a much better price. I highly recommend this productI was excited to get this Christmas Stocking by Ohuhu. Hanging the stockings over the fireplace is one of my favorite parts of Christmas. I love seeing all the stockings lined up with each family members name on it and seeing it year after year. I really like that Santa fills each stocking with everyone's personal favorites. To me, this makes a Christmas stocking very personal. This stocking is really cute! I love the snowmen with all the raised 3D details. It is well made and a good size for stuffing with goodies. I do think that the name should be changed, because this is not a Kit, the stocking is already put together, it can be personalized with a name, but the stocking is already put together.

"These are great when keeping your tea or coffee warmer for a little longer than the usual time expected in your mug! Alway while walking down the halls at walk it helps not to spill water out your mug.These are very useful. Although the amount of suction provided is questionable, they not only keep your drink hot but keeps out bugs, gives an extra few seconds of spill control, acts as a drink glass label, AND I gave them to my teen girls to take with them when they go out. Not a guarantee of safety, but when suctioned on a glass (I just don't think they would suction on a plastic container), it makes random drug drops just that much harder.

"The speaker sounded better than I expected it would. While not as good as a stereo of course, it does provide a good rich sound that compares to lower end bluetooth portable speakers that I have experienced.Not as programmable as I would like as far as cycling through the colors and setting cycle time. The music app is also limited from my early investigations - playlist support and grouping by artist or album would be nice additions. If there was also a way to flash to the input from other music apps or just the phone's mic, that would be cool as well. CORRECTION !! You CAN play music through the other apps on the phone and have the light respond. I had to hit the Auto option in the bulb color control panel (think that was where it was) and it will flash as well.Really cool device for the price.

"Great bulb!!! I've been trying to switch over to LEDs as much as possible, but we have many open fixtures that really look crappy with anything but Edison bulbs. This was a great alternative to Edison bulbs. Yeah they're expensive and I probably wouldn't bother with the more decorative fixtures I have just because of price.

"The best mascara EVER! Worked as expected.Works just like the more expensive ""3D"" mascara. Both of them have good points, no fake lashes, length, easy to use. The down side is even being extremely careful you can end up with clumpy lashes or that ""spider leg"" looking eyelashes.You have the same issue with the expensive stuff.

"Okay I know this is not for hair loss but I have been using the shampoo for about a month. My hair loss has been pretty significant, with thinning hair working its way back to the point at the top of the back of my head. I don't want to jump the gun, but I think this stuff actually works. Hair has been growing in where it was not before. Hair that was already there is getting longer instead of being stunted. The hair is also thicker and fuller than it was. I have a long way to go but it is definitely doing something.

"These pens are amazing. I normally order from JetPens, but these were available from Amazon at a cheaper price and included prime shipping. These pens are great.

I do the everything word-search puzzles with different colors of pens and these are thin enough to do them. The glitter are subtle,(which I prefer) The neon are great!!! They have the colors I love and are hard to find. The case is very nice. I would highly recommend!!! I do not have to keep buying pens any more, these are it for me!!!Pens were delivered quickly and came in a very nice case. I love the fine tips and smooth flow of the ink.

"There are two DIFFERENT types of almond oil, sweet almond oil and bitter almond oil. Bitter almond oil is darker, smells more like almonds, and is considered an essential oil. Sweet almond oil is a fixed oil, which is why it feels well- oily! Sweet almond oil will not smell like almonds, even though it comes from the tree that produces the types of almonds that we eat so ravenously. Also, sweet almond oil is considered an ALL PURPOSE face moisturizer (kind of similar to coconut oil where you can cook with it but also put it in your hair, but it doesn't smell like coconuts-thank goodness). Where as bitter almond oil is not a fixed oil but rather an essential oil (repeating myself for clarity) and it isn't used in any way for skin care! It doesn't even have any aromatherapy benefits! It simply smells good, and therefore it goes into things like almond soaps, lotion bars, and lip balms. People just assume that the darker sweeter smelling almond oil therefore has the benefits that sweet almond oil has. So- for those people questioning themselves buying this and thinking, ""I don't want to rub veggie oil on my face! Plus it won't smell like anything!"" please, calm down, take a deep breath and buy this. Seriously, do what I say and buy it right now. I use this in my body scrubs all the time, and when I say this I mean this specific brand! It's awesome!General Skin Care : As a skin aid, I use the Almond Oil on my dry skin, after my shower before toweling dry.

"This water reservoir is really easy to use. The end of the hose has an on/off switch, which makes sure nothing comes out unless you want it to. You have to bite on the end of the hose in order to get water out. It took me a few tried to get use to doing it this way, so some of my drinks were plenty of water and some were just a little bit. The bag is a durable, flexible material. Feels like silicon or soft, heavy plastic? This bag would be easy to carry in a backpack or attach to something with the little holes at the top. It's also insulated to keep your water cool.This water pack is perfect for bike riding or marching band practice or anywhere you might need water on the go stored behind your back!

I also wanted to make sure it held it tightly without covering any of the buttons. This is perfect.

"I discovered several years ago that Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed is the best all-purpose lawn seed to use.  My coworker, Michelle, is a fanatic about keeping her lawn pristine.  She also uses the Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed.  My parents also use it on their lawn and they live approximately five-hundred miles away from me.  I live in Chesapeake, Virginia, and they live in Maryville, Tennessee, which is a growing community outside of Knoxville.  It is a hop, skip and jump from Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg.  My parents terrain is different from mine.  Their soil is probably more fertile than mine.  Mine is sandier since the beach is less than thirty miles away.  About three years ago I bought my condo.  Soon afterwards, I learned that the neighborhood children had been using my left side yard as a shortcut for walking to school in the mornings and afternoons.  That soon stopped when I erected a fence.  (A few hoodlums tried climbing over it.)  A large bare spot remained in my yard.  I took the advice of a professional employee at a lawn and garden center and covered it with Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed.  After a few months of faithful usage, the bare spot had beautiful grass growing on it.  Now I use it on my entire lawn, especially in the areas where it is difficult to grow grass such as in the shade of my larger trees.  Every time hurricane season approaches, I am tempted to cut them all down.  The grass seed is grainy like small rice pellets and dyed a bright baby blue.  It doesnt have any odor that I can detect and has never caused me to have an allergic reaction.  I often handle it with my bare hands.  The seed spreads easily when I use my Easy Hand-Held Broadcast Spreader.  The bags are re-sealable.  I prefer the largest bags because they seal much easier and are more cost effective.  Last week, I recently spread the seed after raking up all the leaves that had fallen in my yard.  I am currently visiting my parents for Thanksgiving and their lawn is one of the greenest in a neighborhood that is comprised mostly of doctors and lawyers.  My parents dont have a professional lawn care service.  They maintain their own lawn and rely heavily on Scotts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123QCM3CAT671/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHOZ3QC#wasThisHelpful","R123QCM3CAT671","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave the Sapphire Oval Pendant Necklace from the Amazon collection to my girlfriend, Tammy, and she loved it.  I know the stones are lab created but they look genuine.  If Tammy hadnt already known that the necklace came from the Amazon Vine Program, she wouldve thought I had paid a small fortune for it at a renowned jewelry store.  The stones are dazzling.  Tammy couldnt wait to wear the necklace.  She has a hard time fastening it herself; I wish the clasp was larger.  I bought a twenty-four inch stainless steel chain on which to hang this Sapphire Oval Pendant and other pendants I have bought Tammy in the past.  Unfortunately, the Sapphire Oval Pendant wont readily come off the extremely slender, fragile chain upon which it is attached.  A jeweler can probably detach it and form a hook for hanging it on the twenty-four inch stainless steel chain.  Tammy needs a long chain in order to put it over her head rather than fastening it herself; her hands shake too much and Im not always there to fasten it for her.  Overall, the Sapphire Oval Pendant is gorgeous.  Tammy posted photos of the necklace on her FaceBook account and they went virile.  Many of her friends and relatives were impressed.  Some thought I had paid a fortune for it.

"I love deep-fried onion rings, but I was never able to prepare them until now.  Thanks to the Proctor Silex Professional Style Deep Fryer (Model No. 35041), I can enjoy restaurant-style onion rings, French fries and chicken tenders, but cleanup is anything but fast.  This deep fryer is advertised as a personal one.  It is great for meals that I prepare for my girlfriend, Tammy, and I.  Tammy loves crinkled fries and she really enjoyed the ones I deep fried with the deep fryer from Proctor Silex.  It is easy to assemble and use thanks to an easy-to-read, easy-to-follow instruction booklet.  Looking at its small size, one would think that it wouldnt hold much oil.  However, it will hold six cups of oil.  Never exceed the maximum level line of six cups.  The minimum level line is four cups.  Most oil is sold in forty-eight ounce bottles.  According to the booklet, vegetable oil is the best to use.  Most of my friends purchase Wesson all-purpose vegetable oil.  The oil can be reused around eleven times but it must be strained using paper towels or cheese cloth.  I used paper towels placed over a stainless steel colander placed on a stainless steel pot.  It did a fair job of straining the oil.  After straining, I used a funnel to pour the oil back into the same bottle in which it was bought.  I plan to purchase a metal container with a removable strainer such as the Cook N Home 1-1/2 Quart Stainless Steel Oil Storage Can (Cook N Home 1-1/2-Quart Stainless Oil Storage).  A coworker of mine, Karen, once owned a deep fryer with its own filter; unfortunately, the filter became permanently clogged and she threw the deep fryer away.  I have been using my Proctor Silex Deep Fryer for nearly a month and havent suffered any burns.  Grease fires and grease burns were a major concern of mine.  I always turn the dial to off and unplug it immediately after my portable kitchen timer begins loudly buzzing.  When cooking in the kitchen, I always wear an apron for protecting my skin and clothes.  I also wear an oven mitt when handling anything to do with the deep fryer, especially the lid and basket handles.  When lifting the lid, I keep the lid angled towards me so that hot steam is directed away from me.  After the deep fryer has heated to its proper temperature, as indicated by the illumination of both the green and red lights, I remove the lid and raise the basket clear of the oil before gently dropping the onion rings, French fries, chicken tenders, etc., into the basket and replacing it inside the deep fryer.  This Proctor Silex deep fryer has two safety features that I really like.  The best one is the magnetized cord that will become detached when it is pulled.  This will prevent children from pulling the deep fryer off the counter and horribly burning themselves.  Also, if the deep fryer overheats, it will automatically shut off; the owner will have to use the sharp point of a knife, pen, fork, etc., to push the red, recessed reset button located on the back of the machine.  (The deep fryer could overheat if the oil level doesnt reach the minimum line.)  I highly recommend the Proctor Silex Professional Style Deep Fryer (Model No. 35041) for the average American kitchen because it is small, economical, and easy to operate.  A built in filter and its own timer would have made it nicer.  Nevertheless, this deep fryer will make a great Christmas or wedding present for someone who loves to cook restaurant-style food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJ7QK6TYVVR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YUDZ8O#wasThisHelpful","RUJ7QK6TYVVR0","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, I requested New Chapter Zyflamend Wholebody in order to relieve the soreness in my legs after walking at least thirty minutes each day.  However, I discovered that it eased the pain in my left hip that is caused by the ruptured disc in my lower back.  I take two gel capsules with food to prevent the New Chapter Zyflamend Wholebody from upsetting my stomach.  I have never experienced any detrimental side effects such as rashes and hives.  The ingredients consist of mostly natural herbs that people use in teas to treat various ailments such as colds and flu.  I was amazed at how well the New Chapter Zyflamend Wholebody works.  It is less expensive and more effective than the anti-inflammatory drugs that neurological surgeons have prescribed me; it is also less likely to cause liver and kidney damage that prescription drugs cause.

"For two weeks, Ive been taking the Advanced Double Strength Joint Soother Supplement from Vitamin World in lieu of my Triple Strength Osteo Bi-Flex Supplement.  Both have the three essential elements that my family doctor said I needed after I ruptured the disc in my lower back more than ten years ago:  Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and MSM.  Both the Joint Soother and the Osteo Bi-Flex have 1,500 mg of Glucosamine.  The Joint Soother has 1,193 mg of a Mobili-Flex Proprietary Blend which contains primarily Chondroitin and MSM.  The Osteo Bi-Flex contains 375 mg of a Joint Shield Proprietary Blend which also contains primarily Chondroitin and MSM.  In other words, the Joint Soother has much more Chondroitin and MSM than the Osteo Bi-Flex.  The Osteo Bi-Flex has always relieved the pain in my knees; however, several months ago, the bones in my fingers began aching painfully.  Fortunately, after two weeks of taking the Joint Soother, the pain has been greatly alleviated.  One dose of the Joint Soother is three caplets and one dose of the Osteo Bi-Flex is two caplets.  The caplets from both brands are approximately the same size.  It is recommended that they be taken at a meal.  I take the three tablets of the Joint Soother before going to bed at night and have not experienced any adverse reactions.  I highly recommend the Advanced Double Strength Joint Soother Supplement.  It may cost more but it is worth it for taking away the pain in my hands.  Now I have returned to speed typing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POFTZMVJ9ONQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8XHAS#wasThisHelpful","R1POFTZMVJ9ONQ","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zak! Designs Sippy Cup is a big success with my grandniece, Danielle, who lives with me.  Danielle is always knocking her cups over, but the sippy cup doesnt spill.  (She took a shine to the one with the green dinosaur.)  In fact, if it wasnt for the childish designs, I would use these sippy cups myself.  My travel mugs are not spill proof; with age, their lids are becoming more difficult to screw on.  What I liked the most about the Zak! Designs Sippy Cup is that my sister-in-law Judith (Danielles grandmother) can use it.  Judith has Parkinsons; her right hand constantly shakes.  Normally, she has her own weighted insulated cup that is designed especially for those with Parkinsons.  Judith forgot hers when she came to visit Danielle for a week.  She found the Zak! Designs Sippy Cup adorable and functional.  I tried giving it to her as a gift but she insisted I keep it for Danielle.  She prefers her weighted insulated cup but the Zak!

"I am a graduate of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  I grew up in the land of the U.T. Vols.  Our blood runs deep orange.  I found the Hefty College Cups to be great for parties, especially if you are a Volunteer.  However, they are not as durable as I thought they would be.  They are definitely not reusable; they are intended for one-time use.  I have plastic cups from fast-food restaurants that Ive used for years; they are made of hard plastic and have walls that are thicker than these Hefty cups.  The designs on these Tennessee Volunteer cups are appropriate; they are indelible; they dont fade during usage and rub off on my hands.  The cups are too small to hold 18 ounces without spillage.  Overall, they are nice novelty cups for social events.  They arrived in three plastic sleeves containing 28 cups each.  I kept one sleeve and gave the other two to coworkers who liked them.

She loves to wear it everywhere she goes:  work, church, and gatherings with friends and relatives.  It sprays easily and is a fragrance that lasts a long time.  Normally, she wears Halston Perfume.

"Crescent has created a great tongue and groove plier set.  This plier set, and a couple of screwdrivers, is all I need for performing maintenance on my tractor or any of my other pieces of lawn equipment.  With the help of my nieces husband, Solomon, I recently installed a new trailer hitch on my tractor.  I learned that all three pliers in the set were perfect for every bolt and nut I had to install.  I found the insulated handles on the pliers to be very comfortable, no matter how much pressure I was forced to exert on them.  The jaws stay aligned at every position, from the smallest to the largest.  The handles remain at a comfortable gripping position, whatever positon of the jaw.  As far as the durability is concerned, I wont be using these pliers every day; therefore, they will probably outlast me.

"I love the 1001SL LED Lamp from SAFCO.  Ive used it on both the desk for my laptop computer and on my dining room table.  The desk for my laptop is very small.  There is barely enough room for my laptop and all its accessories (speakers, mouse, external hard drive, lamp, etc.).  The SAFCO lamp provides excellent lighting for when I am typing on my laptop.  Most of the time, however, I use the lamp on my dining room table where I do a majority of my reading.  (If I try reading in bed or in my lounge chair, I will probably fall asleep.)  The lamp is EXTREMELY flexible and I can always get the bright LED light close to my book.  I had to use a large screw driver to tighten the screw at the base so that it would lean over towards my novel without falling down.  I connected one end of the power cord into the back of the lamp and the other into a nearby wall socket.  While I am reading, I can charge my iPhone 5S by connecting it to a USB port in the back of the lamp.  This is very convenient.  Sometimes, when my girlfriend, Tammy, is travelling, she FaceTimes me late at night while I am reading.  I can charge the iPhone near me while I am reading and still be able to quickly answer it.  On the lamps base, there are seven buttons that can be used to dim the light and two buttons for changing the color temperature.  Honestly, I never use them.  I want the light to be very bright in order to prevent eye strain.  Also, the LED light never seems to get too hot to touch.  Overall, I am very happy with this extremely flexible light; it can be put anywhere on a cluttered table or desk and positioned in order to provide adequate light for reading.  This SAFCO LED lamp would make the perfect gift for anyone who reads a lot of books at a desk or table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9D6JAFOHJCKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7HCKW#wasThisHelpful","R9D6JAFOHJCKC","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I made my girlfriend, Tammy, very happy when I gave her the 18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Two-Tone Double Open Oval Pendant Necklace from the Amazon Collection.  It is beautiful, elegant, and very fashionable.  Tammy put it around her neck as soon as she got it out of the black satin box in which it arrived.  (The box was inside a Zip-lock-sealed plastic bag, which had been shipped to me inside a gray plastic bag lined with bubble wrap.)  With my iPhone 5S, I took photos of Tammy wearing it and close-up photos of the pendant itself.  Tammy posted the photos on her Facebook account; she received numerous positive feedback from friends and relatives.  They were very impressed.  I suppose they are expecting me to give her a ring for Christmas.  Some friends were rather disgruntled upon learning I had given her a new microwave oven for her birthday, but her old own had caught fire.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the pendants chain is extremely thin.  It appears as though it might easily break.  Tammy is contemplating buying a new chain from which to hang the pendant.  Furthermore, the chains clasp is a round one.  It is not the more secure crab-claw or lobster-claw clasp that I have on my expensive, pure-gold chains.  The pendant is beautifully designed and is of a size that can be clearly seen; however, it is not as large as what appears on Amazons website.  Neither is the diamond design as glamorous as what is depicted on the website.  On the website, the large pendant appears to be covered with rows of tiny, individual diamonds.  In actuality, the pendant has a diamond-cut surface; it sparkles but not as great as the one on the website.  Nevertheless, the pendant is a beautiful, elegant and fashionable piece of costume jewelry.  It would make an affordable birthday or Christmas present for someone special in your life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0BBVTLQ3IFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C605I4A#wasThisHelpful","RS0BBVTLQ3IFB","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girlfriend, Tammy, thought that DJ the dinosaur puppet (from Manhattan Toys line of Baby Genius products) was simply adorable.  I was able to easily insert my arm inside the puppets neck and clamp down on its mouth.  There is a flat button in the roof of its mouth that causes DJ to speak when it is pressed.  There is no volume control; I wish he spoke louder.  However, I am able to operate the puppet without it speaking.  Therefore, I can put on my own one-puppet plays or sing along to various songs.  My niece, Gianna, who lives with me, has been using this puppet to entertain her two children, baby Danielle and three-year-old Antonio, before they go to bed.  She also thinks that the dinosaur is adorable.  Danielle goo-goos and Antonio just grins while DJ reads a bedtime story.

"For years, Ive occasionally drunk the Clamato Original Tomato Cocktail (Clamato Original Tomato Cocktail, 32 fl oz bottles (Pack of 12)).  My general practitioner told me that tomatoes prevent prostate cancer.  I was fortunate to receive 32 ounce bottle of Clamato Preparado Tomato Cocktail from the Amazon Vine program.  The Preparado variety of Clamato tastes very spicy.  It definitely clears out my sinuses.  I drank four ounces of it before singing in the choir.  No more congestion.  The next morning, I poured a cup of ice cubes, approximately five to six ounces of the Clamato Preparado Tomato Cocktail, and an ounce of ABSOLUT vodka into a hurricane glass and stirred the contents with a celery stick.  It was a delicious concoction--spicy and relaxing.  I sipped it while reading M. C. Beatons latest Agatha Raisin mystery novel, Dishing the Dirt (Dishing the Dirt: An Agatha Raisin Mystery (Agatha Raisin Mysteries)).  The Clamato Preparado Tomato Cocktail reminds me of the Mr & Mrs T, Original Bloody Mary Mix (Mr & Mrs T, Original Bloody Mary Mix, 5.5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)).  The ingredients are similar.  Both are very spicy and both make excellent Bloody Marys.  Also, the Preparado makes an excellent marinade.  I cut up a pound of chicken breasts into tenders, sliced up a small green zucchini and a small yellow squash, and soaked them all for a day in a cup of Clamato Preparado Tomato Cocktail.  I poured the mixture, along with a one-half cup of olive oil, into my KitchenAid Cast Iron 3-Quart Casserole Cookware (KitchenAid KCLI30CRER Streamline Cast Iron 3-Quart Casserole Cookware - Empire Red) and baked at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.

"I gave the What Do You Hear? activity book from Baby Genius of Manhattan Toy to my good neighbors Cal and Marlene who live across the street from me.  They have two girls, Jackie, who is one-a-half years old, and Susan, who is three.  Marlene was excited about the book because she played drums in her high school band, which would explain the well-toned muscles in her arms.  Cal played the trumpet.  Marlene is hoping that the What Do You Hear? activity book will influence her two girls to play musical instruments.  According to Marlene, the youngest one, Jackie, laughs a lot while her dad, Cal, reads the book to her and presses the large musical note that is attached to the book via a red ribbon.  Unfortunately, the battery doesnt seem to be easily replaceable.  Therefore, this is not a toy that can be handed down from child to child or from generation to generation.  How long will the battery last?  I dont know.  In the meantime, Cal is having a good time using the book to play with Jackie.  Susan doesnt appear to be very interested in the book; perhaps Jackie is the more musically inclined among the sisters.  Nevertheless, the What Do You Hear? is a good teaching tool for young children; it will help them learn new sounds, especially those pertaining to music.  The book also has a mirror, and babies, Ive noticed, often stare at their reflections as though they are observing strangers.  (Our cats exhibit the same behavior.)

"My girlfriend, Tammy, fell in love with the Tawashi Fish-Shaped Scrubbers from Now Designs.  She collects all things that pertain to the sea.  In fact, in North Carolinas Outer Banks, she recently opened up a small booth at an antique mall.  The booth is called Tammys Collectibles.  It sells nautical items, including fish made from all types of materials ranging from onyx to coral to marble.  Tammy refused to allow me to use the fish-shaped scrubbers for cleaning dirty dishes.  In all honesty, the scrubbers are very small and light-weight.  The Amazon Vine Program mailed them to me in a padded envelope.  At first, I thought the envelope was empty; I couldnt believe anything was in it.  I opened the envelope and found the pair of scrubbers.  The scrubbers were taped inside their own protective, transparent bag.  They appear to be crocheted by hand.  Almost immediately, Tammy took down a couple of inexpensive prints of lighthouses and hung the fish in their place.  This is fine with me since the fish-shaped scrubbers looked too delicate for actually cleaning dishes, glasses, cookware, etc.  They would look great hanging in a kitchen, especially a rustic one.  The fish-shaped scrubbers coordinate well with a pair of lemon yellow homespun dishcloths from Now Designs (Now Designs Homespun Dishcloths, Lemon Yellow, Set of 2), which I also reviewed for the Amazon Vine Program.  I recommend the fish-shaped scrubbers as gifts for the chef who likes nautical-themed decorations in their kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PISHZN7YBQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PK30U#wasThisHelpful","R11PISHZN7YBQU","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A former U.S. Marshall, Simon Fisk is now a PI who locates abducted children. However, for twelve years he could never find his own missing daughter, six-year-old Hailey, who was taken from his Georgetown home. The case has gone cold, until now. Former FBI analyst Kati Sheffield texts Simon the photo of a young woman wanted for murder in Dublin, Ireland. She could very well be a grown Hailey. As Simon travels across Europe in search of this elusive woman, he becomes involved with gangsters who try to kill him. He also uncovers bizarre family secrets and learns that the evilness behind Hailey's abduction was always closer than he had ever imagined.Douglas Corleone's ""Gone Cold"" is the third entry in the Simon Fisk series and is definitely the best one to date. Simon is all alone. He is no longer looking for other people's abducted children. He is concentrating all his time, money and effort into searching for his daughter, Hailey. The reader can feel Simon's torment. He gets drunk every night. Kati's text is a flash of hope. He rushes to Dublin where he meets some strange allies. Then he is off to Glasgow, Scotland, where he becomes involved in a gang war between the Gilchrist Clan and the Maxwell Clan. A lot of gun play ensues. Everywhere he goes in Europe, Simon is wanted for murder.The chapters alternate between events in the present and the events that took place in Georgetown twelve years ago when Hailey was abducted. Readers gain an insight into FBI protocol in regards to missing persons. They will witness the gradual deterioration of Simon's marriage. He and his wife, Tasha, grow farther and farther apart until tragedy strikes them. Everyone, including neighbors, friends, relatives, and teachers, is considered a suspect in Hailey's disappearance. Soon it becomes evident that Simon's worst fears are realized. Hailey has been abducted by a stranger and chances of finding her grow slimmer with each passing moment. Eventually, the media loses interest in her disappearance, the FBI departs, and Simon is left without help.""Gone Cold"" is a fast-paced, emotionally packed novel about a family that has been torn apart by lust and greed. It centers on the dark secrets that family members can hide from one another for many years. We all yearn to belong to a group, whether it is a family, professional organization, church, etc. After reading ""Gone Cold,"" I contemplated the broken relationships that I have with family members. Now, the reasons for them being broken seem ridiculous and asinine. Hopefully, this novel will encourage readers to seek out broken relationships and try to mend and heal them before it is too late.Douglas Corleone's ""Gone Cold"" may be the last in the Simon Fisk series, which includes the excellent debut, ""Good as Gone,"" and ""Payoff."" It's an intriguing cloak-and-dagger series with plenty of gunplay. However, I prefer the more realistic Kevin Corvelli mystery series which is set in beautiful, sun-drenched Hawaii. Even though Corvelli is a morally corrupt lawyer who is also a borderline alcoholic, I think he possesses a certain je ne sais quoi that is quite appealing. ""Gone Cold"" wrapped up the Simon Fisk series rather nicely. On the other hand, I think Corvelli has many more mysteries to be solved in gorgeous Hawaii. It is the unique setting that initially drew me to that series. Nevertheless, I will be anxiously awaiting Corleone's next mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273QR2CGAPGKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006578X#wasThisHelpful","R273QR2CGAPGKB","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Belfast, Ireland, Ciaran Devine was only twelve years old when he was convicted for brutally slaying his foster father, David Rolston. Seven years later, Ciaran is paroled. Detective Chief Inspector Serena Flanagan still believes Ciaran is innocent; his older brother, Thomas, must've coerced him into confessing to Rolston's murder. Supervisors urge her to leave the case alone; both brothers served their time: Ciaran for murder and Thomas for being his accomplice. However, soon after Ciaran's release, anyone who angers Thomas is severely beaten or murdered.Stuart Neville's ""Those We Left Behind"" is a superb psychological thriller based on sibling abuse. It is the fifth installment in a unique, oftentimes bizarre, series involving the criminal underworld of Belfast, Ireland (""The Ghosts of Belfast,"" ""Collusion,"" ""Lost Souls,"" ""The Final Silence,"" and ""Those We Left Behind""). In Neville's latest novel, Detective Inspector Jack Lennon has been replaced as the protagonist. Serena Flanagan, who was introduced in ""The Final Silence,"" will now be the one whose life is in danger.Serena is a strong, intelligent woman who is very career driven. She is also married with two young children. As though her career and raising a family isn't stressful enough, she is recovering from breast cancer. She has joined a support group. Further complicating her life is a friend, Penny Walker, who informs her that her breast cancer has returned with a vengeance. That very evening, Penny is found dead by suffocation and her husband dead by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Serena finds this murder-suicide extremely suspicious.From the novel's onset, readers soon learn that Thomas has a perverse hold over his younger brother, Ciaran. At one point, as they lay together on the bed, spooning and caressing, I nearly believed they were lovers, but the novel never depicts that their relationship is ever sexual. Thomas is only two years older than Ciaran. Their age difference is not much. I could understand better if there existed a five years age difference such as the one between my older brother, Fred, and myself. Nevertheless, the relationship between the Devines is an abusive one.Ciaran is helpless without Thomas. He can't do anything without consulting his brother, without first obtaining his approval. He is trapped. Readers will feel much sorrow for Ciaran. I've read many novels where parents and spouses have exercised a dangerous control over other members of their family. This is the first one I've read that dealt with sibling abuse: one child abusing another. Unfortunately, the Devines are orphans, having been shuffled among numerous foster families.""Those We Left Behind"" is very different from the other novels in the series. It doesn't involve the supernatural, it doesn't have vicious serial killers, and it doesn't involve human trafficking. Neither does it have a high body count. It is not a shoot-'em-up crime drama. It is, however, a very unsettling, very disturbing, very emotional psychological thriller. Beatings, vandalism and an occasional corpse, however, do help maintain a fast pacing. Depending upon their preferences, some readers may think ""Those We Left Behind"" is the best in the series. Nevertheless, I don't want to be left behind when Stuart Neville's next novel is published.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y2PGBK4MCX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616956364#wasThisHelpful","R26Y2PGBK4MCX2","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When my girlfriend, Tammy, moved from her condo into mine, she accidentally left behind a numerous assortment of knives in a drawer beneath where the microwave oven once sat.  When she discovered they were missing, she raced back to the condo to retrieve them but they were already gone.  We assumed the real estate agent stole them because when we questioned her about them she became real nervous and tried to blame it on the movers.  Nothing else was missing but the knives.  Some of those knives were expensive Pampered Chef knives; a few had belonged to Tammys grandmother.  I wanted to give Tammy the 15-Piece Forge Triple Rivet Knife Set from Sabatier to help replace the knives she had lost.  She grew to absolutely love the Sabatier knives.  Several of them, especially the Santoku, reminded her of the Pampered Chef knives she had lost.  Unfortunately, the Sabatier Santoku is two inches shorter than the Pampered Chef one, which is seven inches long.  Because of its hollow grooves (grantons), this knife is very versatile and Tammy has used it to prepare many dishes.  Also, she buys a lot of fresh bread from Panera Bread and has used the Sabatier Serrated Utility Knife to slice the bread herself.  Tammy has already used the Sabatier Paring Knife to peel her apples and pears.  She hates the skin on fruits.  It doesnt bother me, which is probably good since Im horrible at peeling fruit.  Tammy always has to do this for me when preparing pies.  As for me, I use the Sabatier Kitchen Shears quite frequently to open up bags of frozen meals.  One evening I used the Sabatier Chef Knife to slice some chicken breasts to bake in my Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker; the breasts sliced fairly well.  I call the Chef Knife my Norman Bates Psycho knife.  I like to use it for cutting up various types of meat.  I own a similar set of knives from Chicago Cutlery.  I have had them for two years and the only one that shows signs of rust are the shears.  One blade has a spot of rust that I never could get off no matter how hard I tried.  I know that the knives from such sets as Sabatier and Chicago Cutlery are not to be put into the dishwasher.  The powder detergent will ruin the handles.  Neither are the knives to be left soaking in water for long periods of time.  They are to be washed and towel dried almost immediately after usage.  Unfortunately, I have friends who love to put everything in the dishwasher including thermometers, Teflon coated pans and pots, and their pets food bowls.  I try to hand wash everything that I intend to keep for a long time.  The Acacia block is gorgeous.  It is large and sturdy and safely holds the knives.  The knives themselves seem heavy and durable.  They arrived in good condition.  I inspected them carefully and there were no rust stains.  Tammys parents, Frank and Bev, came over on Friday, September 25th, for her birthday.  They fixed steaks on our outdoor grill.  We ate them using the Sabatier Steak Knives.  I cut up vegetables for the salad using the Sabatier Chef Knife.  Tammy assisted me with the Sabatier Slicing Knife.  Tammy had a wonderful birthday.  (The weather was good compared to what it is now; were preparing for Hurricane Joaquin.)  Overall, the 15-Piece Forge Triple Rivet Knife Set from Sabatier is a great set of knives.  However, they are a little pricey compared to similar brands.  I would still recommend giving them as a gift to the special chef in your life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVJGCMGA4FH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01004S94O#wasThisHelpful","R2EVJGCMGA4FH7","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to show my appreciation to my neighbors, Cal and Marlene, who live directly across the street from my condo.  They are nice people who attend my church; they also keep an eye on my home when I am on vacation.  They have carried many an Amazon Vine package across the street to the safety of their home.  They have two little girls:  Jackie is approximately one-and-a-half years old and Susan recently turned three.  Last week, I gave Susan a Dots doll from the Adora My First collection.  I mentioned in an earlier review that I gave Jackie a Baby Stella from Manhattan Toy [Manhattan Toy Baby Stella Peach Soft Nurturing First Baby Doll (new for 2015!)].  Dots reminds me of a Raggedy Ann doll except there is nothing raggedy about her.  Just from closely inspecting her clothes and feeling her face and hands, I can tell she is made of high-quality material.  If taken care of, Dots should last many years.  Susan seems like a quiet, responsible child who takes care of her toys.  Ive never seen her throw temper tantrums and abuse anything.  Cal and Marlene would never allow it.  One day, Susan might be able to give Dots to her daughter.  I still have some of my moms dolls but I never played with them.  For one thing, they were so old-fashioned.  The clothes can be removed and cleaned.  Marlene, who was trying to assist me with my review, told me she washed the dolls clothes before taking Susan to see her grandparents.  She washed them in cold water on delicate cycle and hung them up to air dry.  They washed well.  My biggest worry about washing doll clothes is that they will tear at the seams.  This happened over ten years ago when I was washing clothes that went on the bears in my VanderBear collection.  I had to have a friend repair Corneliuss ripped jacket.  Dot herself shouldnt be put into the washing machine.  It is best to clean her with a damp sponge or washcloth.  Stains can be removed with the Shout Wipe & Go Individual Wipes [Shout Wipe & Go Instant Stain Remover (Pack of 4)].  I use these on my clothes at home and at work and on my carpets, pillows, bed spreads, and other items I dont want to throw into the washer for fear of damaging them.  Just dab a little bit of the product on the stain, let it soak for thirty seconds, and use water to bring it out before air drying.  According to her parents, Susan loves Dot; she plays with her a lot both inside and outside her home.  Cal is a successful GP and has filled Susans playroom with a make-believe kitchen that is better than my real one.  Dot has become a companion of Susan whenever she is cooking in the kitchen or entertaining her sister, Jackie, and other guests at her table and chairs that are made specifically for children her size.  She has numerous plush toys.  (Some of them were manufactured by Dakin and belonged to me when I was a child.)  Jackie loves her animals but she can identify more with Dots.  Even at such a tender age of three, there is a motherly instinct inside her that compels her to love someone else, someone more helpless than herself.  I highly recommend Dots as a birthday or Christmas gift for the special little girl in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNTAM58AM3W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T68PZ7K#wasThisHelpful","R3DNTAM58AM3W3","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baby Stella from Manhattan Toy is perfect for Jackie who is approximately one-and-a-half years old.  She is the daughter of Cal and Marlene who live in the condo directly across the street from my own.  They attend my church are always gracious enough to check our mail and watch our home when we are gone on vacation.  They are very familiar with the Amazon Vine Program, having lugged numerous cardboard shipping boxes across the street to their residence.  I was thinking of Jackie when I selected Baby Stella from the Amazon Vine Program.  She is the type of baby doll you would want to give to someone you love.  Jackie is a precious tyke.  She loves her Baby Stella.  It is not her first doll but she acts as though it is her first, and only, doll.  Baby Stella is absolutely adorable; she reminds me of the Cabbage Patch kids.  In the earlier eighties, I gave all of my female relatives a Cabbage Patch kid.  Most still have them.  Moms doll sits in a rocking chair, looking nostalgic.  I always enjoyed looking at the Cabbage Patch kids.  I even visited the BabyLand General Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia, where you can see them born.  There are literally hundreds of these cute Cabbage Patch Kids at this unique museum.  Jackie takes her Baby Stella everywhere she goes.  According to Marlene, the clothes have been removed, washed in cold water on delicate cycle, and air dried on clothes hangers.  The doll itself has never been put into the washing machine and shouldnt.  Marlene used a damp sponge on it.  Likewise with the pacifier which has a magnet in it.  The doll seems constructed of high-quality material.  I think Baby Stella from Manhattan Toy is the type of doll that Jackie can cherish for many years, perhaps even passing it down to her own daughter.  I highly recommend it as a birthday or Christmas present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335PVW3W13TX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLAZFKA#wasThisHelpful","R335PVW3W13TX1","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been collecting WWE action figures for several years now and have well over two-hundred in my collection.  I also own numerous play sets including four wrestling rings, a cage, two entrance stages, and a gym.  I take these out of the boxes and display them and allow children that we are babysitting to play with them, provided they are careful.  The figures are very durable.  The play sets aren't, though some benches, chairs, doors, etc., are made to be ""breakable.""  I was excited when the Amazon Vine Program offered me two figures, Bray Wyatt and John Cena, from the collection of WWE Create a Superstar.  John Cena is dressed like a marine.  I was able to easily put him together.  His limbs and head snap in and out easily.  In fact, without any trouble, I exchanged his torso for that of the more muscular Bray Wyatt.  Earlier, I had noticed that the WWE Create a Superstar John Cena was taller than the other WWE John Cenas in my personal collection.  The helmet fit John Cena's head easily and fit the heads of other WWE figures.  The vest was more difficult to put on.  The back straps are tricky. I had to be very careful.  I am concerned that the straps will break with repeated usage.  It is my suggestion that you find a figure for modeling this vest and keep it on him for as long as possible.  I put the helmet and vest on a John Cena figure that had camouflage pants.  They looked good together.  I might keep it that way.  I also put an American flag in this patriot's hand.  The accessories alone are worth the price of the WWE Create a Superstar figure.  The accessories can be used on numerous WWE figures.  The vest fits well on many of the figures since John Cena is relatively a large wrestler.  His helmet was a different story.  It only fit on those action figures that didn't have much hair.  For example, both the vest and helmet looked good on my Skip Sheffield figure because he is bald and very muscular.  Nevertheless, the WWE Create a Superstar John Cena is a must have for fans of John Cena and collectors, both young and old, of WWE figures.  One can purchase numerous Create a Superstar packs and exchange body parts and accessories, creating a WWE universe that is only limited by ones imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB51LKD9OBPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RX9VWVC#wasThisHelpful","R2OB51LKD9OBPG","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid collector of WWE figurines.  I have over two-hundred in my personal collection.  They are all out of their boxes.  I have no intention of reselling them.  I let young friends play with them.  Ryan, whom my girlfriend, Tammy, and I often babysit, loves to play with them.  He has been instructed not to be rough with them.  They are, however, difficult to destroy.  The WWE Create a Superstar figures remind me very much of the WWE Elite figures because they are very flexible.  They can do the splits.  The arms, legs and feet of the WWE Create a Superstar figures can easily be removed, but they can easily be reattached.  This is to allow them to be more interchangeable with each other.  I am most fortunate that the Amazon Vine Program has allowed me the opportunity to review two of the WWE Create a Superstar figures.  (I would love to review more.)  I have the Bray Wyatt and the most popular John Cena.  Bray Wyatt has his own brown blacksmith apron and a white phantom mask.  He also came with a sheet of tattoos that are intended only for the figure and his accessories.  I dont like tattoos.  They are hard to apply and remove.  I think they are distracting.  I have no intention of applying them.  However, I kept the sheet in case I change my mind or do decide to give the figure away, which I probably wont.  I was easily able to assemble the Bray Wyatt figure.  Easy-to-read and easy-to-follow directions came in the box.  (They were located on the very bottom of the box; you may not see them at first when you open the package.)  I put the apron and the mask on the figure.  I had to remove Bray Wyatts head in order to put the apron on because he has a big head with so much hair.  The apron snaps closed in the back.  Be careful not to ruin it.  The apron and the mask can be put on other WWE figures that are not associated with the line of WWE Create a Superstar figures.  The apron also looks good on the more masculine figures such as Ryan Mason, Skip Sheffield and Triple H.  The phantom mask gives some figures a creepy, sinister look as if they are a serial killer from a slasher flick.  Famous WWE wrestler Kane has starred in See No Evil and See No Evil 2.  The accessories alone are worth the price of the figure.  They can be expensive when ordering them from online stores that sell wresting figurines and accessories.  (Actually, I havent seen anything similar to the apron or mask sold individually on any site.)  Furthermore, for a different look, I also swapped Bray Wyatts torso with John Cenas torso with no difficulty.  I highly recommend these figures from WWE Create a Superstar as toys for children or action figures for avid collectors.  One can use them to create their very own unique, personalized wrestler.  The combinations are as endless as ones own imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IS30JJICJVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RX9VH80#wasThisHelpful","R5IS30JJICJVY","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cousin, Gianna, and her infant daughter, Danielle, live with my girlfriend, Tammy, and I.  Gianna said the TL Care Organic Cotton Mittens were cute and adorable.  She put them on Danielles hands.  Danielle is nearly three months old.  The gloves fit her fine.  They probably would have been loose fitting if she was a newborn.  There are no strings or cords to tighten the mittens around the babys hands.  However, I think Danielle will be able to wear them through the fall and into the winter.  If not, I have a friend, Andrea, at work who will be giving birth to a boy in late December, early January.  Perhaps her child can wear them then.  Two 100% cotton mittens came in a single package and they are extremely soft and comfortable.  Because they are not heavily dyed, Danielle shouldnt have any allergic reactions to them.  The colors are what I call gender friendly; either male or female can wear them.  (Honestly, I wouldnt want my baby son to wear hot pink mittens.)  Earth colors are the best.  Also, Danielle vomited on one of the gloves while Tammy and I were babysitting her.  I quickly washed the mittens on delicate cycle in cold water and hung them up to dry.  They turned out fine, looking nearly as new as when I took them out of their package.  The TL Care Organic Cotton Mittens would make a unique, affordable baby shower gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7G8OPO43G2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H36ZZA#wasThisHelpful","RS7G8OPO43G2D","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American Baby Company Organic Fitted Cotton Velour Crib Sheet is a comfortable, cotton-rich sheet that fits the standard size crib sitting in the corner of my office.  Gianna, my niece, along with her entire family, recently moved into my three-story condo.  Her daughter, Danielle, is practically a newborn and sleeps in this crib.  The mocha color of the crib sheet is an attractive earth color and coordinates well with practically any nursery dcor.  The nursery (for right now) just happens to be my office.  Caring for the sheet is easy.  I simply washed it on delicate cycle in cold water, using the most inexpensive liquid detergent that I could find.  (Dont use bleach.)  I dried in in the dryer on low heat.  I would have preferred to hang it on a clothesline like my mom would have done but who uses those these days?  Even after washing it, we had no trouble putting it on the standard size mattress.  It was a tight fit but it is supposed to be tight.

"The Fisher-Price Froggy Potty is absolutely adorable.  Originally, I had planned to give it to my girlfriends niece, Theresa, who has a baby girl, Claire.  Unfortunately, Theresa and Claire will soon be moving to Galveston, Texas, and Claire is too young for toilet training.  Recently, the married couple next door to me, Kyle and Jeff, told me they were attempting to toilet train their two-year-old adopted son, Aaron.  Their potty is an old metal contraption that looks quite old; they purchased it from a local thrift store.  Tammy, my girlfriend, and I gave Kyle and Jeff the Fisher-Price Froggy Potty.  Aaron was fascinated by it.  He was hesitant about sitting on the old metal contraption, but he was drawn to the Froggy Potty.  In fact, Kyle tells me that Aaron will sit on it while holding his plush giraffe.  Kyle also informed me that the pot is easy to lift out and clean before resetting it.  I highly recommend the Fisher-Price Froggy Potty; it would make a great present for young parents whose children are between the ages of 22 to 30 months and are physically capable of being toilet trained.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JM3GMFBESGNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBYNN6Y#wasThisHelpful","R3JM3GMFBESGNY","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this Wrangler Mens Authentics Short-Sleeve Classic Woven Shirt.  I wear large T-shirts, polos, henleys, etc., and this short-sleeve shirt fit me perfectly.  It felt as though it was tailor-made for my physique.  I am a 52-year-old, nonathletic Caucasian male who stands barely 5 8 and weighs approximately 180 pounds.  (Im pudgy.)  The shirt is comfortable around my shoulders and arms; there is ample room for me to move them around; I dont feel as though I am in bondage because the shirt is too tight.  Also, the shirt hangs well around my bulging paunch.  The shirt is not fitted for athletically built men.  It is for the everyday guy.  Ive worn it to church and work and received compliments.  My coworker, Eric, laughed and said, Youre dressed like a GS-15.  (A GS-15 is a department supervisor who normally makes over $100,000 a year.)  I usually wear novelty T-shirts such as Hard Rock Caf or Life is Good.  This Wrangler shirt is burgundy, which is my favorite color.  Every car Ive owned has been burgundy.  I have quite a few burgundy shirts.  The Wrangler shirt coordinates well with my dark blue jeans and my black jeans.  I wore it to my church where we dress casually.  It looks great with a black T-shirt underneath it.  I wear it outside my jeans for a more relaxed look.  I wore the shirt right out of the package in which it was shipped.  It didnt need ironing.  Later, after wearing it to church, I washed it in cold water on delicate cycle.  Then I hung it up to dry.  I used a warm iron to get out its few wrinkles.

The ten interchangeable cards are also easy to install and remove.  Claire enjoys lying on her back and gazing at the different shapes.  The one she gazes at the most is the baby that reminds me of the Gerber baby on the jars of baby food.  It is almost as though Claire recognizes another member of her own age group.  I wonder if there are other cards that babies stare at the most.  Does it vary from one baby to another?  These cards look as though they could be found in a psychiatrist's office--a type of Rorschach inkblot card for babies.

"Indeed, the Now Designs Homespun Dishcloths are attractive dishcloths that have an old-fashioned, nostalgic appearance.  They remind me of the ones my grandmother once crocheted and were hanging in her kitchen.  Hers however, were solid white except for thin stripes of pink and blue.  She also crocheted me sweaters.  My mom bought me a kit for crocheting potholders that is very similar to the Made by Me Weaving Loom (Made by Me Weaving Loom).  I made her dozens of potholders that remind me of these dishcloths.  The Now Designs Homespun Dishcloths are 100% cotton.  They feel great in my hands.  Upon receiving them, I immediately tossed them into the washing machine, ran the cold water, and washed them on delicate cycle.  Afterwards, I then hung them up to dry in my bathroom.  In other words, I treated them as if they were one of my crocheted sweaters, except I lay my sweaters flat on my couch in order to dry them with a minimal amount of stretching and wrinkling.  The Now Designs Homespun Dishcloths cleaned my Teflon-coated skillet without scratching it.  There were dishcloths in a set.  I used one for washing and one for drying.  They both performed well.  My only concern is their longevity.  My crocheted sweaters are easily picked; I must be careful with them.  The dishcloths arrived already picked in several places.

"My girlfriend, Tammy, loves these panties from Fruit of the Loom.  This is her first set of boyshorts.  She's always wanted to try wearing them.  Tammy found them very comfortable; they are a good fit.  She also likes the colors.  They are earth colors: black, brown, white and rose.  She swears she would never wear hot pink.  Tammy, like me, was surprised that a fabric that is extremely high in polyester could be so comfortable.  It is a new type of technology that Fruit of the Loom has employed.  My black polo shirt from Wrangler (Wrangler Men's Authentics Short Sleeve Performance Polo) is made of a breathable 100% polyester that I have found to be very comfortable and easy to care.  Tammy washed the panties in cold water on hand-wash cycle.  She hung them up in the bathroom and they quickly air dried .  She likes these Fruit of the Loom boyshorts so much that she would love to have more of them.  I'll buy her some for Christmas which is right around the corner.  Amazon, I believe, is selling them at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R323N06RTGBQLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV9SJS#wasThisHelpful","R323N06RTGBQLE","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have suffered with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C) since I was a teenager.  It is a neurological disorder that is aggravated by stress.  Certain fibrous foods, such as pineapple, help move your bowels.  Junk food contributes to constipation.  I try to consume more fruits and vegetables and foods that are high in probiotics, such as Dannon Activia yogurt.  Probiotics are essential in maintaining healthy digestion and preventing constipation.  I eat Dannon Activia yogurt every day.  However, I have found that a dietary supplement of probiotics in the form of a pill, capsule, tablet, gummi, etc., is also essential.  Recently, I've been introduced to Probiotic 10 from Vitamin World.  I live in Chesapeake, Virginia, and the nearest Vitamin World is in Hampton, about 25 miles away.  I trust Vitamin World; I have bought many products from them.  There is a Vitamin World at Foothills Mall in Maryville, Tennessee, where my parents live.  When I travel to Maryville during the holidays, I always shop there.  Probiotic 10 has ten varieties of probiotics.  The recommended dosage is two capsules; however, I only take one because I am already consuming probiotics in the form of yogurt.  (I eat two servings).  If I consume more probiotics, I might get diarrhea.  The tinted glass jar of Probiotic 10 was easy to open.  It had a protective seal.  The gelatinous capsules are medium in size and easy to swallow; they have no taste or smell.  It is recommended that they are consumed with food but I take only one before bedtime.  The expiration date is 10/16; it is printed on the side of the bottle itself and on the bottom of the cardboard box in which it was packaged.  There are 120 capsules.  This is a four-month supply for me since I will be taking only one per day.  I highly recommend taking daily probiotics and Probiotic 10 will ensure you get the proper ones.  I also recommend starting out with one per day and seeing if that will be a sufficient dosage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1W762K54I9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFOJU1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1G1W762K54I9E","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the black six-foot AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable.  I download a lot of photographs and videos to my iPhone 5S and then quickly transfer them to a SeaGate GoFlex external hard drive that is always connected to my desktop PC.  In the past, I connected a Belkin four-inch Lightning to USB Cable from my iPhone to my PC.  Consequently, the dangling iPhone barely touched the carpet in my office.  Furthermore, it was nearly impossible to perform any functions, other than touch the Trust button, on my iPhone when it was in this awkward position.  My six-foot cable from AmazonBasics makes life much easier.  I can keep my iPhone connected to my PC and perform various types of functions, such as conversing with friends and family, while data is being transferred from its memory into my external hard drive.  Also, I havent noticed data taking any longer to transfer despite the cables increased length.  My girlfriend, Tammy, calls me The Cable Guy because I own numerous cables of various lengths, colors and functions.  You can never have too many cables for connecting, charging and syncing all your electronics.  I must admit, one of my favorite is the black six-foot AmazonBasics Lightning to USB Cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22D1FO203WJI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010U3XVMU#wasThisHelpful","R22D1FO203WJI6","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest, I am not a big fan of tomatoes, unless they are cherry tomatoes.  I have never had a Bloody Mary until today.  In the past, I looked at a recipe for one and thought it was too complex to make.  I'm good at making Strawberry Daiquiris, provided that I have a mix.  Well, when the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Mr & Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix I jumped on it.  I received a four pack of 5.5 ounce cans.  The cans were much smaller than I had anticipated.  They are definitely single serving cans.  Each can only has 35 calories.  This is good since I'm on a diet; this morning, I could barely squeeze into my jean shorts.  When making the Bloody Mary, I followed directions to a T; they are labeled on the back of the can.  I took a tall hurricane glass and dumped one cup of ice (approximately 8 cubes) inside, then I measured and poured 1 ounce of Absolut vodka, and then I shook the can of Mr & Mrs T and poured it inside.  I washed and added a celery stalk and used it to stir the concoction.  The Bloody Mary was very delicious.  I love it.  It is rich with tomatoes and has a multitude of spices.  I enjoyed sipping it while reading a novel.  The vodka has put me in a great mood this Saturday morning.  I feel like dancing.  I am prepared for anything.  I am about to go to choir practice at my church down the street; we are starting to rehearse for our Christmas musical.  (Christmas will be here before you know it.)  The choir director will be wondering why I'm so happy.  I plan to order more of the Mr & Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix from Amazon.  It may be what I need to get me through the stressful holidays.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LN4JWSZ3FO9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYR57NY#wasThisHelpful","R3LN4JWSZ3FO9N","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tammy, my girlfriend, has two adorable cats, Riley and Jessie.  They aren't finicky; they will east most anything.  I wasn't surprised when they devoured the CORE Natural Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Turkey & Duck Recipe.  The Amazon Vine Program kindly sent us a two-pound bag for review.  It was easy to cut open and reseal.  When feeding the cats, we carefully followed the directions provided on the Amazon website.  The CORE cat food is very high in protein.  Most of our friends at church are cat lovers who are constantly posting photos of their beloved felines on FaceBook; they adamantly warned us that Riley and Jessie might vomit if we didn't slowly make a transition from their regular cat food to a cat food that had mostly protein.  Fortunately, the transition was easy and smooth.  The cats never became ill.  First, we printed the page from the website that depicted mixing 75% old cat food and 25% new cat food on the first and second days, 50% old cat food and 50% new cat food on the third and fourth days, etc.  We posted the page on the refrigerator and used an ink pen to mark off the days.  On the seventh day, the cats were eating 100% new food.

"Recently, my two roommates, and two of my best friends, Bill and Sue, vacated my condo.  (They are retiring to Miami.)  Now, I'm scrambling for new roommates.  I used the Bissell 1548 ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet Full-Size Carpet Cleaner to renew the beige carpet in their bedroom.  It did such a wonderful job of refreshing their carpet that I vacuumed the entire condo.  Initially, I was expecting the Bissell 1548 to be a versatile vacuum that I could use dry or wet.  It is solely a wet vacuum cleaner.  First, I had to use my Hoover WindTunnel 2 Rewind Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, UH70831PC (Hoover WindTunnel 2 Rewind Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, UH70831PC), to vacuum the carpet before using the Bissell 1548.  There are two cleaning modes: Deep Clean Mode and Express Clean Mode.  There are also a variety of Bissell formulas to use.  Bottles of Deep Clean + Antibacterial Formula and Professional Deep Cleaning Formula were included with the vacuum.  My girlfriend, Tammy, and I chose the Deep Clean Mode because our carpet hadn't been steam cleaned since I moved into my condominium over two years ago.  We also chose the Deep Clean + Antibacterial Formula because of Tammy's two cats, Riley and Jessie, that are supposed to be confined to the third floor; however, they roam throughout the building, spreading hair and bacterial everywhere.  The Bissell 1548 has two water tanks.  There is the Clean Water Tank and The Dirty Water Tank.  The Clean Water Tank reminded me of the tank on my Bissell Powerfresh Steam Mop [BISSELL Powerfresh Steam Mop, Blue, 1940A (Same as 1940)].  The tank is easy to remove and fill with HOT tap water.  It isn't necessary to use distilled water.  The Bissell cleaning formula will be added to this tank.  Simply follow the directions on the bottle to determine the amount of water and formula to add into the tank.  There is a simple switch for selecting Deep Cleaning or Express Cleaning.  The Bissell 1548 is a heavy vacuum cleaner.  It is not intended for the elderly and infirm.  The greatest difficulty I experienced was in maneuvering it up and down the carpeted steps between my condo's floors.  The cord was plenty long.  While I pushed the vacuum, used water was transferred to the Dirty Water Tank.  The Dirty Water Tank surprised me.  The water was very cloudy.  I didn't realize my carpet was that filthy.  Even though it looked clean, it wasn't.  Also, the tanks are small.  I had to empty them several times before the entire condo had been wet vacuumed.  In Deep Clean Mode, our carpet took a long time to dry.  It wasn't until the next morning that we could really walk on it without our socks becoming soggy.  From now on, we'll use the Express Clean Mode.  The attachments did a great job of removing cat hair from couches and chairs in the den.  The cats love to snuggle on this furniture when we are not around.  Upon coming home from work, Tammy or I will catch them sleeping on the furniture.  They will awake, jump off the furniture and dash up the stairs.  When the carpet was wet, they were afraid to leave the third floor bathroom and venture downstairs.  As I stated earlier, the Bissell 1548 Wet Vacuum Cleaner did a great job of refreshing my carpet.  However, there were some stains in Sue and Bill's bedroom that could not be removed.  These were near the area where the dresser had been sitting and in the walk-in closet.  No matter how many times I ran my vacuum over them, the stains would not go away.  Fortunately, I am a realistic person and don't expect miracles.  Overall, the vacuum cleaner did a great job.  I would have had to pay nearly two hundred dollars for professional cleaners.  (That is why I never had my carpets steam cleaned--too expensive.)  For home use, I highly recommend the Bissell 1548.  It will pay for itself after the first few times of using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327GJTQAN703V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R327GJTQAN703V","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite styling gel is Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel from Matrix [BIOLAGE by Matrix GELEE FIRM HOLD GEL 16.9 OZ ( Package Of 4 )].  For Christmas, Mom always gives me a large 16.9 ounce bottle; she buys it from the hair salon located inside a department store at Foothills Mall in Maryville, Tennessee.  She must wait until it is on sale because Matrix products are expensive.  Recently, the Amazon Vine Program offered me Suave Professionals Sculpting Gel, Firm Control, 7 ounces.  The Suave gel works just as well as the Biolage gel but is less expensive.  Normally, my light-brown hair is very straight, thin, fine, and unmanageable.  Thankfully, the Suave gel leaves my hair feeling soft and fluffy and it holds my simple style.  A little dab goes a long way.  Also, the gel is clear in color and virtually odorless.  I simply use my fingertips to spread it throughout my wet, freshly washed hair.  Then I comb and blow dry it.  In the past, I have used many Suave products.  They range from bottles of 2-in-1 shampoo + conditioner to body lotions.  Suave products generally work as well as their more expensive counterparts.  I plan to introduce Mom to the Suave Professionals Sculpting Gel, Firm Control.  It works as well as the Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel from Matrix.

"I played with Legos and Lincoln Logs when I was a child.  I probably played with them for too many years.  I enjoyed creating large buses, buildings and boats and then destroying them as though they were props in a disaster film such as Earthquake, The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure (1972).  Receiving the Green Toys Block Set brought back a lot of good memories from my childhood.  Before allowing my neighbor child, Ryan, to play with the blocks, my girlfriend, Tammy, and I played with them.  We created a game where we took turns buiding something tall and spectacular within one minute.  We had to use all eighteen pieces.  We would take photos of our structures with our iPhones and judge who had the best creation.  I won because I have the greatest (or most warped) imagination.  The Green Toys Block Set came with all eighteen blocks.  However, the colors were different from the ones on Amazons website.  I suppose the multi in the product title means that the blocks arrive in a multitude of bright, carnival-like colors.  For example, our two triangular blocks were green whereas the ones on the website are yellow.  Our four largest blocks were yellow, whereas the ones on the website are blue.  It is true that the blocks dont fit tightly together.  This is to prevent small toddlers from straining and pulling to get them free.  You dont want children hurting themselves.  The blocks will fit together, but not tightly.  The blocks themselves are so huge that they would be impossible for a baby to swallow.  I feel comfortable leaving them in the presence of a baby.  We plan on allowing Tammys infant grandniece, Claire, to play with them when shes older.  Our neighbor child, Ryan, who is approximately three, played eagerly with them.  I think, however, he would have liked to have had more blocks.  Eighteen wasnt enough.  When he gets older, hell definitely want more.  I highly recommend the Green Toys Block Set.  The blocks are made of 100% recycled plastic and will safely introduce children to the world of creative blocks.

"I've loved all of the Axe Products, especially the ones from the Shampoo + Conditioner line.  I only use bottles of Shampoo + Conditioner.  In the mornings, I am in a perpetual rush to get to work.  (If I don't arrive by 6:30, I don't get a parking space and must park outside the shipyard where I work.)  I don't have time to mentally debate with myself over whether or not I used conditioner the previous day.  I use conditioner every day; my hair will become very greasy if I don't.  With the Apollo, as with most all of the Axe Products, a little bit goes a long way.  I try not to squeeze too much of the blue liquid from the bottle.  It is very easy to do if I am in a hurry.  It lathers very well.  This is a major complaint from men who use a Shampoo + Conditioner product--it doesn't lather well.  However, Apollo does.  It also has a light, masculine scent that is very subtle.  I never smell it in my hair.  It quickly dissipates during the rinsing.  The Apollo cleans my hair, leaving it light and fluffy.  How do I know when my hair is clean?  When I don't feel it.  It is as though I'm bald.  I have to shake my head to feel it against my neck.  When I rub my hand through it, my light-brown hair feels silky soft.  Also, my hair is easy to style with gel.  It remains clean throughout the day and into the night.

"Honestly, I would have never chosen the Wrangler Mens Authentic Short Sleeve Performance Polo if I had known it was 100% polyester.  I stopped buying polyester over twenty-five years ago.  It makes me itch.  It doesnt breathe.  Yes, there are some advantages.  Polyester doesnt shrink when accidentally washed in warm water and doesnt need ironing.  I soon learned that this polo from Wrangler is different.  Besides being attractive and fitting well on me, it feels very comfortable.  It has moisture wicking technology that keeps you cool and dry.  It acts like cotton in that it breathes and absorbs sweat.  The next day after it arrived, I wore it with dark blue denim jeans to church, where we dress casually.  That night, I turned the polo inside out and washed it in cold water on hand wash cycle.

"It is 1796 and Will Rees, a traveling weaver, is in Salem, Massachusetts; he is buying cloth for his pregnant wife, Lydia.  Rees has a chance encounter with a fellow war veteran, Stephen ""Twig"" Eaton, who is a mortician.  At Twig's request, Will attends the wake for the wife of a wealthy maritime merchant, Jacob Boothe.  The next morning, while traveling home in his buggy, Rees is halted by a frantic Twig who informs him that Jacob has been murdered.  The tragedy has been compounded by the arrest of Twig's fiance, Xenobia, a slave of Jamaican descent. While searching for the true killer, Rees discovers that the Boothe family has many dark secrets--secrets that will cause more deaths in Salem.  An extremely dysfunctional family is the center of Eleanor Kuhn's latest Will Rees novel, ""Death in Salem"" [following ""Cradle to Grave"" (Cradle to Grave (Will Rees Mysteries)) and ""Death of a Dyer"" (Death of a Dyer (Will Rees Mysteries))].  Before her death, Anstiss Booth, the matriarch of the Boothe family, was kept in seclusion, her body wracked with pain; her husband, Jacob, denied her the opium she needed.  The children are spoiled.  Peggy, the youngest daughter, wishes she were a man so she could run the family business.  Her brother, William, is power hungry.  The other son, Michael, a playboy, wants to be an actor.  The oldest daughter, Betsy, wishes only to marry a wealthy gentleman, but too many family scandals may prevent this.  Also, it is rumored that Jacob Boothe was having an affair.  Salem is a strange city rich with history.  Superstition and suspicion still reign more than one-hundred years after the infamous witch trials.  Taverns have names such as Moon and Stars and Witch's Cauldron.  There is a bordello named The Black Cat.  A myriad of dark tunnels lie beneath the city.  These tunnels connect homes with warehouses, taverns and bordellos; they aid with smuggling and other illicit activities, including adulterous trysts.  Rees's life is jeopardized when he pursues a murder suspect into the tunnels.  There is a lot of tension whenever Rees travels beneath the city.  Rees's life, it appears, is in constant danger as long as he searches for an elusive killer.  To make matters worse, his pregnant wife, Lydia, comes to Salem to aid him with his investigation.  She serves as his sounding board.  I constantly feared for the safety of her and her baby.  In the last novel, ""Cradle to Grave,"" Rees and Lydia adopted five orphans.  Rees has a fourteen-year-old son, David, from a previous marriage; David resents his father adopting more children.  Father and son don't speak.  It appears that Rees is in Salem partially to get a break from a family that has become overwhelming.  Furthermore, his sister, Caroline, is still causing grief for him.  Indeed, Rees encounters family problems and more family problems.  Rees can't escape them, whether they are his own or those of another.  He even meets a little girl, Annie, who wishes to leave her mom, One-Eye Mary, who is the madam at The Black Cat.  Annie wants to live in the Shaker community where Lydia once lived before marrying Rees.  Also, Rees gives advice to a young lad, Billy Baldwin, the same age as David, who dreams of working on a merchant ship.  Rees has a kind, generous heart.  He makes an admirable detective.  The mystery in ""Death in Salem"" is a complex one.  I didn't know the identity of Jacob Boothe's killer until nearly the very end.  Neither did Rees.  I almost felt as though he was adlibbing when he had gathered all the many suspects together, a la Lieutenant Columbo, and announced the killer at the end of a lengthy dialogue.  A complex mystery, coupled with a large assortment of strange characters (one of which is the extremely effeminate, foppish Deputy Sheriff Swett), a creepy setting, gruesome murders, and a lot of emotional drama, makes this novel a must read for fans of historical whodunits.  I love stepping back in time with best-selling author Eleanor Kuhns.  I can't wait to read the next novel and hope Rees spends more time with his brood of adorable children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHCJJVDBREUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067022#wasThisHelpful","R1EHCJJVDBREUE","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two young Christian graduates of Georgia's Pentecost University, Samantha Boggs and Missy Montgomery, have disappeared while hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) in the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  The Place Last Seen (PLS) was established at a Chairback Mountain lean-to shelter near Monson, Maine.  Game Warden Mike Bowditch and his girlfriend, Stacy Stephens, a biologist, have joined the massive search party.  There are numerous ways to die in the forest.  Are Samantha and Missy the victims of a hate crime committed by local rednecks?  Did they fall prey to a serial killer who stalks hapless hikers on the AT?  Could they have been savagely torn apart by rogue coyotes?  Or are they merely the victims of an accident that occurred when they stepped too close to the precipice of a cliff?  Mike and Stacey put their lives in danger on numerous occasions as they search for the truth.  ""The Precipice"" is the most disturbing, most nerve-wracking of all of Paul Doiron's Mike Bowditch novels.  It has been three days since I've read it and I still get nervous thinking about the plot.  Having grown up in Blount County, Tennessee, at the foot of the Smoky Mountains National Park, I have gone hiking on numerous occasions with the Boy Scouts and Sunday school classes.  Becoming lost in the woods has always been a genuine fear of mine.  I never stray off the designated hiking trails.  One could stumble across wild bears, boars, or wolves or someone's marijuana patch.  (I've also seen a lot of horror movies about cannibalistic hillbilly mutants.)  According to ""The Precipice,"" every year 500 people are reported missing in Maine. Within 48 hours, most are found.  After that, the odds of them ever being found alive grow slimmer as time passes.  In the Hundred Mile Wilderness, if the mosquitoes don't eat you alive, something else will.  As I strongly suspected, ""The Precipice"" was a fast-paced novel with numerous shocks and grisly discoveries.  The body count was high enough to keep gore hounds, like myself, satisfied.  The disappearance of Samantha and Missy is just one of several intertwining plots that are extremely fascinating.  Whoever, or whatever, is responsible for their disappearance remains a well-guarded mystery until nearly the very end.  Unusual characters abound.  You encounter all kinds of hikers on the AT that range from very nice to very weird. All of them have pseudonyms such as Incredible Hunk, McDonut and El Chupacabra. The reader receives a crash course on hiking the AT.  For example, I didn't realize there were so many lodges, lean-tos, and shelters that hikers could sleep in.  Paul Doiron describes an exciting and beautiful, but dangerous, world that makes me want to grab my boots and commence hiking.  ""The Precipice"" couldn't have been published at a more opportune time.  Thanks to President Barack Obama, the Confederate flags are coming down and the rainbow flags are going up.  This novel deals with the sensitive issue of homosexuality. Readers already know that Mike Bowditch's girlfriend, Stacey Stephens, is bisexual.  There are characters who believe that homosexuality is a sin.  One of them is the gaudy, obnoxious Reverend Mott who represents the parents of the missing hikers.  Paul Doiron is one of those extremely gifted writers who can blend timely, real-life news stories with a unique setting and interesting, realistic characters.  The Maine wilderness to a city boy like me is a foreign country.  Furthermore, Mike Bowditch is an incredibly likeable protagonist whom I truly admire.  He has his flaws, but don't we all?  He's an agnostic and I'm a devout Christian.  However, I can understand when he says, ""My prayers rarely come true.""  In a world full of tragedy, it can be difficult to keep one's faith.  I have faith that Paul Doiron's next Mike Bowditch novel will be another bestseller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWL0B9YVXGOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250063698#wasThisHelpful","R2XWL0B9YVXGOO","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rescued dog, Cheyenne, has been stolen from the Tara Foundation.  Thanks to a GPS chip implanted in her collar, defense lawyer Andy Carpenter traces Cheyenne to a house where her abductor, Gerald Downey, is found with his head nearly severed from his body.  Tommy Infante is arrested for the murder.  Someone planted the bloody murder weapon in his backyard.  During his investigation to free Infante, Carpenter learns that the victim is just one of several men who have been viciously executed because of a conspiracy involving stolen diamonds.  Soon Carpenter and his whacky staff will become the next targets of a ruthless assassin.  In his latest novel, ""Who Let the Dog Out?"", David Rosenfelt has once again created an over-the-top thriller involving a dog and the threat to thousands of American lives.  A heinous murder grabs the reader.  Additional murders, committed by a ruthless assassin, Aleksandre, ensure a fast-paced plot.  Most of the novel, however, involves a trial in which Carpenter attempts to perform the impossible:  Have Tommy Infante declared innocent even though the evidence against him is overwhelming.  Carpenter, with his glib, witty, smart-alecky humor, always seems to outsmart the prosecuting attorney.  This time around, it is one of his oldest nemeses, Dylan Campbell--a crooked lawyer who has his sights set on a future career in politics.  At the beginning of ""Who Let the Dog Out?"", Carpenter has already married his long-term girlfriend, Laurie Collins, who is an ex-police officer.  He has also adopted Ricky Diaz; this adorable, nine-year-old boy was orphaned in the previous novel, ""Hounded.""  Ricky's basset hound, Sebastian, has become a playful companion to Carpenter's golden retriever, Tara.  Carpenter is much happier now that he has a family.  Despite being a wiseass, he is a very likeable protagonist.  In all fairness, he belittles himself as much as other people.  One example of Carpenter's humor is when he is introduced to two FBI employees, Agent Hernandez and Agent Gardiner:  ""Both of your first names are Agent?  Wow, what are the odds against that?""  Even though he is a wiz in the courtroom, Carpenter would be floundering if not for his excellent staff.  Sam Willis is an expert computer hacker who is able to find hidden records on the internet.  Hike Lynch is a great assistant lawyer, but his manic depressant persona could permanently erase the huge smile on Pastor Joel Osteen's face.  Marcus is Carpenter's hired muscle; he is a large Neanderthal who listens to classical music, only grunts when spoken to, and moves faster than lightning.  He has saved Carpenter's life on more than one occasion.  After nearly thirty years working in the Federal Government, I have learned that a supervisor is only as good as their employees.  I was disappointed that more of the novel wasn't set in Maine.  Readers soon learn there is a group of terrorists concealing themselves in a remote area of Maine, primarily an island, Ashby, which is connected to the mainland by only one bridge.  A fan of Paul Doiron's Mike Bowditch mysteries, I have learned to love the Maine wilderness with its beauty and danger.  However, most of David Rosenfelt's latest novel takes place in a courtroom in Paterson, New Jersey.  The trial's outcome, however, has far more outreaching consequences other than whether or not an innocent man goes to prison.  With its zany, but lovable, characters; gruesome deaths; and intriguing plot involving stolen diamonds, ""Who Let the Dog Out?"" is a great installment in the Alex Carpenter series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMRF0ERDU0EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055334#wasThisHelpful","RJMRF0ERDU0EI","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goodbye summer; hello fall.  I love everything pumpkin, especially pumpkin bread, Pumpkin Pop Tarts, and pumpkin spice coffee.  Normally, I buy the type of Pumpkin Spice Coffee-mate Coffee Creamer that needs refrigeration.  I prefer the refrigerated variety over the non-dairy powder or the liquid creamer singles, both of which don't need refrigeration.  I was thrilled to receive for review the Pumpkin Spice Coffee-mate Coffee Creamer Table-Top Pump Bottle.  The table-top pump bottle arrived well packaged.  The bottle and the pump were separate from each other.  I had to rip open a transparent blue bag and take out the red pump; it was easy to install.  Simply remove the cap and seal from the bottle and screw on the red pump.  The pump will have to be pressed a few times before it begins dispensing the creamer in measured amounts.  I learned from trial and error that I only need two pumps.  Three pumps are too much and one isn't enough to sweeten my coffee.  Each pump is equivalent to one liquid creamer single.  Normally, I use two liquid creamer singles in my coffee.  If I use the creamer, I don't need to add sugar.  Some people do.  I purchased several boxes of Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K-Cups.  I have a basic model of Keurig.  I brewed the Pumpkin Spice Coffee and added two servings of the Pumpkin Spice liquid creamer from the pump.  The resulting coffee was absolutely delicious.  It was like gourmet pumpkin spice coffee from a coffee shop.  I took the table-top pump bottle to work and shared it with my coworker, Eric.  He also enjoyed the pumpkin spice creamer.  We're both big coffee drinkers.  We both own a Keurig, though his is more sophisticated than mine.  The Pumpkin Spice Coffee Creamer Table-Top Pump from Coffee-mate is highly recommended for lovers of holiday coffee.  As I stated, fall is right around the corner and you will want to stock up on this creamer before it vanishes forever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65RL10SCP3RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCXT8BI#wasThisHelpful","R65RL10SCP3RX","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took the Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Adhesive Lighted Mirror, Hollywood Pink, E6337, to my office space at work.  I decided to attach it to a top shelf of a metal storage cabinet in my research room, which is adjacent to my work station.  I carefully followed the easy-to-read instructions on the back of the package.  First, I used a wet paper towel and a dry one to thoroughly clean the area where I wanted to hang the mirror.  The filing cabinet, like the rest of my office, is less than a year old.  It was not filthy dirty.  If it had been, I would have cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol; it is a safe cleaning solvent that many use to wipe their walls before mounting various wall hangings with adhesive backings.  I was disappointed that the package back wasn't perforated like the one for the Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Micro Suction Technology Catch All Cup (Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Micro Suction Technology Catch All Cup, Clear, E6349).  I wanted to save the packaging for storing the adhesive disc.  I used a pair of scissors and carefully cut across the packaging approximately one-inch above the plastic bubble in which the lighted mirror is stored.  After making the incision, I carefully pried the cardboard away from the plastic and removed the lighted mirror and the release liner/adhesive disc.  I carefully peeled the adhesive disc from the release liner.  I stored the release liner inside the packaging, sealing it shut with about four paperclips.  I firmly pressed the adhesive disc onto the top shelf of the metal filing cabinet, making sure the arrow was pointed upward.  I tried to remove as many air bubbles as possible.  According to the instructions, it is best to allow the adhesive disc to remain affixed to the surface at least one hour before applying the mirror.  I let the disc remain attached to the shelf overnight.  Meanwhile, I opened the mirror and inserted the three AAA batteries which were not included.  Fortunately, I already had a fresh pack of eight which I brought to work with me.  The compartment housing the batteries is slightly flimsy.  I had to be careful when opening and closing it not to break the door or the tabs.  It takes some patience and gentleness.  I didn't experience any trouble attaching the mirror.  I turned out the lights in my tiny research room and turned on the mirror.  It shone beautifully in the room, reminding me of a seventies disco.  ""This is my party room,"" I told some of my coworkers.  They laughed.  A week later, I had no difficulty transferring the mirror from one cabinet to another.  I simply removed the mirror, gently peeled off the adhesive disc, attached the adhesive disc to its release liner, cleaned the new area, reattached the adhesive disc, waited overnight, and then reattached the mirror.  The mirror hasn't fallen and everyone seems to like it.  The lights are bright and I can see all the blemishes on my face.  I highly recommend the Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Adhesive Lighted Mirror, Hollywood Pink, E6337, to anyone who has a locker, office cubicle, or private home/work office.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EJM6GDSDLYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G94SK#wasThisHelpful","R26EJM6GDSDLYO","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took the Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Micro Suction Technology Catch All Cup to my work office.  I chose to hang it on a storage shelf located directly above my desk top computer.  The shelf has a simulated wood cover that I always keep down.  The simulated wood is a smooth, flat surface.  After deciding to place it near the left-hand side, I thoroughly wiped the surface clean with a wet paper towel and then dried it with another paper towel.  My work station, I must admit, is only about a year old.  Therefore, it isn't filthy dirty.  If it was, I would've wiped the shelf clean with isopropyl alcohol; it is a safe cleaning solvent that many use to wipe their walls before mounting various wall hangings with adhesive backings.  The back of the package has a perforation that makes it easy to open, reach inside and remove the release liner/adhesive square.  This prevents damaging the package, which I can save for storing the release liner.  I gently peeled the adhesive square from the release liner and firmly stuck it to the wall, smoothing out as many air bubbles as possible.  The instructions say to allow it to adhere to the wall at least one hour before attaching the catch all cup.  I actually waited until the next morning before attaching it.  The cup held firmly to the wall.  The cup is smaller than I had imagined.  It only holds about seven or eight pens.  I review/edit administrative instructions and use a lot of red ink.  I put a bunch of red pens in this cup.  Their sole purpose is to edit my work.  A few days after initially hanging the cup on my shelf, I decided to move it to its right side.  This was easy.  I detached the cup and gently peeled the adhesive square off the fake wood.  There was no sticky residue of any kind that remained stuck to the fake wood.  It came off neatly.  I placed the adhesive square back onto its protective release liner that I had kept inside the package.  Then I followed the procedure above in order to hang the catch-all cup on the right side of my shelf.  I didn't have any problems in re-hanging the cup.  That was a week ago and it hasn't fallen down onto my worktable.  I recommend the Elmer's Freestyle Repositionable Micro Suction Technology Catch All Cup for any office work station, dorm room, or locker.  It would make a wonderful stocking stuffer for the student or office employee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116Q43Q4X19ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G94G2#wasThisHelpful","R116Q43Q4X19ES","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently, I received the Omron 7 Series Wireless Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor (Model BP654).  It makes monitoring and sharing my blood pressure convenient and fun.  First of all, it is very compact.  I can take it with me anywhere I go such as work, church, vacation, etc.  Recently, I carried it to work and monitored my coworkers' blood pressures.  Most of my coworkers are female and are approximately my age.  The ones who were already on blood pressure medication had normal readings.  Those who weren't had borderline high readings that read somewhere around 135/91.  Now, my parents are worried about me.  I made the mistake of e-mailing my results to them via the Omron Wellness App that I downloaded to my Apple iPhone 5S.  I don't consider myself a tech savvy person, even though some of my friends and coworkers believe I am.  I simply read instructions.  The Omron instruction manual is easy to read and follow; it has a multitude of helpful instructions.  The manual is a fold-out pamphlet that one must re-fold like a map.  I wish it had been more like an actual multi-page booklet with staples.  The fold-out pamphlet won't endure many years of usage.  The Omron BP654 was easy to use.  At first, I received a few E5 errors, which meant that the cuff was not applied correctly.  However, these E5 errors soon vanished.  The orange position indicator still flashes sometimes, requesting me to lower or raise my outstretched hand.  I have not disabled this function.  The Omron BP654 requires 2 AA batteries, which came with the device.  They were relatively simple to install; no miniscule screwdriver is required.  The cuff wraps easily around my wrist.  I apply it comfortably about one-half inch below my upturned palm and just below my joint bone knob which sticks out quite a bit for me.  (In order to correctly monitor one's readings, it is imperative that one set the date and time.)  After pushing the Start/Stop button, one can feel the cuff tighten up around their wrist.  Initially, my readings were high because I was nervous about using the Omron BP654.  Afterwards, my readings settled down.  My blood pressure, as I stated earlier, is in the normal range but it floats around the border between normal and high.  I am not too concerned.  However, I realize I need to exercise more and eat more fresh foods instead of processed ones.  One should take three consecutive measurements within a ten minute period and average them.  The machine will do this for you.  Simply turn off the machine and press and hold the memory button for more than two seconds.  Also, measurements should be taken throughout the day.  You should wait thirty minutes after waking up, eating, bathing, and exercising.  Try to remain calm and relaxed and don't speak while the Omron BP654 is taking measurements.  I always try to imagine myself lying on a tropical beach.  I can hear the waves lapping against the shore, the sun is warming my flesh and the sea gulls are crying overhead.  Downloading the Omron Wellness App to my iPhone 5S was easy.  Simply go to the App Store and search for ""Omron Wellness.""  The App is free and establishing an account is simple.  Your e-mail and a password are required.  No Social Security Number or home address or home telephone number.  Directions for pairing the iPhone 5s with the Omron BP654 are easy.  Make sure the Omron BP654 is off when pairing and transferring data.  Tiny bubbles will appear on my Omron BP654 when data is being transferred from the blood pressure kit to the iPhone.  You can choose which data to e-mail to yourself, a friend, a family member or a physician.  The Omron BP654 is intended to be used by only one person.  Two people could use my Omron 10 Plus Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff Model BP791IT (Omron 10 Plus Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff).  However, the Omron BP791IT is huge and bulky, it requires four AA batteries, it could only transfer data to a personal computer via a USB cord, and it gave me more error messages.  The cuff on the Omron BP791IT was more difficult to wrap around my biceps.  On the other hand, the Omron BP791IT could store up to two-hundred blood pressure readings.  The Omron BP654 can only store one-hundred.  The readings from both machines are approximately the same.  Both give good results.  One reason the Omron BP654 is easy to take with you when you go to work, church, and the gym and travel on vacation, etc., is because it has its own hard plastic, protective case.  The device fits securely within the case.  The case is not padded; therefore, it won't provide much protection to the Omron BP654 if it is dropped from a great height.  The device can easily be put into one's backpack, purse, luggage, etc.  I carry mine with me in my backpack.  The case has a snap latch that is easy to open and close.  There are plastic coated cards inside that illustrate the proper positioning of one's arm when recording one's blood pressure.  I wished the instruction manual or quick start guide would fit inside but they don't.  Data can be easily erased from the Omron BP654.  Unfortunately, it is either ALL or nothing.  Certain measurements cannot be deleted.  For example, when I was taking the blood pressure of coworkers, I could not delete their measurements in order to prevent them from contaminating mine.  When data is transferred to the Omron Wellness App, it can be deleted.  However, it cannot be deleted directly from the App.  One must go to one's personal computer and log onto the Omron Wellness website.  Then they must bring up their data in a table format and selectively delete blood pressure measurements.  I did this myself.  In fact, I wiped the slate clean and started over.  I also deleted all the measurements from my Omron BP654.  I am seriously thinking about buying the Omron BP654 for my dad for Christmas.  He has high blood pressure and monitors it on a daily basis.  His blood pressure kit is an old reliable Omron but I don't know the model.  It is older than my Omron BP791IT.  Dad also has an iPad.  He could transfer data to his iPad and keep track of it for his doctor.  Someone suggested that I give him mine.  I said, ""No way.  I'm lazy.  This new Omron is so much easier to use than my old one.""  Because the Omron BP654 is easier to use and more convenient to carry and transfer data, I am more likely to continue monitoring my blood pressure on a daily basis.  This will be good for my health because it will encourage me to exercise and eat healthier in order to lower my blood pressure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZMYYVL6H018/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H76PTU#wasThisHelpful","R2BZMYYVL6H018","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I felt fortunate to receive a box containing five pouches of Peanut Butter Balance Bites.  Each pouch weighed only 1.482 Ounces.  Because it was delivered in stifling hot weather that was in the nineties, I immediately tossed the box into my freezer.  After removing a pouch from the freezer, I gently squeezed its contents, separating the soy puffs.  Each pouch of Balance Bites is easy to open; it has a notch at the top from where one can tear it.  The puffs are lightly flavored with peanut butter.  They are a delightfully crunchy, tasty snack.  I ate my first bag while watching a scary movie after dinner.  I washed them down with a glass of cold skim milk.  I shared the remaining four bags with my coworkers.  They enjoyed them.  As far as healthy is concerned, fresh fruit, or cans of fruit, would probably be just as healthy or even healthier.

"The more I age, the drier my skin becomes.  In my shower, bars of soap have been replaced with bottles of body wash.  Body washes don't dry my skin like most soaps do.  Recently, I received a bottle of Curel Itch Defense Body Wash.  It is intended for those of us, like myself, who suffer from dry skin.  I must use a body lotion every day, especially during the cold winter months, or my skin becomes dry and begins to literally itch and burn.  The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash is a luxurious body wash that I can enjoy using on a daily basis.  It's scentless, white, pearlescent liquid lathers quite well.  It comes in a bottle that is easy to grip and hold.  The bottle rests on its large top.  Therefore, the liquid is always ready to come out when opened.

The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash is also intended for those who suffer from allergies.  My girlfriend, Tammy, loves this body wash because it is scentless.  Body washes, body lotions, deodorants, etc., that are highly scented cause her skin to break out into a rash.

"I was excited to receive 5 small pouches of Chocolate Balance Bites in a box.  The box was shipped with bubble wrap inside a cardboard Amazon box.  It was 94 degrees Fahrenheit on the afternoon that I received them.  Immediately, I put the entire box in the freezer in case the chocolate coating had begun melting.  Later that evening, I fell asleep in my lounge chair while reading.  I woke up when my girlfriend, Tammy, called to tell me that her and some friends had arrived safely in New York City.  After hanging up the telephone, I was hungry.  I opened the box of Chocolate Balance Bites and grabbed a pouch.  I ate the Balance Bites with a huge glass of cold skim milk.  They are crunchy and airy with a light flavoring of chocolate.  Some of them were stuck together in clusters.  I suspect some of the chocolate had melted during shipping.  At least my fingers weren't messy because they were frozen.  One bag of the Balance Bites and the large glass of milk satisfied my hunger.  The Balance Bites are being advertised as a ""nutrition energy snack.""  However, it didn't keep me awake.  I went to bed and quickly fell asleep.  As far as being nutritious, the pouch of Balance Bites has a great deal of protein, 13 grams, but it also has a great deal of sugar, 9 grams.  It also has 0 grams of fiber.  Therefore, it wouldn't be good for those of us, like myself, who suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C).  I think a can of fruit, a banana, a bunch of grapes, or a cup of yogurt would be just as healthy as the Chocolate Balance Bites.

"Currently, the dining room table in my condominium comfortably sits six people.  However, I can add a large leaf in the middle that will allow it to sit ten.  The only time I do this is for birthday parties and holidays, mostly Thanksgiving.  (I normally leave town for Christmas.)  Unfortunately, I've never had a tablecloth that I could place over the table, until now.  The DII 100% Polyester, Machine Washable, Tonal Bordered Fabric Tablecloth is perfect for my dining room table.  It completely covers the table, with some excess.  It looks stylish and fashionable with its hemmed border that has a darker shade of brown than the remainder of the tablecloth.  It is made of 100% polyester but feels like linen.  It arrived well packaged with no flaws.  I never encountered any difficulties when I washed the tablecloth.  I washed it in cold water on hand-wash cycle.  Then I dried it on low heat.  In other words, I treated it as though it was an expensive item of delicate clothing.  I didn't need to iron it.  It came out of the drier with very few wrinkles.  I folded the table cloth and placed it in my linen closet.  I made the mistake of allowing my girlfriend, Tammy, to see the tablecloth on the dining room table.  She thought it was gorgeous.  She said we have to invite my parents and her parents over for Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately, the guest list keeps growing.  Fortunately, my roommates, Bill and Sue, will have moved to Florida by Thanksgiving and we will have more room.  Update:  Recently, I requested the white Tonal Bordered Fabric Tablecloth.  It also looks gorgeous on my dining room table.  It arrived well packaged.  I washed it in cold water on hand-wash cycle and dried in the dryer on low heat.  I didn't need to iron it.  This is a nice tablecloth that will be perfect for using all year long.  It coordinates well with most anything.  My roommates and I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NKB0S0N6P7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNVTCGQ#wasThisHelpful","R18NKB0S0N6P7O","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Five Avery Big Tab Pocket Insertable Plastic Dividers (Model # 07708) are awesome for organizing any binder.  There are many reasons why I like these dividers.  First, each one has a ""stitched,"" reinforced pocket in which I can store several sheets of paper, a brochure, or a pamphlet.  Second, the dividers are made of thick, durable plastic that is transparent; one can see pages behind it if there is not anything in the pocket that will block one's view.  Third, there are three holes punched into each divider that allows it to be easily inserted into a standard binder; these holes are reinforced to prevent the dividers from being torn out of the binders via the holes.  Fourth, each divider has a staggered tab.  When all five dividers are inserted into a binder, one can clearly see each tab.  They are not all behind each other.  Fifth, the tabs can be easily labeled.  A sheet of labels was provided.  From Avery's website, one can obtain templates for creating labels for this set of dividers.  Simply insert the model or serial number of the set into the website and perform a search.  Because I am visiting relatives, I don't have access to my Avery account (I can't remember my password) and I don't feel comfortable using my relatives' printer.  Also, there are helpful hints about printing the labels that are provided on the packaging.  Eventually, I decided to handwrite on the labels.  The labels are double sided; therefore, one can read the label whether looking at the divider from the front side or the back side.  The only thing I don't like about the dividers is the visual design.  The geometric shapes, e.g. dots, lines and triangular waves, are very bright.  They nearly hurt my eyes when I stare at them.  I wished the colors were more muted.  They need to be dulled down.  Natural colors would be easier on the eyeball.  Also, the design is more feminine than masculine.  Nevertheless, I like these binder dividers and think they would make a wonderful addition to anyone's office.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG522BYJFW3J2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2M9O98#wasThisHelpful","RG522BYJFW3J2","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avery Tabbed Snap-In Bookmark Plastic Dividers (Model #24909) have a psychedelic attractiveness if you are a fan of the nineteen seventies, which I am.  Each of the five dividers has a unique design.  (The designs, I believe, are more feminine than masculine.  Some males, like my two nephews, would not want them for their school binders; other students might harass them)  Each divider is made of hard, transparent plastic.  You will be able to see the page behind each divider.  At the top of each divider is a tab for labeling.  The set came with twenty peel-and-apply labels.  The owner can download a template from Avery's website and print the labels.  Because I am visiting relatives, I don't have my password for my Avery account and I don't want to use my relatives' printer.  Therefore, I decided to handwrite my labels.  They were easy to peel off and apply to the dividers.  Each divider has three holes punched into it, making it easy to insert into a standard notebook.  The only aspect about the dividers that made me feel uncomfortable was the ""cuts"" that have been purposely made from the edge of each divider to each hole.  This is to allow easy insertion of the divider without having to open the binder clips.  The cuts, I think, will also prevent the divider from being viciously torn from the binder if excessive force is applied to it.  However, over time, the cuts will grow wider and the dividers will more likely come out by accident.  (In fact, as I turned the dividers within the notebook, they would sometimes come out.)  I would have liked it more if the cuts were not present and the owner had to always open the binder in order to add and remove them.  Overall, I appreciate having these Avery bookmark dividers for organizing one of my dividers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XYABSRFIGNCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7HWY6G#wasThisHelpful","R2XYABSRFIGNCO","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love the Rapid Supreme Omnipress Stapler.  I'll be glad to tell you why.  First, it is heavy, like a paperweight.  I don't need to worry about easily losing it or knocking it off my office desk.  Second, it has a long, wide non-slip base which also prevents it from sliding off my desk.  Third, and extremely important, it is easy to load with staples (standard size staples will fit).  Simply grab the top, pull the top off, load staples, and shut it.  Very simple.  Very easy.  No directions necessary.  Perfect for technologically impaired people, like myself, who have difficulty reading the directions on a STOP sign.  Fourth, this sturdy, durable stapler is very ergonomic.  In other words, it is easy to hold and grip and takes very little effort to staple sheets.  I have arthritic hands and I didn't have any difficulty using this stapler.  Fifth, it can easily staple up to thirty sheets, not just a few like many of my smaller staplers.  Sixth, it staples very quietly.  Seventh, the stapler is attractive.  I received the black/gray stapler and it blends well with most of my office equipment.  I highly recommend Rapid Supreme Omnipress Stapler for any office.  It would make a thoughtful gift for anyone who owns their own personal business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1REC5AN1VI60D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPP0I3W#wasThisHelpful","R1REC5AN1VI60D","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Ryland is a reporter for the on-line newspaper edition of ""The Boston Register."" She investigates a rash of accidents and murders; women are being found dead around homes that have been foreclosed. The deaths are connected to one bank in particular, Atlantis & Anchor. Also, they are connected to a cold case involving a woman, Carley Marie Schaefer, who was found strangled to death on Lilac Sunday in 1994. The anniversary of Lilac Sunday is fast approaching. Jane Ryland may become the next victim if her and her boyfriend, Detective Jake Brogan, don't discover the identity of the Lilac Sunday Killer.Hank Phillipi Ryan's ""Truth Be Told"" [following ""The Wrong Girl"" (The Wrong Girl (Jane Ryland)) and ""The Other Woman"" (The Other Woman (Jane Ryland))] is the most intriguing of the three novels. It has a complex, realistic plot that involves a conspiracy among personnel in the banking industry. I never trusted banks before reading ""Truth Be Told."" I definitely don't trust them now. It is too easy to make money appear or disappear by pressing computer keys. In the future, I will definitely be scrutinizing my bank statements more closely. One character magically erases her clients' debts to prevent their homes from being foreclosed. Truth be told, this is not fair for those who pay their mortgages.Jane Ryland is a strong, independent single woman with moral convictions. She lives by a set of rules established for reporters. For example, never sleep with a source. She is emotionally torn about dating a police officer. If Jake and her are ever married, one of them must quit his/her job. Jake also has strong convictions. He is determined to find the true identity of the Lilac Sunday Killer; his grandfather, Police Commissioner Ewan Brogan, never could. At one point in the novel, there appears to be a love triangle. Lawyer Peter Hardesty is representing a troubled man, Gordon Thorley, who confesses to being the Lilac Sunday Killer; Peter, I believe, begins falling in love with Jane.I often think of Hank Phillipi Ryan's novels as romantic mysteries. There is a lot of sexual tension between the two leads, Jane and Jake. This is especially evident in the third novel when a competitor for Jane's affections, Peter Hardesty, is thrown into the mix. With their strong, independent heroine; intriguing, complex plots; gruesomely implied violence; and romantic touches, the Jane Ryan mysteries remind me of those written by Mary Higgins Clark. It is not surprising that Ryan has won the Mary Higgins Clark award. Furthermore, the topic of home foreclosures is a timely and sensitive one in these economically distressed times; I've had friends suffer home foreclosures.The killer's identity is kept well hidden until almost the end of ""Truth Be Told."" A good body count helps booster the pacing. However, the pacing could have been even faster if Hank Phillipi Ryan hadn't bogged it down with too much detail. In her attempt to make the characters more realistic, she reveals all their thoughts, emotions, etc. She describes common sounds. She also assumes we don't know the acronyms and jargon pertaining to basic police procedures. Ryan's over padded 400 page hardback novel could have been reduced to a more manageable 350 pages. Nevertheless, her latest novel is an enjoyable read. Because of Ryan, I'll think twice before entering an empty, abandoned house; I don't want to be murdered. Truth be told, I'm looking forward to the next Jane Ryland mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6G0B891C98W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765374935#wasThisHelpful","RW6G0B891C98W","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My girlfriend, Tammy, and I often baby sit her grandniece, Claire; she has her own portable crib in our bedroom.  Upon receiving the white fitted sheet from the American Baby Company, we washed it in cold water on delicate cycle in order to cleanse it of any chemicals that might possibly harm the baby.  Last year, a neighbor bought crib sheets from a thrift store and used them before washing; her baby had a severe allergic skin reaction to the unwashed sheets.  We never learned what chemicals had permeated the sheets.  The American Baby Company fitted sheet was washed and dried without any problems.  The sheet was nearly impossible to get on the standard size mattress, but that was fine.  You want it to be a tight fit in order for it to endure numerous washings.  I have white 100% cotton Percale fitted sheets for my queen-sized bed and they started out extremely tight--so tight they were nearly impossible to get onto my mattress.  However, over the years, they loosened up with each washing.  They still fit.  I have some sheets I've had for nearly 25 years.

"I have never used a wet skin moisturizer; I've always been a skeptic about them working on me.  I thought wet skin moisturizers would give my skin a greasy feel and I wouldn't be able to dry my skin off after applying it.  I was pleasantly surprised after using Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer.  First, let me say that it has a slight coconut scent; it is not heady or obnoxious or overbearing like the coconut scents found in some tropical suntan lotions.  The coconut scent is barely noticeable, especially after it has been applied to my skin.  Also, a little bit of the white, creamy lotion goes a long way.  The lotion is much easier to apply all over your body when your body is still wet.  I never realized this.  Duh.  After applying the lotion, I patted dry my skin with a towel.  Let me emphasize the verb ""patted.""  I patted dry my skin versus vigorously rubbed my skin dry with a towel.  Vigorously rubbing would have probably removed the lotion.  I patted dry my skin and the lotion remained on my skin; it felt nice.  My skin was smooth and moist--not sticky or tacky.  Upon receiving the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer, I couldn't wait to remove it from its sealed bag and rub a dab on my hand and wrist.  It left my skin feeling tacky and sticky.  This lotion is definitely not meant to be applied to dry skin; one must apply it to wet skin.  Also, I used the lotion all over my body, including my face.  It has not caused any allergic reactions.  You can apply it, without fear, to sensitive body parts because it is not high in alcohol.  It never once stung my skin.  Also, you can still rub other lotions, if needed, on your face; I always apply some around my eyes to lessen the appearance of wrinkles.  Also, one of the first things my girlfriend, Tammy, asked me was if the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer is intended for men or women.  I told her it was for both.  (The plastic tube-like bottle doesn't say.)  Speaking of packaging, the bottle has a bluish-gray color that is neither male nor female.  It is what I refer to as ""gender friendly.""  All sexes can use it.  The bottle doesn't scream male or female.  Also, the bottle is designed to stand on its top so that the moisturizing lotion is always at the bottom, ready to come out when it is opened.  I highly recommend the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer for those, like me, who have dry skin below the neck.  (My face is very oily but the rest of my body is dry.)  Also, this moisturizer would make a wonderful stocking stuffer for Christmas.  (I wouldn't mind receiving a bottle of Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer as a present.)  Anyone receiving this would be wonderfully surprised, especially if they have never used a wet skin moisturizer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20UE5B2L0HFM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB8843Y#wasThisHelpful","R20UE5B2L0HFM1","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For hygiene purposes, I like to get a clean dishtowel out each time I dry cookware and/or plastic ware.  I keep a separate dishtowel for drying my hands and a separate one for wiping countertops.  Consequently, I wash a lot of towels.  The DII dishtowels are made of strong, sturdy, thick 100% cotton that is easy to wash.  Upon receiving my sealed plastic bag of four DII dishtowels from the Amazon Vine Program, I immediately washed them on gentle cycle in cold water and dried them on low heat, as stated in the washing instructions printed on the tag.  However, I always wash my towels this way.  I seldom wash anything in warm or hot water because high temperatures cause stains to set in and become permanent and for colors to fade.  The DII dishtowels are thick and absorbent.  They dry very well, without leaving lint and other residue on the cookware, plastic ware, glassware, etc.  The only thing I didn't like about them was their colors.  There are four colors grouped together and labeled ""Natural.""  There is beige, bone white, olive green, and chocolate brown.  The only one that won't easily reveal stains is the chocolate brown.  Overall, the colors are a little drab for my kitchen.  I think I would have preferred the ""Classic"" collection followed by ""Warm,"" ""Primary"" and ""Bright.""  Nevertheless, DII Dishtowels are great for drying cookware, wiping hands and cleaning countertops.  They would make a great gift for holidays, birthdays, and housewarmings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8XME10BHQUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQ1O976#wasThisHelpful","R2C8XME10BHQUE","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently, I received the 3M Ultra Clear Screen Protector for the Apple iPhone 6.  Normally, I let the friendly employees at the Apple Store at MacArthur Center in Norfolk, Virginia, assist me with all my iPhone issues.  However, my girlfriend's niece, Theresa, recently bought an Apple iPhone 6 and failed to buy a screen protector.  She said they were too expensive and she didn't need one right now.  I personally installed the 3M Ultra Clear Screen Protector on Theresa's iPhone.  It came with its own cleaning cloth and cardboard for rubbing out air bubbles.  The instructions were the most concise, most explicit ones I have ever seen.  I surprised myself and was able to get it on.  It was slightly off-centered the first time but I was able to peel it off and try again with better results.  The 3M Ultra Clear Screen Protector itself appears thick and durable.  Theresa is able to work all her apps without any problems.  The screen doesn't interfere with her speed typing.  She spends more time texting than talking.

"I was absolutely shocked by the versatility of these cleaning cloths from DII.  For two weeks, I have used them all over my condominium.  In the kitchen, I used them for washing and drying dishes and as pot holders for taking cookware out of my conventional oven and microwave oven.  For the conventional oven, I made sure the cloth was folded twice before gripping it in my hand.  The cloths are very absorbent.  They are also easy to wring out and are very quick to dry.  I have also used these DII cloths to dust my bedroom and car's interior.  They pick up dust very well.  (I hadn't cleaned either one in months; I'm a slob.)  I was most surprised when I used the DII cloths as washcloths in the shower.  The material feels a little scratchy.  However, after wetting and pouring liquid soap on the cloths, they felt luxuriously soft.  I believe they do a better job of scrubbing my body than my traditional washcloths and loofah sponges.  The DII cloths have a mod design of teal dots that are quite attractive and appealing.  My girlfriend, Tammy, and I babysit a neighbor's young daughter, Kelly.  One afternoon, she spied some of the cloths lying on a kitchen counter; she used two of them as blankets for her Barbie dolls.  I must say, these microfiber cleaning cloths from DII are extremely versatile.  They can be used to clean your home from top to bottom.  I highly recommend them as house warming gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KA4SXHPRUY5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4RRI#wasThisHelpful","R3KA4SXHPRUY5U","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My condominium's guest bathroom dcor is simple:  It consists mostly of a shower curtain and wall hangings that have a beach motif of shells.  (I live near Virginia Beach's Oceanfront.)  The hand towels, bath towels, and washcloths are various shades of blue.  However, I wanted something new and different, something that would brighten up my bathroom that was beginning to appear and feel drab.  Because I am on a tight budget (my mortgage is very high), I didn't want to spend a great deal of money.  Fortunately, I received the DII Elegant Modern Lattice Lace Shower Curtain.  It is made of lightweight, easy-to-wash 100% polyester.  First, after removing the shower curtain from its plastic, zippered package, I washed it in my washing machine on hand wash cycle.  Then I dried it on low heat in my dryer.  It did not rip, tear, stain, or shrink.  I removed my old shower curtain and had the new one installed in five minutes without any problems.  The DII shower curtain is 72"" X 72"" and fit my standard bathtub/shower stall perfectly.  It definitely needs a shower liner, which is not included, because it is not solid.  It is very lacy.  The eggplant color and lacy design are very gorgeous and stylish, not garish or harsh on my eyes.  It is not a design that will quickly become tiring to look upon as time marches onward.  The shower curtain's design is what I call gender friendly in that both males and females can hang it in their bathroom.  It took me no longer than five minutes to remove my old shower curtain and install the new one on the shower hooks that were already there.  I saved my old shower curtain and stored it in the same plastic bag in which the DII shower curtain arrived.  Now, after a few months, I can alternate shower curtains.  The lacy, eggplant design looks good with a white liner behind it.  I may eventually try it with a shower curtain that has a solid black, navy blue or plum color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIB102NMTYF4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHEO#wasThisHelpful","RIB102NMTYF4N","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Preston, England, 1742, a young farmer is found lying paralyzed on the moors, the victim of a stroke; recently, he had come into possession of a silver apostles spoon that may be part of a hidden treasure.  A goldsmith, Philip Pimbo, is shot to death within his own office, which was locked from the inside.  Friends Dr. Luke Fidelis and Titus Cragg believe there is a connection between the two men and the ransacking of the goldsmith's safe, which contained the finances for Preston's fast-approaching Guild, an extremely prestigious festival.  If they can identify the man who must've been hiding inside Pimbo's office when he was shot, they can locate the stolen money and save the Guild.  ""The Hidden Man"" [following ""Dark Waters"" (Dark Waters (Cragg & Fidelis Mysteries)) and ""A Dark Anatomy"" (A Dark Anatomy: A Mystery (Cragg & Fidelis Mysteries))] is Robin Blake's most intriguing historical mystery in the Cragg and Fidelis series.  Hidden treasure; an ancient, sacrificial altar; insurance fraud; slave trading; cross dressing; human deformities; and bareback riding are just some of its interesting plot elements.  Life in 18th century Britain could be harsh, primitive, and cruel; but it could also be richly colorful.  Cragg and Fidelis enjoy playing amateur detectives among the villagers of Preston.  ""The Hidden Man"" also provides readers a view of Britain's infant judicial system, banking system and forensics in eighteenth century Britain.  Readers will be most appalled by the Guinea Trade, which involved the purchasing of African slaves for huge profits.  While crossing the ocean, slaves existed in deplorable conditions aboard the boats; many died from disease and were thrown overboard to be eaten by sharks.  One out of ten boats were lost.  There is a debate in the Preston courtroom about whether or not ""negroes"" are humans with souls.  Also, women, in general, weren't treated much better than slaves.  Widows were forced into a type of prostitution, always searching for a man who would support them after their funds were exhausted.  Some women were kept in financial bondage by dead employers who willed them land, allowing them to keep it provided they didn't remarry.  Dr. Luke Fidelis and Titus Cragg make a wonderful sleuthing team.  The story is narrated in the first person by Cragg.  He is still happily married to Elizabeth.  (They remain childless, which is a shame.)  Fidelis has a secret lover in Liverpool, the city of sin; he travels there for answers in regards to a slave ship, ""The Fortunate Isle,"" which was lost at sea.  Both men are strong and brave and don't cower before pursuing a villain.  Fidelis is kind hearted, often giving free medical treatment to those who can't afford it.  Cragg, who serves as both coroner and lawyer, does an excellent job during the inquest concerning Pimbo's suspicious demise.  Modern readers shouldn't worry about the readability of ""The Hidden Man.""  This novel is fast-paced and well-crafted.  Words and sentences flow smoothly.  It was an easy, enjoyable read.  Fans of historical mysteries should investigate this series beginning with its macabre debut, ""A Dark Anatomy,"" which involves witchcraft.  ""Dark Waters"" pertains to a heated political race that turns bloody.  ""The Hidden Man"" is more of a detective-like whodunit, which is packed with legal and medical procedures.  Morality and ethics also play significant plot roles.  A higher body count would have been nicer, but one can't have everything.  Still, I hope I can have at least another installment in the Cragg and Fidelis series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R395EHXXM4D5FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125005494X#wasThisHelpful","R395EHXXM4D5FL","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A pyromaniac is terrorizing Brighton, England.  He has many aliases.  Red Westwood knows him as Bryce Laurent, a magician and escape artist who is an expert on surveillance equipment and explosives.  He is determined to slowly torture and murder his former girlfriend, Red.  Thanks to her mom's detective, Red learned that Bryce's entire past is a fabrication.  Bryce begins his campaign of terror against Red by burning alive her current boyfriend, Dr. Karl Murphy.  Detective Sergeant Roy Grace must locate Bryce before he kills Red and everyone around her.  Agonizing, fiery deaths threaten many characters in Peter James's intense thriller, ""Want You Dead"" [following ""Dead Man's Time"" (Dead Man's Time (Detective Superintendent Roy Grace)) and ""Not Dead Yet""(Not Dead Yet (Roy Grace series Book 8))].  The residents of Brighton are living in terror of this insane arsonist.  Bryce Laurent's targets are not random; they all involve his deadly obsession with his ex-girlfriend, Red.  First, he burns down a restaurant, Cuba Libre; Red and he dined there on their first date.  Next, he rigs her beloved car, a vintage Volkswagen Beetle, to catch fire.  Bryce is insane and ingenious, a horrifyingly deadly combination.  If he wants you dead, then most likely you are going to die.  Roy Grace is not the tortured, wounded hero you often find in other mysteries.  He is a very successful detective who has risen up through the ranks by means of hard work and dedication.  Consequently, his first marriage to Sandy fell apart.  She mysteriously disappeared and has recently been declared dead.  Now, he will soon be marrying his live-in girlfriend, Cleo Morey, who performs autopsies at Brighton & Hove Mortuary.  Unknown to Grace, his wife is still alive.  Though Sandy and Bryce don't know each other, both are determined to upset Grace's wedding plans.  There are numerous tense moments in ""Want You Dead"" when the killer is pursuing Red.  She lives to regret having placed a personal ad on the internet.  I have always refused to participate in an internet dating service.  Years ago, I read Mary Higgins Clark's ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance""--a suspenseful mystery in which a serial killer was targeting women who were searching for romance through the classifieds.  ""Want You Dead"" also reminded me of such Hollywood horror classics as ""The Fan"" (1981) (The Fan), ""Fear"" (Fear), ""Play Misty for Me"" (Play Misty for Me - Collector's Edition), and ""Fatal Attraction"" (Fatal Attraction).  ""Want You Dead"" has definitely made me swear off internet dating for all time.  Through the internet, it is very easy for predators to falsify their identities in order to attract certain types of victims.  Pedophiles use the internet to deceive and lure minors.  Let this novel serve as a warning for those searching for a dream love.  They may find a nightmare in the form of Bryce Laurent, one of the vilest villains I've encountered in literature.  He is a sociopathic egomaniac who has no qualms about hurting those around him; in fact, he enjoys human suffering.  Like all of the other Detective Superintendent Roy Grace novels, reading ""Want You Dead"" was like reading nonfiction.  It is packed with medical and police procedures.  Peter James provides enough detail about golfing, yachting, firefighting, etc., to convince readers that he has actively participated in them all.  James knows how to build suspense with numerous cliffhangers; interwoven subplots; human drama; graphic, gory violence; and a diversity of realistic characters.  My only disappointment was that the body count wasn't higher; there was a potential for many more victims.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend ""Want You Dead"" for anyone who wants to read an outstanding, action-packed thriller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHEUYIJTHHOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125003020X#wasThisHelpful","R2RHEUYIJTHHOR","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An arsonist is terrorizing Currituck County, North Carolina.  In Carova, a vacation paradise for tourists wishing to observe wild Mustangs, Tropical Storm Ana has swept away much dune sand.  Fire Chief Colleen McCabe and Sheriff Bill Dorman discover a badly decomposed corpse that has been hidden between an old beach walkway and the new one that was recently built above it.  Soon afterwards, a charred corpse is found in the smoldering remains of a new home under construction.  Among the numerous suspects are competitive land developers, environmental conservationists, and tour company operators.  Kathryn O'Sullivan's third entry in the Colleen McCabe series, ""Neighing with Fire"" [following ""Murder on the Hoof"" (Murder on the Hoof: A Mystery (Colleen McCabe Series)) and its debut, ""Foal Play"" (Foal Play: A Mystery (Colleen McCabe Series))] is the most delightful, most intriguing one yet.  This novel focuses a large portion of its plot on Colleen's pets: Sparky the playful Border Collie and Smokey the laidback Siamese.  Having once owned a Border Collie, I can attest to the fact that they are extremely intelligent and playful.  (They also love to kill squirrels, rabbits and other rodents; at least mine did.)  Also, the horses play a more significant role.  There are the tour companies that search them out and the construction workers who illegally feed them.  ""Neighing with Fire"" is loaded with conflict. There are some environmentalists who think their cause is more important than those of other environmentalists.  There are competing land developers who are spying on each other, trying to obtain key properties.  The obnoxious tour guides are competing with each other for business.  A lot of characters are playing with fire in order to get what they want.  From wearing silly disguises to murdering another human being, some will do anything.  It is the mystery that also makes ""Neighing with Fire"" an outstanding cozy.  I didn't know the killer's identity until almost the end.  I kept thinking, Colleen better find out who the killer is; we're running out of pages.  Romance is in the air.  Colleen and Bill are growing closer.  Now they are taking long walks together on the beach.  Everyone jokes them about their relationship.  They don't get married in this novel but one of Colleen's firefighting employees does.  Chip and Fawn's wedding is one of the most unique I have ever read.  I am not too fond of weddings, but I would have liked to have been invited to this one.  Sunny beaches; cute, adorable pets; wild Mustangs; feuding characters; fiery explosions; and gruesome deaths make ""Neighing with Fire"" an excellent installment in a unique cozy series that continues to improve with age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0OJNLXEUZ3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066417#wasThisHelpful","RH0OJNLXEUZ3C","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Water is very good for you, especially if you suffer from allergies as I do.  It is a natural antihistamine.  Thankfully, I've been drinking more water since I obtained my blue, 22-Ounce RefresH2Go Sleek Water Filter Bottle.  I've noticed that the water I drink out of it tastes good, as though it came from my glass Contigo bottle (Contigo Purity Glass Water Bottle, 20-Ounce, Greyed Jade).  At work, I have used the Contigo bottle for nearly ten months.  Water from glass tastes better than water from plastic.  I think chemicals from the plastic itself leech into the water.  The only problem with my Contigo bottle is that it is made of glass; I'm always afraid that I'll drop and break it even though it has a beautiful teal bumper case made of hard rubber.  Water from the plastic RefresH2Go bottle tastes as though it came from a glass bottle.  This is due to the filter that is at the end of the straw.  One must remember not to wash the straw and filter with soap.  Only rinse it with clean water.  Only use soapy water on the bottle itself.  I have the OXO Good Grips Water Bottle Cleaning Set (OXO Good Grips Water Bottle Cleaning Set) that helps me clean all my bottles and thermoses.  I am a very clumsy person; I often knock things over, especially when they are sitting on my cluttered desk at work.  The RefresH2Go bottle is leak-proof.  I have turned it upside down and vigorously shaken it and water didn't come spilling out.  In the past, both my cube mate and I have knocked over our water bottles and damaged our paperwork.  I love the sleek design of the RefresH2Go Bottle, which is easy to grip.  Its Noxzema-blue color is gorgeous; it is easy on the eye.  The bottle holds twenty-two ounces, which is two more ounces than my Contigo bottle.  Twenty-two ounces is plenty of water.  According to the easy-to-read instructions that were found inside the bottle, only water should be poured into the bottle.  The cap on the RefresH2Go bottle is easy to screw on and off, even with my arthritic fingers.  The straw is simple to insert into the cap and the filter is simple to insert onto the end of the straw.  Initially, the spout was difficult to lift up.  However, there is a plastic lever that one can press against to help them lift it up.  The water itself can be difficult to sip because it has to pass through the filter.  The filters must be replaced every two to three months depending on how often you use the RefresH2Go bottle.  I will probably be using it mostly at work.  This means that there is one more extra filter I must keep track of in my life in regards to when and how to replace it.  Filter replacements can be ordered from Amazon (RefresH2Go RefresH2Go Filter Replacements, Blue, 3-Pack).  Furthermore, I don't know how sanitary it is to have a water filter submerged in the water that it is supposed to be filtering.  It would be best to filter the water before pouring it into the bottle.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend the RefresH2Go Sleek Water Filter Bottle for office and gym environments.  After two or three months, one can throw away the filter and use the straw without it.  If water continues to taste the same, then don't order new filters.  With or without the filter, this attractive, easy-to-grip, easy-to-clean water bottle is still great to drink from when working or working out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4KOAF83VZ6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBEJHZG#wasThisHelpful","RS4KOAF83VZ6M","A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Otterbox always offers cases that provide great protection, but until recent years, the colors of their cases were always a bit on the drab side. Not so any more, especially when it comes to this case! The soft aqua is especially lovely, and is quite a contrast to the fluorescent coral of the soft rubber portions of the case. I wanted to make a note of those colors, as what's pictured is a bit different than what you'll receive. The pink shown is not straight pink, but is definitely closer to a fluorescent orange-pink, but the blue shown is pretty close, if still just a touch on the greener side.The case is new in its one piece styling, but still provides plenty of protection while being much less bulky than the Commuter series, which is what I always used to opt for before the release of the Symmetry series. The Symmetry series offers good protection with the extra rubber padding on the inside of the case, which has an extra layer of rubber that provides shock protection to the back of your device. There are also no rubber plugs for the charging and headphone ports, which always seemed like a good idea with the Commuter cases, but inevitably ended up annoying me by being in the way whenever I wanted to connect my device to a jack or charger.Thankfully, the soft coral rubber has just enough give to work your phone into the case, but it's not  so easy to work it back out. Had this case come with the circular cutout that all the other Otterbox cases come with to display the Apple logo, it probably would be much easier to pop the device back out, but it doesn't... which, honestly, does puzzle me a little.Overall, I like this new line of Otterbox cases, and the options it offers. The protection it offers should cover the bases of the everyday user, and the colors offered should provide plenty of options. The case is easy to grip where you need it to be, and slick enough on the back to slip into a pocket. While I'm not so sure about that fifty buck price tag, I always find Otterbox products to be a bit pricier than I like, but it's not like you don't know what to expect, and if your phone is protected properly, it's worth the investment for a quality, stylish case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6U24TLVP9M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7TPVJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3K6U24TLVP9M2","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 11.6 inch Stream by HP is a lightweight, well-made system that would be great as a first system for the younger student, or anyone that needs a light duty system to get them through simple tasks.The keyboard is pretty much full-sized, and very comfortable. I compare this to the Asus Transformer Book 10.1-inch 32GB Detachable 2-in-1 Touch Laptop/Tablet T100TA With Keyboard Dock - Grey (Certified Refurbished) (64 GB Storage) that I recently bought myself, and love. Comparing the two systems, I love the wider spread keys of the HP's keyboard, and the lighter weight of the system overall, when holding it in the hand, but I like that my ASUS has a touchscreen tablet/screen that I can disconnect and use independent of the keyboard dock.The resources of the two systems are about the same, so the performance is similar, as well. Because of that, I find the HP to be a bit slow to respond when multiple tabs are open, especially considering all the bloatware that comes loaded on the system. Once the greater portion of that is removed, you're likely to find that you have more than just the 15 GB of system memory that my system currently has, pre-bloatware removal.It's easy enough to pick up a Micro SD card to add more storage to this system, but it's never going to run high-demand games or any other resource-demanding software... of course, it's not meant to run that sort of software, either.Overall, I like this system. The colors it's offered in are great and bright, thus very eye-catching. The resources are on-point for a basic, travel-friendly netbook. For the price, you really can't go wrong with the HP Stream, as long as you keep in mind what it's meant to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VGY2OMPL1UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CQ8SGE#wasThisHelpful","R36VGY2OMPL1UV","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never before owned a curling iron/wand that had interchangeable heads, and think that that's a brilliant idea, even though this price point is going to make this set a bit prohibitive for anyone but the luxury customer or professional stylist. The wand is beautiful to look at, with the white having a pearlescent finish, and the copper accents setting it off perfectly. The cord is the smart no-tangle free-rotating type, which is a great feature to have, and is sturdy and thick, so it should last for many years to come.The unit heats up quickly and well, and has a nice range to it to adjust. The one real qualm I have with it is that there's no clamp to hold your hair in place, so when wrapping your hair around it, it takes quite a bit of work to lay the lock down just-so to get it to effectively style the strands. That's an oversight that really is easy enough to fix, but without that having happened, makes using this a bit of a chore until the user adapts to it...Overall, I think this is a great set to check out, if it's worth the investment to you, but the pricing on each individual piece would give me pause on a regular basis...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CZ718B9MK6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OSNTJC#wasThisHelpful","R15CZ718B9MK6M","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked one of these cases up (in the Purple Amethyst) at a local Verizon store just last evening, and, as is typical in my experience with OtterBox, the case fits perfectly.It is not quite the vibrant, deep purple shade that shows on my AOC monitor, but the color IS accurate on the screen of my iPhone 6s. I  thought I'd make a specific comment on that as, being an artist and very partial to shades and tones of colors when I'm shopping online, accurate color depiction has become an issue for me over recent months in ordering accessories for my devices. Since I get my heart set on a case in a certain shade, and in the last 3 out of 5 cases have received the ordered item only to find that it's NOT the shade shown, it's provided me some frustration. I'm hoping that my hyper critical nature can prove helpful for someone else out there... Just check the image on multiple devices, to be sure.The case provides great protection, and, as you can see, has the cutout to broadcast the high-end quality of the enclosed device. Since I've only just switched to iPhone from my previously beloved Samsung Galaxy (Note) devices (and was a die-hard, hyper anti-Apple customer prior to yesterday), I'd never had the extra boon of that well-known cutout on my cases, but it's a nice way to showcase the lovely original color of the device's casing, without compromising protection of the device.Keep in mind that the warranty OtterBox offers for their devices, should yours break while encased in their product, ONLY covers replacement of the CASE, NOT the enclosed device! I found that out the hard way about a year and a half ago when my Galaxy Note 3's screen shattered while enclosed in an OtterBox case... The case itself sustained no damage, and prior to the incident, I assumed that the OtterBox warranty covered my DEVICE while enclosed in their case... to my expense, and chagrin, I found out that that's not the case... Just thought you should know.As for the actual color of this case, it's a lovely shade of lilac for the hard outer casing, while the rubber inner sleeve is a deeper violet. Both colors are lovely, and show accurately on my iPhone 6s's screen, but are much more muted than my monitor shows...Overall, even though they're a bit pricier than other options, OtterBox does live up to their reputation for protecting your high-end devices. For an alternate that's just about a third cheaper, I've also had luck with Galaxy Note 5 Case, Spigen [AIR CUSHION] Slim Armor Case for Galaxy Note 5 - Champagne Gold (SGP11687), which I never took off in the year I had my Note 5, which I only just got rid of recently. It held up beautifully over the time I used it, and I always got compliments on how elegant it looked (the buttons were easily accessible with that case as well, even though they didn't protrude from the sides of the case as many protective cases do. I loved that about that case).Long story short, there are more and more beautiful yet still protective options out there to take care of your expensive device. Take your time shopping around, and choose what's best for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUVENJAJFSKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7STPYM#wasThisHelpful","R1QUVENJAJFSKX","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've never before thought to consider buying cloth sacks to store my root vegetables in, but now that I've got one, and see how well made this one is, it makes perfect sense to use these to store potatoes, onions, and garlic.The bag is big enough to hold a good 10 - 15 pounds of root vegetables, and considering how those vegetables don't do so well (at least for me), when I stash them in the fridge or under the sink, I'm looking forward to putting the sack I now have to good use.The sack is large, and well-crafted. The burlap is a good grade - not overly coarse, or poor quality - and the lining is well-made and nicely attached with the wooden buttons. The drawstrings are plenty long enough, and the side loop offers a nice option for hanging from a sturdy and well-mounted hook.As soon as mine arrived in the mail, I couldn't wait to add my onions to it (which, maybe, I should've replaced with fresher onions, but I'll see how these hold up first). I'm looking forward to using this to store my root vegetables for a long time to come. With the ability to remove and launder the lining, there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to get years of use from it.Worth every penny for better storage of root vegetables!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6TUN3F8URH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PJ74I#wasThisHelpful","R2B6TUN3F8URH1","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom, who just hit the 72 mark 6 months ago, deals with plenty of ailments and more in her advanced age, including Arthritis, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, and Gout, just to name a few (literally). As one can imagine, she's on a whole slew of daily meds, and I swear, it's like she carts around half a pharmacy in her purse. In light of that, any new supplement or medication that gets added to her daily doses of everything-under-the-sun must be considered both for any interactions it may have, and its efficacy. Knowing how she struggles with her Arthritis, and also knowing how she's touted the use of Turmeric on anything and everything at the dinner table, I thought this would be a good supplement to send her way.She's only been taking these pills for a few days so far, but hasn't experienced any adverse side-effects. There's no unpleasant flavor getting burped up (for) hours after taking the supplement, and she hasn't seen any conflicts with her current medications, so those are all pluses in my book, and hers. As for the effectiveness in fighting joint swelling and her Arthritis, she is seeing improvement after just a short time, and plans to keep taking this in the future.Since it's early on in trying out this new supplement, I'll keep my review updated in case there are any changes, but, so far, so great!

"Over the past year, I've purchased about 8 different Fintie cases for multiple devices that I own, and while they're all quite well-made and well thought out, the solid-colored devices are almost universally inaccurately photographed. The long and short of that is, the colors that you see are rarely quite the color that you get.I've bought a few Fintie products here from Ammie vendors, and quite a few more on eBay, since I can buy them there and not have to sweat the shipping costs. So far, with this line that I use for my T100TAM, I've bought the (light) Blue (which in actuality is a Robin's Egg blue, and the most accurately photographed), the Pink (which is nowhere near the soft pinky/peachy color displayed on multiple websites, and is a much darker standard bubblegum pink - which is a good 5 - 7 shades darker than what's shown everywhere), the Magenta (which is a lovely deep Rose hue - as I was hoping it'd be), and the Purple, which I was hoping would be the almost-Merlot color shown, but which proved to be more of a faded raisin color, and not as appealing as I expected it to be.Of the four that I've ordered and received, I've kept the blue (as it is a pleasant color, and, again, closest to what's pictured), and the magenta - which I love the hue of - but having viewed multiple vendor's pages for these on multiple sites, on four different devices, I can unequivocally say that you can expect the color of the case you receive to be considerably darker or a different tone than what's pictured. I'm not quite sure how many super-bright lights were used to photograph these, but whatever was used completely washed out the colors on the cases being sold, making the product images near worthless for determination of color.As for durability, I've owned and used my blue case for about a month now, and it's holding up well, with no wear visible aside from one tiny spot where the colored leather-like finish has lifted a bit. Other than that, this case fits the device perfectly. I feel that, even with the product image issues, this has been money well-spent!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQOT8VQW8E6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS2CJN6#wasThisHelpful","RCQOT8VQW8E6R","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every so often, I find myself in need of a proper staple gun for mounting artwork at my school, and, in light of that, purchased a light weight staple gun about a year ago to tackle that task. While it was perfectly adequate for that one task, its features can't hold a candle to the features offered by this Tacwise stapler, and the quality of construction evident here.I'd looked at a pretty wide range of staple guns in the ten to thirty buck range, and settled on a Stanley TR45K Light Duty Staple Gun Kit (which was about 30% more when I bought it). As I said, it's been fine, but it's been nothing compared to the variety of features and overall quality evident here.This Tacwise staple gun accommodates five different sizes of staples, as well as headless upholstery pins and nails. Honestly, I had no idea a simple staple gun could cover so many bases! Add to that its solid metal construction, the adjustable pressure lever, and the margin guide, and this thing does everything I could ever ask for from a staple gun, and more!The packaging also has four strips of staples to get you started, and I was lucky enough to receive an extra box of additional staples, so I can imagine that this gun will hold me in good stead for quite some time to come. And while the girth of the handle is a bit large for my smaller women's hands, it's still manageable, and will be just fine for men's hands.Loading the staple gun is easy enough, and the open window on each side lets you see whether or not you'll need to refill the gun soon. The belt loop keeps it close at hand, and locks down easily and effectively, making it pretty worry-free. In use, there's no kickback to throw you off the task you're using it for, and it's pretty quiet while driving staples, nails, and pins into whatever you're using it on.For the price, I don't think there's anything more I could hope for here!

With this topper added to the sleep sandwich that is my bed, I've got a memory foam mattress topped with a 3"" gel/foam memory foam mattress topper; this thing is just the icing on the cake!I've been a BIG fan of memory foam since I got my first mattress topper a few years back, so I love the cushy feel that they give one's bed, but if you're not a big fan of feeling like your bed is swallowing you (noooo, TOTALLY not like Johnny Depp's first big scene on film where he gets swallowed by the mattress in ""A Nightmare On Elm Street""""! ;)  ), memory foam toppers can sometimes be a bit more than you bargained for... Well, with THIS topper, whether you layer it over a memory foam topper or not, it'll have you feeling like you're sleeping on a cloud! And, thankfully for me, I hear no crunching or crackling from the waterproof layer of mine!The sides, as others have said, ARE made of a pretty thin material, and the elastic (which comprises the entire bottom edge of the topper) is just standard weight, not industrial or extra strength or anything, but the construction of this topper didn't look to be any less than I've seen for other similar style toppers at this price point. Long story short, Classic Brands delivered the average construction quality, IMHO - not better, not worse. Additionally, I had no problem fitting it over my mattress and memory foam topper, and have no doubt that it can fully accommodate the maximum 22 inches claimed.I am pleasantly surprised by the fact that the topper stays in place even when I'm shifting around, and it seems to keep me a bit cooler at night - important for me, as I like things on the cooler side, so I can snuggle in and get a few hours of quality hibernation. Memory foam toppers can retain body heat, and leech it back out through the night, so that's a bit of a downfall for those, but that's no problem whatsoever here. And this thing is SO DAGNABBED COMFY!!! Since I placed it on my mattress, I literally can't WAIT for bedtime to snuggle up on the plush rectangle of softness that is my mattress!I hope this thing lasts for the long haul, 'cuz I'm loving every minute that I spend on it! Worth EVERY penny!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IGYMJZHMV3HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5LSHLI#wasThisHelpful","R2IGYMJZHMV3HB","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just like the Bounce Bursts that were my introduction to in-wash scent boosters, this baby powder-scented booster by Dreft is easy to throw in the wash, and adjust as desired for strength of fragrance. The product dissolves away easily, leaving nothing but a gentle, clean scent to make your loads of laundry smell fresher, longer.The only thing that puzzles me about the product page here is the near forty buck price tag listed  - especially when the same sized container is seven bucks at one of the pricier grocery stores in my local area - but maybe that's just an odd glitch...  Either way, this Dreft in-wash scent booster fits right in with my other three bottles of scent boosters, and I'm happy to have it on hand for when I want a soft,  gentle scent wafting from my clothes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TS64KMDZ3W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWNRQ#wasThisHelpful","R6TS64KMDZ3W7","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not really sure how protective these cases are, as I bought the hot pink with a mind to change up my already awesome -  and highly reliable - sleek and streamlined gold Spigen Slim Armor case, and was disappointed enough in the Thor's cheap plastic look to initiate a return request within the hour of receipt of my case.To be fair, the case looks to be well made and of durable plastic, but again, the overall finish is cheap and unfashionable looking. Perhaps Thor himself really did design these -  after a night of hard drinking and one too many smacks to the face with Mjolnir - as that's the only way that one would find this case's appearance to be fashionable. As for me, I'm still waiting for a response to my initial return request, which Amazon requires the vendor give within two days of request submission, and I'm now at 4.Either way, I WILL get my money back, and I plan to use it on a second Spigen case, which has been reliably, and stylishly, protecting my Note 4 since I got it 6 months ago.Not a happy camper.

"... but after two solid days of multiple dedicated attempts to set it up, with no real success, I give up.I suppose I should've known when I saw that my box of components arrived with a second clear sticker stamped ""factory inspected"" applied over the top of the original (and torn) sticker seal, but I still held out hope that it'd work just fine. I mean, I've gotten factory refurbished items before. Maybe that sticker was only there after agents at the factory opened the box to place my ""thank you"" letter inside it for reviewing it for the program. I'm not quite sure. But what I AM sure of is that, after following the very minimal instructions included on the quick start guide, then following the instructions for each individual component, then making multiple attempts to research troubleshooting online for this unit after multiple unsuccessful attempts to set everything up, I am done. Totally.The quick start guide makes it sound SO easy. Plug the hub in. Download the app. Start and follow the app. Voila'! It's all ready to add the additional components!... RIGHT. THAT'S not what I, personally, experienced.No mention is made that the handset will need to fully charge the included battery before you'll get your mobile device to register to the hub. Heck, that may not even have been the problem, but that first glitch couldn't be bypassed until the next day, when my handset's battery WAS fully charged. Then there's the fact that, even though it's all connected as each component has instructed, there's no dialtone on the phone. And yup, everything's hooked up and set properly. Nope, still no dialtone. Then there's the leaving the house for the first time after spending all of this time setting up. Now I'm no longer registered to the hub. Okay, fine, I'm out of the house; everything will reconnect fine once I get home. Uhhhhh, no. And no number of attempts to deregister and re-register my mobile device fixed that issue, even though the hub is connected to my router, which has had no problems throughout the setup, likewise my mobile device's connection to said router. It's just the security system that's had problems with setup.So, yeah, others may have had no problems setting this up and getting it operational. But for me, this system just isn't working. I've followed all the directions (which, in my opinion, HAVE to be missing some paragraphs somewhere). Tech Support closes at 9 pm EST, so they've never been open when I finally was done with my day's tasks, and had adequate time to really sit down, read everything over, and hook it up as instructed. And, I mean, I'm not a technological idiot. I've made countless PC upgrades, PC repairs, and even built my own computer from parts, for Pete's sake; I think I can handle hooking a system like this up... and I could, if the instructions were thorough, clear, and detailed enough... or it could just be that I got a defective system. It looks simple enough, but it just hasn't been.For me, as a woman living in a small apartment, this system looked as if it would be just what I needed, but what I didn't need was additional headaches by way of a system that was supposed to provide me with a sense of security in a low-maintenance, easy-to-set-up set of equipment. That's just not what I feel was delivered here.Perhaps I'll give it another go in a few days, but for right now, I'm stepping away. This just hasn't worked for me as promised.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZDH7WREI4D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ1Y736#wasThisHelpful","R3EZDH7WREI4D4","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned my Spigen Slim Armor Case for about six months now, and had it installed on my beloved Galaxy Note 4 since getting it on the release day for T-Mobile stores.Prior to buying this - my first Spigen case - I'd made the rounds from cheapie-cheapie generic Made In China cases, up to the pricey (and always avoided because of it) OtterBox cases that I saw others carting their devices around in. While in the OtterBox case, I damaged my previous Note 3 (I shattered the paper-thin screen, which one never realizes just how thin they are until you see those dreaded spiderwebbing cracks make their way across the face of your device. Horrid feeling!). After calling the insurance provider for my device, I learned that that OtterBox warranty that I thought protected my device while encased in their product would actually only cover replacement of the OtterBox CASE, NOT my device when inserted into it. So, fool me once... That brought me to trying this Slim Armor Case from Spigen. I'd never heard of Spigen before, but I liked the look of their cases, as well as the price, so here I am almost six months later with my phone still encased in their product, and doing peachy-keen, even after a few minor drops.I've had no difficulty with the kickstand, although it really isn't terribly sturdy, and doesn't hold my device up very well, unless very precisely positioned. The rubber bezel has gripped my device to slicker surfaces all but once since I began using this case way back in November 2014, and the sleek surface on the overall case makes it easy for me to slip into a back pocket, likewise remove from said pocket. Even after all of this time, my case shows no real wear and tear anywhere, and I'm confident that it'll outlast the length of time I have my device before I upgrade to the next great Galaxy Note. The Champagne gold color paired with the black rubber inner casing make for a very elegant presentation of higher-end devices, but in case you're wondering about shimmer vs. non-shimmer finishes for the Slim Armor line (as I was, and really, still am, as the pictures make it hard to tell), I've asked Spigen directly. The agent that replied to my email stated that the Champagne Gold, Electric Blue, and Electric Red cases all have a shimmery finish to them, and that the mint (which I'd originally ordered with my gold, but returned when there was no shimmery finish), does not. The agent didn't mention the Shimmery White case, but I'm guessing that, by the name, that one DOES have a shimmery finish, as well (it is, however, just a guess). For some of us out there, these details may matter, and since I haven't encountered any other reviews that directly address the colors and finish of the cases, I thought I'd go ahead and write out something that made mention of them. Hopefully someone out there will find this information helpful.Long story short, regardless of color and finish, I think Spigen's products are a more than worthy competitor for OtterBox's. I owned three different OtterBox cases for my previous Note 3, and saw nothing there that surpassed what I've gotten with the sleek effects of the Spigen case I have on my new device. Add to that that the buttons on this case are flush with the sides yet still functional, and that I can access stylus, microphone, and device speaker and buttons with no difficulty, then it's safe to say that I'll be going with Spigen over OtterBox from here on out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYX30ZVOE8J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAWQAA0#wasThisHelpful","R2AYX30ZVOE8J0","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... at least from a carpet cleaner in the four hundred dollar range.This is the second full-fledged carpet cleaner that I've ever owned (the first being the Dirt Devil FD50105 Quick and Light Carpet Washer), and the performance of this Oreck machine is on par with the Dirt Devil that I have. Unfortunately, at four times the price, the Oreck's performance doesn't exceed the Dirt Devil, and if one is expected to pay over four times as much, IMHO, the performance should exceed what I've seen.Assembling and filling the unit is easy enough, although draining the clean/ing water was not quite so easy, considering the way the tank is made. If one is expected to use water with cleaning fluid/detergent added, then empty and reuse that same tank with nothing more than clean water in it, I would think that Oreck would've designed the tank to drain better than it does. As it stands, I had to jostle the water back and forth repeatedly in order to get it out of the greooves of the tank, and completely out of it, and some cleaning fluid was still there, even with five to six attempts to shake it all out. Added to that is the diminutive size of each tank... My apartment isn't terribly large at 750 square feet, but even still, doing all of the carpeting required 4 tank refills. Add to that the fact that this machine just doesn't seem to suck as much water back out as my Dirt Devil does, and there's one more reason to ding the unit a star.I was all kinds'a excited to get my hands on this Oreck, and while its upholstery attachments and the ease of use of them (just attach them to the receptacle for them and go to town on your furniture - an added plus, and a nice touch, there), those are still not quite enough to make me feel that the four hundred dollar price tag here is justified, in light of overall performance.Good, just not great, and a bit overpriced, to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5AEORT60X48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWN6#wasThisHelpful","R3B5AEORT60X48","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like every other month some manufacturer or other is coming up with a new way for the digitally-connected to listen to their devices, and it's to the distinct benefit of us, the customers. I've never heard of NYNE before, but with this Cruiser speaker, they've put a competitive and smart device on the market that's suitable for just about anyone with an active lifestyle that likes listening to their device/s on the go.The Cruiser is compact and comfortable in the hand, and the casing on it is well-designed with buttons that leave no question to the user as to what controls/does what. I really appreciate that, as not every portable audio speaker device out there makes it so easy. The pouch just fits the cables and the speaker, but it makes it that much easier to either toss it into your gym bag, hook it onto a belt loop, or toss into a tote bag for the beach so that you have it wherever you're going. The enclosed grips make it easy to attach it to your bike's handlebars, but they also will work beautifully on a stroller, whether you happen to be going for a jog with your little one, or want to play a soothing lullaby to get him or her to drift off to sleep.Each element of the music that I play through this Cruiser comes through loud and clear and, while I don't own a Beats Pill or any other uber-pricey speakers, I do have a few portable ones that float around the hundred dollar mark, and this small speaker sounds just as good as anything else I've listened to. It's also adaptable and easy to use for phone calls (although I can't quite tell where the mic is), and, even though my mom can't quite seem to hear me on this, I'm not blaming the Cruiser for that. Sorry, mom, but you're 76 in two days, and nothing that I've ever had you listen to my call on ever seems to sound that great to you, so I'm chalking it up to your well-seasoned and overused ears. It must be a result of all of those years teaching highschoolers how to sew... Those sewing machines can hum quite loudly, after all... ;)Long story short, for the features, quality of sound, customization options (including color selection, 'cuz, hey, for some of us, that's really pretty important! ;) ), and, of course, price, I can't imagine you're likely to find another speaker that offers what this one does, at a better price-for-value ratio.

"I've got a Dirt Devil carpet cleaner that is the only other carpet cleaner I've ever owned, or used. While this Bissell Spot Clean ""spot bot"" type cleaner is meant to specifically remove set-in stains, and not fully clean carpets in the method advertised for other designated carpet cleaners, I found that my dedicated carpet cleaner cleans just as well as this Bissell SpotClean; I didn't really notice a difference.As others have said, I also was disappointed to find that this spot cleaner doesn't truly heat the water, as the product information page leads you to believe, and the residual heat produced by the motor just isn't enough to maintain any real heat for the deep cleaning that most customers are likely to purchase this cleaner specifically for.I do give kudos for the various tools that come with this cleaner, as they add versatility to it, and it's easy enough to use. It just doesn't have the real power that the product name and description led me to believe.

"OXO has been a kitchenware company whose products I've used for years, and they've rarely let me down.This scrubber and tray are handy and effective in the kitchen for removing baked-on gunk when you don't want to resort to anything as harsh as steel wool.

The foam beneath the scrubbing surface is soft and allows some give, while the upper scrubbing layer looks durable enough to get the average kitchen through, I'd guess, a good three months or so of regular use.

"As most everyone else does (or, at least I'm told, should do), I change out my windshield wipers annually to ensure proper performance in all weather, but typically, I stick to the basic wipers available. I've purchased Bosch wipers once in the past, and liked them, but I rarely have found one brand to outperform another. This is a bit more of the same so far with these, at least when it comes to a brand new blade, and before a few months have gone by.The cheapie-cheapie blades that I've purchased in the past have given out and decreased performance by about the halfway point of the year from what I've seen, and I d have to say that, from what i can remember, the Bosch blades that I've installed in the past seemed to hold up better, for longer time periods. I'm not sure if that's because, here in the Virginia Tidewater region that I live in, the weather tends to be milder, but the proximity to the ocean and salt air here I""m sure takes its toll on cars in other ways. Bosch has a great reputation for quality products, and I have no doubt that the one Insight blade that I received for review will hold up better than other, cheaper blades that I've tried. Looks like, in order to make it a complete pair, though, I'm going to need to purchase a companion blade here, as they're apparently not offered in my local area yet.The Bosch insight blade has a sleek, high-performance look to it, with its fully encased rubber blade. The spring-like shaping of the blade also presses it gently against the windshield along its full length, so that ensures that it'll keep your windshield squeaky clean for the life of the blade.So far, good performance, but nothing out of the ordinary. I believe time will tell, though, and that the sleek new blade that I've installed (its partner soon to come), will prove to hold up and perform well over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GNINVU5O5YYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ1LG#wasThisHelpful","R1GNINVU5O5YYE","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a few gaming headsets over the years, some by companies I'm familiar with (and proved to live up to the company reputation), and others by companies that I really wasn't terribly familiar with, but yet still, proved to earn a feather in the cap of the manufacturing company.In light of that, this Afterglow Nur headset by prior to this unknown-to-me PDP, proves to be on the lower end of the scale for me. While the headset is very comfortable on the head, nicely cushioned and appears to be sturdily made, the audio quality is just not there. The overall sound is just rather flat, regardless of whether I'm talking with family on my Galaxy Note 4, chatting during an online gaming session, or listening to music directly from my desktop system via one of the many included cables here. The boom mic does pick up sound well and provide clear audio to those that you talk/chat with via these headphones, but the feedback pretty much negates any value that that mic provides. I wasn't the only one hearing an echo of my own voice; the people I was speaking to complained of the same thing - hearing themselves while I used the headset. As soon as I disconnected the headset, that feedback stopped.As other reviewers have stated, the audio quality is just not there with this headset. It doesn't seem to boast any quality beyond 2.1, and in today's day and age, that's just not good enough, especially for a headset that's beyond the hundred note price point. The colors of the headset, when set to the ""Auto"" setting, scroll through a beautiful spectrum of colors, but again, as they're on your head, it's not like you can enjoy that directly, either, and even though this headset has the ""cool factor"" with regards to its appearance, that's just not enough to justify the price here for the substandard performance that this headset offers.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DAB1GNTRF6UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5YYT6#wasThisHelpful","R2DAB1GNTRF6UD","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a now-avid coffee drinker, night owl, and Elementary school teacher, I need a boost of energy first thing in the morning, and the synthetic, chemical-heavy taste of such compounds as Five Hour Energy have never been my favorite thing. While I'm not so sure this Little Miracles energy drink would replace either my morning coffee, or the big burst of a Five Hour Energy product (in case I need a really intense burst of energy), it did give me a pleasant energy boost paired with a delicious, light, fruity flavor, without being too sweet or at all synthetic tasting.The ingredients listed here are high enough quality to soothe my perpetually guilty conscience, and the fact that they're all all-natural and organic makes me feel that much better about the one bottle I got to try.

"After looking for a new, innovative crochet book for quite some time now, I ended up stumbling across this one here on Amazon. I viewed the information I could, which was enough to incite me to order a copy. Upon receipt of the book, I eagerly leafed through the pages, already imagining all of the places in my home that the awesome, clever, and innovative designs within would go...Then I got to the page listing the suppliers, and was stunned and deeply dismayed to find that at least 80% of the materials used here are only to be found in Finland.I figured buying the materials online, even from a Finnish website, would be within my grasp. After all, my mom already thinks I'm addicted to online shopping, I do so much of it... Then I tried doing just that, which was just another exercise in futility, trying to figure it all out. Beautiful products are shown on the suppliers' website, but trying to figure out how to actually order from them was beyond me. There ARE alternates suggested and, I suppose, available (somewhere), but they're not going to be easily found, and you can pretty much bet that you'll be VERY lucky to find any of those alternates at your local big name crafting stores... Searching online produced no results, and I even attempted to find something at my local hardware store to approximate the fishnet twine. Nope, no luck there, either.Don't get me wrong, the book is beautiful, as are the designs within. But for me, looking through this book has been like taking a diabetic to the window of a candy shop. I am intensely disappointed that the items I was so eagerly anticipating the crafting of as I waited for my book to arrive, are going to remain beyond my reach. I mean, really, what's the point of publishing a book that solely uses products that are essentially not available to you?SO disappointed. I almost wish that they had just kept this book in Finland, since they, at least, can get the materials needed to create these items. Looks like the rest of us are just pretty much out of luck.SO disappointed!","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232IE38AWYVZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909342688#wasThisHelpful","R232IE38AWYVZ9","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, I've been a Burt's Bees addict, and I'm familiar with the Tom's of Maine brand, but, prior to this lip balm, had never tried any of their products. Well, I may have just found a worthy replacement for my Burt's Bees fix! This lip balm is pleasantly minty without being overwhelming, and makes my lips feel smooth and silky, without making them feel overly ""wet"" or silicone slick like some other lip balms I've tried!Definitely worth a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAASQVK4P0P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC33H00#wasThisHelpful","R1GAASQVK4P0P0","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since the nutritional stats are clearly posted for all to see, I'll comment on the flavor of the product: to be honest, I find it chalky, and not very reminiscent of a great chocolate. In light of that observation, the nutritional value here outweighs any real issues one might have with the flavor, and there's always the option of adding a little quality unsweetened cocoa, like Ghirardelli's. I also found the powder to be a bit cloyingly sweet, but this is, once again, something that can be adjusted with a few minor tweaks.Mixing the drink up isn't difficult, and using my Magic Bullet, it blends up smooth and creamy, after some dedicated hand stirring to get everything started. The protein and nutrients here also have the effect I was hoping they would: I find myself satisfied and not feeling hungry for many hours after drinking this in the recommended one cup water/one scoop powder ratio.For the regular consumer of protein drink mixes, my take on the flavor here might be one that you've already moved past. The value of a quality protein drink mix is most likely to lie in the nutritional value for you, and you've probably already accepted that the flavors are not going to be akin to high calorie creme brulees, chocolate souffles, or caramel flans; undoubtedly you gave up such diet murderers years ago. But for those of us looking to transition into healthier meal replacement options in an effort to get to the fitter place that you're already in, I'm hoping that this information will prove  at least a little helpful. If this, and other, protein drink mixes can help me cut back on my caloric intake while bumping up my consumption of protein and the nutrients my body actually needs, I'll consider this one of my new close friends.The stats here speak for themselves. While this may not be the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth, it's unquestionably one of the healthiest, and for that alone, it's worth adding this to a cleaner eating plan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RID1PCNQ5GRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYRXDHE#wasThisHelpful","R2RID1PCNQ5GRK","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, this particular pantiliner has been my go-to brand and type when I want mass quantities on-hand. The only others that I prefer  over these are Carefree's body shape extra longs, but, again, those only come in the smaller packs (from what I've seen), and also have a whole lot more packaging to them, between the plastic packs they come in, then the plastic pouches that each individual liner is further packaged in.As far as comfort and all-day wear goes, Carefree's products are the ones I prefer. I've found that Kotex can feel a bit odd against the skin, with a strange, almost slick plasticky feel that I really don't like, and the adhesive on other pantiliners just doesn't seem to hold throughout the day. Carefree's adhesives can give out as well, should they be subjected to fresh-off-the-clothesline undies that haven't quite completely dried yet, but the adhesive of just about any liner out there is likely to give out in that situation. Carefree's liners stay comfortable throughout the day, absorb enough that they can carry you through the lighter days in your cycle, and they don't tend to stick to or feel strange against my skin, like others can.If you're a larger or plus-sized woman (like me, at a size 18), the longs may be just what you need to give you better coverage, and I feel that Carefree has the best pantiliners out there... Which is why they're the only brand you'll find in my bathroom cabinet, 10+ years running.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7OFAN0021DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNJ6MS#wasThisHelpful","R3R7OFAN0021DS","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those of us that have old (or soon-to-be new) favorite family recipes stashed around the house on random note cards, slips of paper, and even back covers of magazines (scribbled in a fit of culinary inspiration), this recipe binder by Avery is a very smart way to take an existing product, amp it up, and customize it to make your very own handcrafted cookbook with all of those beloved recipes in one easy-to-find place.The page protectors and inserts that come with the separate Avery My Recipe Binder Starter Kit, 1 Set of 8 Tab Dividers, 5 Each of 2 Pocket Recipe Card Protectors, 10 Sheet Protectors (19915) do a great job of, as the title claims, getting you started with organizing all of those paper slips and note cards, providing note card page protectors, full-size sheet page protectors, and customizable tabs. On top of that, you can go a step further by printing your own page inserts that you choose from a variety of designs for, to truly make this your own personal recipe book.I think Avery has really been smart in figuring out yet one more clever way to put their products to use here. I never would've thought of just picking up a standard binder, getting page protectors, and putting all of those recipes I've got laying around into a binder like this, but it's very clever, works, and polishes up something that, before now, has both looked haphazard, and not always been so easy to track down. If you're having a hard time figuring out what to get for that culinary master or maven that you know that you feel already has everything, this just might be the ticket right here!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S0XNWIK33LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP4W9W4#wasThisHelpful","R9S0XNWIK33LE","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I swear, adding a scale to your home during the holidays is like deciding to treat yourself to an Iron Maiden for a fun play toy, but at least I can say that this sleek black scale by Taylor puts my old scale to shame on so many levels.This scale is polished and elegant looking with its smooth black finish. It's large enough to be comfortable for anyone to stand on (although the cold glass can be a bit of a shock to the bared soles). The underpainted finish seems almost like a baked enamel, so it's not going anywhere, and the accuracy here far exceeds any scale I've had before.With my previous scale, I'd have to weigh three  times, and go with the number that came up most often, even though the scale was never repositioned. That was after having to press on it and wait for it to tare itself out each time. Here, you just step right on, and a scant three seconds later, you've got your weight, down to the ounces, and as accurate as I've seen in a LONG time!As far as scales go, this one is a lovely addition to my home. Elegant, accurate, easy to use with large numbers in the digital readout, thick, tempered glass surface, and puts my old Thinner brand scale to shame (so in the trash it went)! Worth every penny, and will look good in anyone's bathroom or home gym!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YBOD9HF9Y48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA7R6ME#wasThisHelpful","R5YBOD9HF9Y48","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this keyboard after much debating and searching online, hoping that ALL of the reviews about defective keyboards were written by a small portion of customers, rather than their representing the greater bulk of customers. Long story short, nope. My keyboard was  defective right out of the box, too.I decided to risk it going by the lovely colors of the backlighting. And they really ARE lovely - IF you can get them to stay on!My keyboard installed with no problem (of course, since the basic pre-installed Windows drivers are all you really need). The problems made themselves evident, however, from the first time I tried scrolling through the colors to see what each looked like. The red (which is the first color on the scheme), green, and blue worked fine, but every time I tried to change to yellow, cyan, pink, or white, the keyboard would shut off for a few seconds (fully disconnecting from my system), then finally restart, right back at red (not one of my favorite colors here).Trying to figure out how to call ChallengerUSA for replacement was an exercise in frustration, so your best bet is probably to go ahead and write a review here (although after I finally gave up and just reluctantly sent an email on their bare bones site, I did get a response the very next day). They emailed me a prepaid return label, and my mail carrier picked the parcel up, which was six days ago. Since then, I've heard nothing more back from ChallengerUSA, and have yet to receive my replacement keyboard. At this point, I'm just hoping to receive my replacement keyboard some time  before the holidays are officially here, and a working one at that, but I'm just not holding my breath.The reviews declaring quality control issues are all completely accurate. A product is only as  good as its functionality, and this one needs a serious overhaul in the quality control department. Yet another ""made in China"" item that feels like it's just Dollar Store value. So disappointed. Just as a P.S. - I got mine when the price was a penny less than a twenty note. Even THAT ended up proving to be too much to pay... The $36 price tag they're set at right now (12/15/14) is ridiculous, considering the quality control track record here.*UPDATE*So, here I sit, second keyboard in front of me, with the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS that I experienced with the first: attempting to set any color beyond the initial 3 causes the keyboard to reboot itself, shutting off, sitting completely unlit and unpowered for about 12 seconds, then restarting on red. Trying to set any color beyond red or the ""breathing"" effect of scrolling through each color is an exercise in futility. And it's not my system. I did a full driver check, purge, and update about two weeks ago (which took painstaking HOURS of time), deleting every single old and possibly corrupted driver in my Device Manager for any device that I had previously installed and subsequently uninstalled, then using multiple methods to update and double-check each remaining driver on my system. Everything is up to date, so the fault here lies solely with this keyboard, and the lack of quality control for it. And this is after I asked, MULTIPLE TIMES, that agents in ChallengerUSA's Quality Control/Tech Support/Customer Service department thoroughly check my replacement for full functionality. I guess asking four times isn't enough.The colors here, again, are great, IF you can get them to stay on, but at 0 for 2 on keyboards that SHOULD work, but don't, I won't be buying anything sold by ChallengerUSA ever again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me...*FURTHER UPDATE*I feel like I'm being given the runaround from CS here, being told that they're going to check with tech support for a workaround. A Windows 7 compatible keyboard either works on a Windows 7 system, or it doesn't. My system is Windows 7 x64 SP1, with the latest Windows Update, installed just this evening right before connecting the new (still defective) keyboard, and I'm STILL having the EXACT same problems. Getting nothing but the runaround at this point has pushed me to just give up on this and ChallengerUSA, and just go ahead and order an Azio PRISM USB Keyboard with 7 Colorful Backlights (KB507). Since new egg has them for twenty five bucks right now, that's just a few dollars more than this nightmare of non-functionality has cost me (not including the expense of my sanity).Save yourself some frustration, and just say no. It's not worth the headaches.*FINAL UPDATE*The Azio PRISM USB Keyboard with 7 Colorful Backlights (KB507) is working just fine on my system since I received and installed it this evening. Drivers installed perfectly, all 7 colors and multicolor setting come up just fine. I have not experienced any of the issues I dealt with with the Redragon Karura K502.So, yeah, again - my system wasn't the problem (as I suspected all along). It's the defective keyboards sent out by Redragon that caused my system to experience problems with it.Until ChallengerUSA does an obvious and decisive overhaul of their Quality Control department, again, I won't be buying anything else from them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1UBRTRM5BVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSGKEC4#wasThisHelpful","RH1UBRTRM5BVK","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little booklight is the first that I've gotten since my first one years and years ago when those long-clip book lights first hit the market. I've often found booklights to be a bit unwieldy,  as they were frequently heavier than the paperback book I was holding, and they just never quite seemed to put out enough light for my taste. The design on this Carson booklight, though, is clearly much better thought out than that of those old, staid models.The light on mine really isn't quite as bright as I'd like, so I'm not sure if I just have a funky pair of batteries, but the light IS bright enough to be helpful. It's easy enough to turn on, as the power button is on the back of the lamp head. The plastic here is very sturdy, and has a feel that reminds me of Melamine, so I expect it to last for many a year to come. The clamp is solid, has clear rubber feet that serve as grips - placed on both sides of the clamp - so they'll hold well to even slick magazine pages. The clever design that allows for the head to nest inside of the clip both protects it during shipping, and offers another option: if you turn the lamp on before nesting the head in the hole on the underside of the clip, you can use it as a flashlight for when you've got to navigate tight spaces and may need to hang it from your wrist, or clamp it for stability, as in working behind a tall PC tower or entertainment center.The overall quality construction, cute and quirky design, and versatility of this book light will have you putting it to use for more than just reading. While mine isn't quite bright enough to turn all of the lights off and read by, I know that it's going to come in handy for many a task in my home!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5AKG63K9L0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFUAZPA#wasThisHelpful","R3V5AKG63K9L0Y","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Coffee-Mate liquid creamer comes in a BIG bottle, so be sure to clear some counter space before you get your package! The pump for it is packaged separately, and in order to have the option to reuse mine, I used a large metal file to file the teeth around the neck of the bottle down (not necessarily something that's recommended, but since it's just me, and hot water should be able to clean it out, I'm not too worried).The creamer itself is very thick, so much so that when I initially received the bottle and shook it around, I was worried it might have solidified on me a bit during shipping (it's recently been pretty chilly here in Virginia). Nope, not coagulated, just super thick. In fact, the consistency is about that of sweetened, condensed milk.The enclosed pump works well to push through a stream of thick, syrupy liquid creamer, but for anyone worried that the ""sweetened"" here means ""oversweet"", don't - I like a little coffee with my cream and sugar, and it wasn't quite sweet enough for my super sweet tooth just as is (I still added my heaping four teaspoons of sugar to my standard 16 oz cup). If you're not a big fan of super sweet coffee, you're still very much in the clear here.Had I not recently taken a buttercream decorating class, I might have been skeptical of the claim that sugar makes foods shelf stable for a while, but the books and instructors that I've checked with make the same claim for icings with milk in them - apparently that bit of sugar DOES help to fight off any bacteria that might otherwise grow in and compromise food items left unrefrigerated. The taste imparted by this creamer is pleasantly creamy, not heavy on the tongue, and again, not too sweet.This creamer will serve you well whether you're putting it in an office, or a kitchen with lots of coffee drinkers around, and you get plenty of servings for your money - even the heavy creamer users should get a good 150 cups out of this!

"You might say ""a hairdryer is just a hairdryer"", and that would be pretty accurate for the average customer (although I'm sure my stylist would have a BIT more to say on that topic)! ;) But, for me, it's the little things that take a reliable, quality hairdryer a bit further, putting it at the front of the pack. The features and functionality with this dryer help to move it to the top of the list for the dryers I currently have at home.I picked up this Conair 1875 Cord Keeper to replace a reliable, still functional Conair Ionic Pro dryer that I got 4 years ago (and no longer appears to be available here). That dryer is still working great for me a few years after first getting it, but I have to admit that, as with most hair appliances, that cord just bugs me every time I use it! I guess, really, if that's the only qualm I have with it, it's doing a bang-up job, but the little plastic tab that is used to keep the cord in place after wrapping is always just a pain to deal with. Thankfully, with the cord keeper feature of this dryer, that's no longer an issue.All of the functionality of my previous dryer is still here with this one. The rocker buttons on it allow you to select hot (for if you either have really thick, coarse hair - or are just a masochist, and decide to concentrate the heat via a soft bonnet curler dryer attachment, like I use  ;)  ), warm - the setting that I prefer with my mass quantities of fine hair rolled on curlers and tucked under said bonnet, or cool - which I often use to finish out my 45 minute hair drying sessions. The Cool Shot feature is also another great one for a blast of extra cool air (kind of amazing to me, considering the hot air my dryer's just been blowing out, followed by the A/C cold air that this button activates). The Cool Shot is great for locking in curls, so it's a must-have for me. The filter on the back is removable, and thus easy to clean - yet more insurance that the dryer will give you many years of great service. Add to that the fact that now you don't have to FIGHT with yet another cord after your styling session is over, and the great condition that my hair comes out when I'm done using this dryer, and there's my reasoning for moving this dryer to the top of my list!The cord rewind on mine isn't quite as strong or great as that on my typical cord rewind vacuum (my hair dryer pulls almost the entire cord up, but leaves just a little less than about a foot hanging out). It's easy enough, though, to just gently push the remainder of the cord into the channel, and push the cord rewind button again for the dryer to retract the remainder of the cord.LONG story short (sorry - I have a tendency to do that! ;)), Conair has put out yet another quality dryer here, with that last remaining convenience that I'm sure will find these in many a household to come! Pair that with the gorgeous, sparkly, ruby red nailpolish color it comes in, and it's pretty and sleek enough looking to happily hang it on display in your bathroom! Love it! 4 1/2 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20GIE7C8R534T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0WRO08#wasThisHelpful","R20GIE7C8R534T","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years now, I've known Alienware to be a high-tech, high quality computer product brand, and, while I've always wanted to say I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of their products, I never have been. Until now. And it was SO worth the wait!I first got introduced to Alienware products a few years ago by a gamer friend of mine who works in Technology. Aric was always one to thoroughly research anything he bought, and go with the best bang-for-the-buck he could find, regardless of price (within reason). I was impressed with his Alienware system then, but I'm even more impressed with the Alienware Alpha, now that I've gotten my hands on it.Setup was no more difficult or labor intensive than setting up a standard new PC or computer system, and, just so you know, anyone that tells you that this system is NOT a full-fledged PC in and of itself either hasn't set it up themselves, or hasn't thoroughly checked it out. Aside from the lack of a DVD/CD drive (which an external option can be purchased at minimal cost, but for most, may not even be necessary any more), everything that you could need to use this system as a full-blown, dedicated PC is here. Toss in an external hard drive for extra space (as requested by the system for storage of music, pictures, and video), and you're good to go, but even that's not necessary, as a full Terabyte will be more than enough space for the typical gamer's needs.Upon connection and first-time startup, the system walks you through the typical PC selection screens, then loads up the initial Windows page, where you're asked to select the format you want to set up your Alpha in. You're given a choice of Console (which only requires the included Xbox controller), or Desktop (for which a mouse and keyboard ARE necessary), and whatever you choose is the mode that the system will startup in from that point on. Even though this is billed as a console, I decided to set mine up as a Desktop, after which it is clear how much of a full-blown, and fully loaded, PC system this lovely little box of joy is. Being that this is my first Windows 8.1 system, it was a different experience navigating the system for the first few minutes, but once I acclimated to it, it's been no big deal. As I was using both a wireless keyboard and mouse (the mouse was recognized with no problem from system startup), and the Logitech drivers for the keyboard were (obviously) not preloaded, I had to turn on the on-screen keyboard under the Ease of Use settings, but once that was done, it was super fast and easy getting everything else going. I had connected this system directly to my network via an Ethernet cable, but aside from the drivers for the equipment I connected, I had none of the issues of system updates and multiple reboots that others have complained of, so, from there, it was on to logging into my Steam and Microsoft accounts (the same Microsoft account that I had to set up for use with my Xbox Gold membership a few years back), and then getting on with the playing! I have an existing Xbox controller, but after fiddling around with it, and trying to pair it with this system to avoid having to use two different ones, I just decided to go ahead and use the new controller that came with the Alpha. I had issues with my original controller unpairing from my 360, and after I took note that my Xbox is directly below my Alpha, it just made more sense to have one for each device... It paired up just fine with the Alpha via the included USB receiver, although I do find myself defaulting to using my mouse and keyboard for certain games.In Desktop mode, Steam opens up quickly, but with a slightly minimized window, until you select the small Xbox controller icon, which takes you to Steam Big Picture mode, a fully immersive, full screen presentation of the Steam store and any games that you'll play while there. Gameplay is smooth, beautifully rendered, and super responsive with no lag, even at the highest settings. The quad core Intel i5 processor is more than enough to handle anything that you can throw at this console (and should be for many years to come, as the gaming industry - when last I checked - still had yet to modify games to fully utilize more than four processing cores), and with the ridiculously cheap sale prices on Steam right now during Thanksgiving weekend, I was able to pick up 9 new titles, some of those compilations of multiples, for less than fifty bucks. Thanks to those sales, I now own the Bioshock Triple Pack of all three titles, Skyrim, Sid Meier's Civilization V, as well as a few simulations, and Indie games. You just can't go wrong with that much fun for that little cash, and I had no problems accessing all of the games in the Steam store.Ever since setting up this system, I've been playing for hours straight, and loving every minute of it. There's nothing that I can find this console/PC system to be lacking, and the fact that all of this power and awesomeness is packed into a package this small just blows me away. This may be my first Alienware product, but it most definitely won't be my last!*UPDATE (a.k.a. NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!)* And, this IS going to be lengthy - I'm writing so much here so that, should anyone else experience any problems with their unit, they might be able to check their steps against what I tried, both solo and with the assistance of Laura, the very adept, patient, and dedicated Alienware agent out of Costa Rica that helped me out so much (thank you, Laura! I hope they give you a raise! ;)  ).So, this evening, after leaving my console on and unattended for about an hour and a half, two hours at most, I go back into the living room (where I have it connected in my entertainment center) to find that my TV's screen has gone black. The same screen that my Alpha is connected to. The same screen that, when I scroll through my A/V receiver's ports, successfully display the screen of every other device. Every device, that is, but my new, coveted, this-was-my-Christmas-present-since-I-can't-afford-to-buy-myself-anything-in-this-price-range-this-year Alpha. You can imagine the heartache and heartburn that proceeded to set in.So, I try a hard reset. Three separate times. Nothing, no response on-screen. Blue system LEDs light up, but nothing displays on-screen. Maybe it's the HDMI cable? I'd used the one that came with the Alpha, so I first tried a few different A/V ports, then the extra one on the back of my TV, ensuring I switched to the correct input selection with each change. Nothing. Tried unplugging the unit from the power, counting slowly to 30, reconnecting everything & switching the power back on. Maybe the HDMI cable died? I try a different one, same multiple steps, same attempts with different ports. Nothing. *sigh*. Okay, I give in. Time to call Dell/Alienware Tech Support.... Uhhhmmm.... yeeaaahhh... Three phone calls later, and a chat window session where the agent literally took no less than two to five minutes between each response (many of which asked me questions I'd already answered when explaining the situation), I finally get Laura (this is after speaking with Rose, who accidentally disconnected my call, then another agent who transferred me through to Alienware Tech Support from the Dell number I'd dialed. The Alienware agent then, a young man, told me that, after I'd explained the situation, he was going to transfer me through to Alienware Product Exchange and Replacement... Instead, he transferred me through to an automated system that, because it was after 10 pm EST, told me that it was sorry, that department is closed, I'll have to call back again tomorrow). Well, thank God for Laura, who I got, again, on the fourth attempt to get assistance with my seemingly defective Alpha after less than 36 hours of up time. I explain to Laura exactly what's going on, the steps I've taken, and just how stressed out, frustrated, and disappointed I am at this point that my first coveted Alienware product appears to have died on me (I have friends that swear that it's one or the other of my two tom cats (because more than two, and you've crossed the threshold into Crazy Cat Lady Land), who they are certain are gremlins that screw with my technical gadgets while I'm not looking). She proceeds to attempt troubleshooting with me. She asks me, since there are no audio problem indicators with the Alpha as with other computers, whether I've noticed any sort of flashing pattern with the light that illuminates the alien head during any of my troubleshooting steps. I explain that, no, the light was always solid, no flashing patterns.We tried reconnecting the unit, for starters. This is a good half hour to 45 minutes since I've completely disconnected it - no power cable connected, HDMI, Xbox receiver, or USB mouse or keyboard dongles attached. I point this out because, after I plugged the power back in, and pushed the alien head to power it back on, it opens up right at the desktop splash screen - the last screen that would've been displayed before whatever error occurred.  Keep in mind, though, that it's been COMPLETELY disconnected from the power and everything else for at LEAST a half hour - just laying on my bed during my prior failed call attempts. Alienware, indeed... Anyway, after we see that it's back up and running and I've reconnected the USB dongles, Laura has me put it to sleep again. It goes into sleep mode, but as soon as I touch one of the keys on my attached wireless keyboard to wake it up, the power completely shuts off on it, I see the dreaded black screen again for a few seconds, then it goes to the blue ""there's an HDMI device that's normally powered on and displaying on this TV input, but there's no power from it"" screen. We wait a few seconds, switch to a third and previously untested HDMI cable, and try to power it on again. Nothing happens, but I can hear the fan on the back of the unit running, and it's blowing out warm air. No activity light from the hard drive is visible, even when I hold my hand directly behind the unit to catch any flashes of activity. We try disconnecting everything again, giving it a few seconds to clear anything that might be in the cache, and reconnect the HDMI cable and power cord (I've already disconnected the USB dongles again). This time, it starts up, running through the initial Alienware splash screen and the typical startup screens.At no point in time did I ever see the LEDs behind the alien head flash in any patterns, and Laura didn't seem able to completely pinpoint the problem, but she created a replacement order for me, stating that Alienware tech support agents would review her notes, and get back to me within two to three business days, and that a new unit would be shipped to me within two to three weeks. She stated that once I'd received the new unit, that I'd need to ship the existing one back (using the prepaid return label that I'd clearly requested twice - it's not even two days old, so I don't expect to pay to ship a defective unit back). At this point, it's just a waiting game paired with finger crossing in hopes that the next unit I receive won't prove to have any problems like this, or like others have experienced. It makes no sense to me, either, having these problems. I'd just run Alienware Autopsy this morning, doing a default check on the system, as the system recommended, to ensure that all of the hardware and installed software passed all the checks and tests, and all of it did - as it did AFTER whatever glitch that was, when I ran it again about an hour ago, after it DID restart. I've had to do one hard reset since, and after disconnecting the power briefly, and allowing a few seconds, again, for cache clearing, it started up again, but this time at the Windows 8.1 app screen, which was not the last screen I'd had it on. Either way, when there, I went into the system settings, and turned off the 3 hour sleep settings I'd set it to yesterday, the day I'd initially set my system up.I'm not sure what's going on here, but I swear, I feel like someone's stolen my puppy, and I want it back. :( Here's hoping the coming weeks will find me with a properly working unit again, and I'll update here once the exchange process is complete, and I have the new unit up and running.Happy holidays, until then!* FURTHER UPDATE* (a.k.a. back to joy!)Floriana, the Tech Support agent at Alienware that took over my case, contacted me three days after my initial Tech Support help calls to notify me that the request for a replacement unit had been approved, and further contact with other Tech Support agents for extended details informed me that I should expect an update on the shipment of the replacement unit - which would be built from scratch - by no later than this past Friday, six days after my initial reports of issues. Well, not only did I receive shipping status by Friday, I actually received the replacement unit itself on Friday, putting total unit build and problem resolution time at six days total. The new unit is up and running like a charm, and I am back to being fully enamored with this PC/gaming system. I gingerly went through the same steps that caused problems with the old unit, happily finding no repeats of those same issues with this new one. Setting up the new unit also proved to be faster and easier than the initial setup of the original unit I'd received. Once selecting the basic Country, Language, Time , and other initial settings, the new unit found the settings that had been backed up to the Cloud from the first one, so it was a simple matter of applying those settings to the new unit, and I was looking at what seemed to be a carbon copy of the first Alpha, but minus its glitches. No issues here with Sleep mode completely shutting down my system, and it's working like a charm. P.S. for anyone needing Tech Support, try calling eight six six, two eight seven, six seven two seven, then selecting option four for a direct connection to Alienware Tech Support. That was the number given to me by one of the agents I spoke with, and it's open 24/7. Hopefully by spelling it out the bots won't disable or remove it, just in case someone else needs it...For anyone that's looking to cut the cable cord and add PC gaming to their entertainment setup, you really couldn't ask for more than this unit. There's no need for a Chromecast, Roku, or anything else with this system, as it's easy enough to download your favorite web browser to this system (mine being Mozilla), and logging on to any number of websites to view content on your TV. Hulu Plus, Netflix, SyFy.com, IHeartRadio.com, and every other favorite entertainment site of mine come up just beautifully here, of course, since this IS a full-blown PC. Steam can prove to be a bit wonky here and there, and has caused me frustration a time or two, but that's that platform itself, and has nothing to do with the functionality of Alienware's Alpha console. As another reviewer has stated, my old reliable console that I'd been using for the bulk of my entertainment purposes (in my case, my Xbox 360) has sat neglected and forgotten since hooking this console up.I honestly couldn't be happier, so if you are searching for an all-around entertainment center, this is everything you could ever want. In Desktop Mode, it also gives me the comforting appearance and ease of use of Windows 7, my preferred version of Windows. Crunch the numbers and see what the cost of all of those consoles, PCs, and entertainment sources you've bought or are considering buying, total, and I have no doubt that, even at the full-blown Intel i7 version of the Alpha, you'll still save money for the performance that you'll get in this one tiny case.Best entertainment ANYthing I've ever gotten.

"*UPDATE*Since receiving and assembling the unit, I have found that the remote is defective. It did not seem so problematic upon initial install and setup, but it has since proven to be so. While it's not a huge ordeal to get off one's keyster to turn a soundbar on, and adjust its settings, it does become an annoyance, considering that everything that arrives with this stand should be fully functional. Some of the buttons on it work, but the bulk of them don't, therefore, every adjustment to the bulk of the available audio options must be made via the front audio panel of the sound bar itself. Trying to get Customer Support for it has also been a nightmare. Corporate Living's website and phone system state that calls will be returned to customers a day after contact attempts by said customers have been made. I made my first call attempts on Monday. As of the close of business on Thursday, I had given up waiting for a call back, and attempted to call them again. EVERY call that I have made to their Customer Service department has ended with  me having no option but to leave a message, and I have left multiples. I even explained to the line operator yesterday that I've been trying to get a flesh and blood person on the line for days now. She explained that they were in a meeting. I asked her if they had been in a meeting on Monday, as well, as I got no response whatsoever from that department during my multiple call attempts that day, either.I rarely end up dealing with Customer Service departments where NO one EVER answers their phones, and I'm stuck leaving multiple unanswered messages, and when I do, it only serves to give me a more and more negative opinion of the company. Any company that wants to establish a good rapport and solicit repeat purchases from their customers tends to be far more responsive and timely than this. Being that this is a company that I have never worked with before, and it's been THIS much of a runaround with them, even though the bulk of the product seems well made, I just no longer have the confidence to be willing to deal with them again in the future. A product is only as good as its support, and for a piece of equipment in this price range, I expect better.Product quality, overall: 4 stars. Defective item: -.5 Customer service experience: -1.5 stars.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~When I first received my CorLiving TV stand, I was dismayed by the condition of the box - it was quite banged up, even having a few tears pretty deep into the cardboard, and it just didn't look promising considering that half of the stand is composed of tempered glass shelves. I gingerly pulled it by its straps into my apartment (listening for the tinkle of broken glass - thankfully, there were no tinkles of doom to be heard), and my friend (whose assembly help I enlisted) got to assembling it.It seems like CorLiving knows how to package their products to endure rough handling by mail carriers, as everything within the boxes was intact. And, less than 20 minutes later, my friend was done putting it together, with no need of an extra hand from me. The wood sides of this stand are very solid, and heavy, from what he said (and I have subsequently felt in moving it around). I saw that there are also metal frame pieces for both top and bottom, the upper piece being smaller to accommodate the speaker bar that's included. There are three metal shelf tongues to hold the central glass shelf in place, and they do so well, using plastic bumpers to cradle the glass with no risk of shattering it. The one main complaint that my friend had in assembling it was that mine came with no stickers or labels on any of the glass shelves. Being that they're varying thicknesses, and certain shelves go on certain levels, that's not so great. I have a jeweler's gauge that I used to measure the thickness of each to ensure that they were placed correctly, but had I not had a tool meant for precise measurement of thicknesses in millimeters, I'm not so sure that would've been very easy to figure out.Now, on to the product, and its performance. Once assembled, it's a modern-looking, sleek and attractive piece of furniture. While I DO think it sits a bit low to the ground for the purposes of holding up a modern-day TV, it looks good once in place, and is quite wide, although I do find myself wishing it was deeper. If you happen to have your flatscreen mounted to the wall, you'll have no issues with the stand, but if you plan on simply standing your existing TV on this, it may sit a bit low for you, depending on your preference - the stand is only about two feet high, and there's barely half an inch of clearance below it, should that be information necessary for your setup purposes.While the stand is wide enough to offer plenty of space for low-clearance items, the middle shelf is only about six inches from bottom shelf to top, and a good chunk of that height is cut short by the depth of the speaker bar. The bottom shelf is only about five and a half inches high, so there wasn't any standing up of my Xbox 360, or even my Wii (I know, I know, but it's still fun to play sometimes. ;) ). As for getting my Onkyo receiver into one of these shelves? Forget it. Unless I pried the feet from the bottom of it, that just wasn't happening, so instead I have mine sitting on the very end of the top shelf, battling for space with my TV and a 7.1 channel sound bar (it's a long story...).As far as the sound itself goes, it's quite good, but it's not 7.1. Perhaps 5.0... The sound here is better, by far, than that produced by my TV's integrated speakers, and there are adjustments that can easily be made to the bass and treble. There are also five different equalizer-type settings, including Jazz, Pop, and News. The soundbar's connections are on the back side of the bar, and are beneath the top shelf, so they're not so easy to get to, but it's not impossible. My Galaxy Note 4 also immediately found the sound bar in Bluetooth connection mode, and connected to it right away. Being able to play music directly from my phone is a nice feature, and it's easy enough to switch inputs from the front of the speaker bar (and, theoretically, from the included remote, but mine arrived apparently defective, as only 1 in 10 key presses on the remote seem to be recognized).Overall, for anyone looking to upgrade their TV stand and include speakers that will beat those integrated into their TVs, this is a nice stand to consider, if the price is in your range. It's not perfect, but it's quite nice, sturdy, seems to be well-made, and has lots of nice features and adjustable options to round it out.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYSIY7PEEJJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9D8SQU#wasThisHelpful","RMYSIY7PEEJJ3","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read all of the rave reviews on this hair product, and decided to give it a shot. Being that I'm PAST due for my quarterly scalp-burning hair relaxer, I was hoping that this would prove to straighten out and defrizzify my hair just a bit, until I can relax it in a few days. Lo and behold, it actually did!For anyone else out there that has super curly/kinky hair, this might just help you out! Being that Mom's African-American and Dad's Caucasian, my hair isn't the coarsest or kinkiest around, but it DOES need a bit of chemical assistance every three months or so. While I have A LOT of hair (from what my stylists have always told me), my hair does happen to be fine, so I typically use a Regular strength relaxer. While it's not humid or warm, even, outside right now (it's been in the 40s for a few days now, as it's late Fall), my hair, once new growth hits a half inch, starts to show the effects in the roots, which get wooly and thick down under there, and drives me crazy. Applying just about two tablespoons of this product to my freshly-shampooed-and-conditioned, still-wet hair yesterday, I then followed my standard routine of sitting under a standard hand blow dryer with a soft bonnet similar to this Soft 'N Style Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer System (B). Once I took out the curlers, my new growth wasn't relaxer straight, but it was definitely straighter than it typically is when my hair gets to this stage. That, to me, is impressive!The smell of the product wasn't overwhelming to me, and was just a fresh, clean citrusy scent, which did fade pretty quickly. The texture of the product was a bit odd to me - not quite watery, but not quite a gel, either. Either way, it pours easily, and it's just a matter of emulsifying it in the hands, and massaging it through. The bottle is also PLENTY big enough to last any user for at least a good six months, I would guess of every-other-day washings, and, for me, with my once a week regimen, I expect to get a good year's worth of uses out of the sizable bottle.At this price, for its effectiveness, you really can't go wrong. I haven't come across a single product in my 30+ years of styling my own hair that actually DID seem to make good on its claims of minimizing frizz... Until this lovely compound! If you DO have issues with frizz, this just might be exactly what you're looking for! Can't wait to give this stuff a run for my money come the humid summer months, and I'll be sure to update my review with regards to my experiences with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YSX7RSWS6IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCGZ0KA#wasThisHelpful","R5YSX7RSWS6IB","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen the stone version of these in the past in my local TJ Maxx, and always thought they were cool-looking, and a clever idea. Where the pure stone ones were quite novel and just ""neat"", I love the elegant look that these chrome stones have.Whether in a glass of quality whiskey, or gently placed in the bottom of a glass filled with your favorite soft drink, these chrome-finish stones are cool, and they get your drink that way, too. The case that they come in is a nice way to ensure that they stay clean in the freezer, and the two stones are perfect for your average singleton to have on hand to cool a drink or two down before needing to use them again. Since they're filled with liquid (which you can hear if you shake them when thawed), they freeze up pretty quickly, and are ready to go again in no time flat.I look forward to bringing these out at my next intimate dinner, just for the cool factor, and the extra touch of class they add to my glass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218FXFJ00STAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV7J6#wasThisHelpful","R218FXFJ00STAC","A1BJOHHLG0D965","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BJOHHLG0D965?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 17 year old is visiting me, and he has two sets of broken earbuds, so I pulled these out for him to have yesterday.What I like:1.  These have a hard carry case with them to hold them in and protect them2.  The ear piece is cushion-y and fits in your ear like a set of ear plugs, so they sort of mold to fit multiple shapes3.  Great sound quality.4.  Even in the case they are small enough to slide in your pocket!5.  Have a microphone so you can use on the phone or in your game6.  Have button volume controls on the cordThe first thing my son commented on was how much better these earbuds sounded than the inexpensive drug store ones he had been using.  The quality is much better, and I would state it as the quality is right between inexpensive earbuds and a gaming headset.  It is definitely worth paying the extra so you can truly enjoy your music instead of missing out on the different trebles and basses.*******Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review:  All opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion!****","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2UWSIOOWVUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4UQ6U8#wasThisHelpful","R2E2UWSIOOWVUQ","A2TSYGJYBS70I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSYGJYBS70I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this 3 in 1 vacuum cleaner because I have two Akitas.  Akitas are unique in that they don't just shed constantly:  they blow their coat.  There are constantly tumbleweeds of hair everywhere in my house.  Everywhere.  Simply sweeping with a broom, which must be done at least 5 times a day, does not suffice.  No matter how much you sweep, there is hair.  Period.A friend of mine owns a different 3-in-1 Vacuum, but when I came to find it and purchase it, they no longer make the exact model.  I shopped for one based on both price and reviews because I had limited funds to purchase one with.  I am just going to state this simply:  this thing is the best thing I have bought since they started making pre-sliced bread.  It is so great.  The suction is good, I can vacuum a whole room of tumbleweeds before emptying it (normal people can probably get the whole house in before emptying), and I can use it as a vacuum or as a hand vac!I have really tall ceilings in living room, and I cannot reach the tops even standing on a chair.  I use this in vacuum mode and literally roll the walls to vacuum the dust off of the top of the walls and get the dust off.  It is just amazing.  I used it to vacuum my ceiling fans, etc.  I have used this daily for 2 months, emptying it every time I use it, and thus far, I have not had to wash the filter.  All the fur and dust comes right off the filter when you tap it on the trash can, and the suction is as good as day one!The price is so great that even if I only got a year of use out of this (we do have a lot more fur than normal people which might be hard on a motor) it is a great value!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Please note that I have hardwood floors and tile. I do not have carpet anywhere in my home, so I have zero idea how it would work on carpet.  It does work great on furniture, mattresses and even dog beds to get hair, crumbs, and fur off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKA558VNI5HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XOOGUY#wasThisHelpful","RDKA558VNI5HS","A2TSYGJYBS70I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSYGJYBS70I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These globes are each about the size of a golf ball or ping pong ball, and they are so much more lovely than this picture that is very lovely!They are metal, maybe aluminum?  However, I want to point out that these are not flimsy in any way.  While I am sure it is possible to bend them if you work hard enough, they are much sturdier than I expected with a silver metal light.They have a stake where you can put them on the ground, or if you plan to use them indoors, you can just lay the solar panel up on a table outdoors to charge all day long.  They hold up to 8 hours of battery power if they get enough sunlight during the day, and these lights even have an on off button.These are a decent price, and so beautiful that I would not only recommend them, I personally want a few more strands for my personal collection.*****Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review.

" 1:25 Mins This package of socks comes with two pairs of knee high demon socks that are unisex.  They come in various sizes for infant up to age 6, and are exactly as shown here.They are a breathable cotton blend sock, so they are very comfortable.  I like that the top band is thicker than the rest of the sock which really helps hold the sock in place on the leg.  The toe and heel are a different color from the sock itself which adds to the aesthetic quality of the sock, but also makes it easier for little people to put their socks on properly by themselves.  I know my 6 year old son sometimes still puts socks on upside down if there isn't a heel indicator.  Thankfully, these have an indicator!I labeled these as somewhat small, but I am honestly unsure if that is true in most cases.  I say this because we grow large feet here at my home.  My 6 year old son is in the 110% for height so his feet are already a big boy size 5 which I do realize is not typical for a 6 year old boy.  That being said, these run a little small for us, and likely fit perfectly for others.I love that they are knee socks, and I personally would label them monster socks instead of demon socks because there is nothing demonic about them.

The last time I was walking through the house in the dark, tripped over a pair of flip flops and broke my toe.  I have resigned myself to the fact that I need lighting to see to walk at night, and these motion sensor LED wall night lights are just what fits the bill.These didn't come with instructions, so it took me a while to figure out how to get the back of the case off to put in the batteries, but it is sos simple, I almost laughed when I figured it out.  The back literally slides off.  There are two notches, one on either side, and the whole back slides off of those notches.  Easy Peasy.They work very well, when anything walks in front of them, they light up and stay lit for a few seconds in order for you to see where you are going.

"I am a bit of an odd ball.  I keep a string of lights on my foyer table all year round, but I change the lights for the Season or even by the month to fit the decor on the table. When I saw these lights, I knew I had to have them for the Christmas season coming up because they remind me of little snow globes or snow balls.First, let me clarify that these lights are much prettier than the picture even captures.  They are roughly the size of a larger grape, but not the size of a quarter which makes them a great size to either put in a pretty container as the picture shows, or string around a table, over the top of your cabinets in the kitchen, around a table, curtains, or even around a small table top Christmas Tree if you put the battery box at the bottom in the pot that holds the tree.The battery box is super easy to open and does not require a screw driver which is a super plus in my world, and I really like that the lights come with 8 different blinking/shining settings.These are sturdy enough, and they only take 3 C cell batteries.  However, I am headed to the store today to see if I can find that size battery in re-chargeable since we only use re-chargeable batteries here, and it would make it even more cost effective.

"When it comes to cold and cough medicine it is hard to deny that Robitussin is a leader in the industry.  It is so good that my mother who doesn't even believe in medicine relied on this every winter for my cough.  However, what stands out the most in my memory as a child is how awful it tasted!  Sorry, Robitussin, we all know it is true.  The good medicines are rarely known for candy taste.  Instead they are known for how well they work.The great news is this 12 hour cough relief that Robitussin just released is a true 180 from the not so pleasant relief I remember from childhood.  The flavors are now orange and grape.  Both are a vast improvement on the old elixir and the best part is that it works for 12 hours straight.  I hate taking medicine, even pleasant medicine.  However, when I do take it, I want to take it 2 times a day!I am loving this new cough medicine even though I am not loving being sick.***Disclaimer:  I received a free sample from Crowdtap in exchange for review.

"A friend of mine reviewed this as a reviewer months ago, and it has been her go to tab for her kids over the pricier ones she owns ever since  It was her true delight with this product that prompted me to purchase it for my child.The pros of this tablet are that it comes with preloaded educational apps.  If you read about it on the XO website, It is well over $100 in apps that you get with the tablet.  It has space for 4 different user profiles which means one tablet works for all my kids.  My favorite part is that this has a Mommy Mode on it.  I can use this tablet as a regular Android Tablet with no restrictions as a parent!I personally like the jelly sleeve that came on it since it protects it from braking when it drops, and worst case, if it gets broken, it is way less painful than my $300 tablet!

Now this is listed as a potential bath mat, and I don't recommend using it for that.  I didn't even try.  It says to spot wash it with a certain temperature water after vacuuming, so I don't imagine it should be saturated in water if you are to spot wash it.

But are they delicious?  YES!  They are so tasty, like a piece of candy that my son reminds me every morning without fail that he hasn't had his vitamins!Now I would remind people to put up gummy vitamins way high, lock them, whatever, because little ones are going to think ANY gummy brand is tasty like a candy and vitamins are to be consumed at safe doses just like a medicine!

"This is our go to dog food that we use here.  We have two Akitas, so we HAVE to use a grain free food. Akitas have super allergic skin that is prone to hot spots and itchiness and after years of expensive vet visits and prescriptions, we discovered that a grain free food solves Akita skin issues! Now there are cheaper brands of grain free food at your local Walmart or Target, but they are NOT the same.I have tried several cheaper brands, even name brands that are reputable.  However, every single time I use them, the dogs have hot spots after eating one dish of the food, and they eat twice as much of the food.  An immediate indication of a true high protein, grain free food is that your dog will eat at least 1/3 to 1/2 less than they do of what I call ""junk food.""  It's the same as if we eat a high protein, lots of fresh veggie meal compared to fast food burgers and fries! Taste of the Wild is the ""real deal.""My dogs eat much less of this food, have zero issues with their skin, and it is in my opinion as good as the $20-$30 more per bag dog foods you can buy.  I have used the $70 a bag food for my dogs and they did equally as well, but WHY would anyone spend more for dog food if this one is just as good?I recommend Taste of the Wild to everyone I know. My mother in law put her super overweight cat on the cat food Taste of the Wild, and she lost 10 pounds within 6 weeks!  Not only that, but the steroids the doctor prescribed for her skin were no longer needed once the old cat food was  fully out of her system which takes 4-6 full weeks.  All in all we LOVE Taste of the Wild and can't sing it's praises enough!  The price here is the same as it is at my local Tractor Supply store, and I have the convenience of 2 day delivery without having to lift and tote a huge bag of food, so I am loving ordering it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3JRS4UISIVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W5SLB8#wasThisHelpful","RB3JRS4UISIVY","A2TSYGJYBS70I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSYGJYBS70I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that I have an angled brush for eyeliner, two different sized eye shadow brushes, and even a smudge brush to blend. If you prefer a pad applicator, it even has that!  My one complaint is that the brushes refuse to stay in the case even when it is properly tied shut.  They slide out of their compartments and into my makeup bag.  These are truly perfect for my makeup drawer or desk drawer.

"This vibrator is what I would call more than meets the eye.  First of all it takes 2 AAA batteries, and rechargeable batteries work just fine in this toy.  Anyone with a toy collection should definitely invest in rechargeable batteries.  It is the least priciest way of always having batteries on hand that are full powered.This toy has 7 different vibe settings so you can truly tailor it to fit your specific need.  It is a soft body safe silicone which is really important for enjoyment.  As you can see in the picture, the shaft varies in size.  This is a very nice feature because you decide which thickness is perfect.  Also, the bottom 2/3 of the shaft is ridged so it not only vibrates it has added friction.  I personally like this one because it is wider at the tip area than most which is probably my favorite feature.This is super easy to clean, a simple rinse with soap and water, but it is not waterproof to my knowledge so I never get the battery/power end wet.******Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review.

"It is no secret that I go insane over almost all Dead Sea beauty products.  This is for two reasons:  they moisturize better than any I have found, and they smell amazing!  The Spa Gift Baskets by LeliaSea Dead Sea Minerals is no different. I am in love.Fist of all, the Hand, Body, and Foot lotions come in a really cute purple mesh bag with a satin ribbon so they would make the perfect gift for any man or woman.  They are the perfect size to toss in your handbag, keep in your desk drawer, or even in your makeup organizer, but they aren't small enough to minimize the value of the product.The hand lotion is light weight viscosity and absorbs right into the skin.  The Body Lotion is a little thicker and feels quite emollient to touch really moisturizing dry, tired skin.  Now the Foot Lotion is super thick.  This stuff is great to really get to working on worn out calloused feet, really targeting the dry skin, and the scent is calming after a long hard day.My only complaint is size.  Not because this is too expensive for the sizes  I received, but because I love this so much, bigger is going to be better!  Simply adjust the prices as needed.

"We purchased this backpack for my son for school because he is wild about Minions and this was his very favorite one here on Amazon.  I was nervous because this backpack cost a little more compared to the other backpacks, but I know how often character backpacks are more novelty and are cheaply made.I have been nothing but pleased with this backpack.  The zippers on all the compartments are nice metal so they will last longer than a day like the plastic zippers tend to.  Also, it has four separate storage compartments and two mesh bags on either side to hold drinks or other items.The eyeballs section is actually a zipper compartment which is large enough to double as a pencil bag.  It is long enough for pencils and pens, and wide enough to hold a whole pack of colored pencils when they are out of the box. The orange compartment on the front of the bag is about half the size of the eyeball bag, and we use this to hold a snack since it is just the right size.The bag itself has two compartments:  one larger, one smaller so it truly has room for whatever you need.  My son carries his 3 ring binder in the smaller compartment, and puts his coat in the other compartment when he takes it off in the mornings.Last but not least, the little Despicable Me 2 tag on the front of the backpack makes Minion giggles and sounds.

"I am going to upfront admit that I am always skeptical when it comes to online jewelry purchases. It seems it can sometimes be a 50:50 chance you are taking on getting either great quality or a really cheap imitation piece of jewelry.I was so pleasantly surprised by this jewelry, I told my sister about it so she can purchase some for her daughter and husband for Holiday.  These crosses are made of sturdy stainless steel, and the chains are not only longer than typically comes with a pendant, but they are not made so flimsy that you can break them with your hands.The black gold and rose gold finish adds to the beauty of the pendants, and isn't flaking off as some cheap overlays are.  The stainless steal wedding bands or halos are an added pop of color as well as signifying eternity with the circle never ending.The only thing I wish were an added option would be an option of a longer chain for extra cost.  My husband has a very large neck so being able to purchase additional length would be nice.

"Vast improvement on the unmoldable mouth guard tooth whiteners from 20 years back.These are individually wrapped tooth whitening strips for daily use.  It comes with enough for 28 days, and each package has a smaller strip for the bottom teeth and a larger strip for the top teeth.It took me a couple of uses to figure out exactly how to use these.  That is likely a user issue, but I found that taking a dry towel and wiping as much moisture off my teeth as possible before application helped a lot.  Also, as I apply the strip I rub up and down/all over each tooth to make sure it adheres before I tuck it over the teeth to secure.  Otherwise, the bleach will leak out of the strip, and while I am sure it isn't 100% toxic, I am uncomfortable swallowing it.My 20 year coffee habit means my teeth need all 28 uses, but after a week, it appears to be lightening my teeth a bit.

"This is a great MP3/MP4 player for kids, teens, parents, and even someone who is technologically challenged.  I say this because while it can be used as a simple MP3 Player, it is also a voice recorder, Video Player, Audio Player, Photo Viewer, Ebook Reader, Games, and movies.

At under $35 for this large capacity of data storage, it is less expensive than my off brand just a MP3 player I gave my daughter for last Christmas.

"This is a must have in any technologically forward home in my opinion.  With 3 cell phones, 3 Mp3 players, 2 cameras, and even portable power banks that require charging on a daily basis, a multi-slat tower stand cuts out the frustration from lack of enough power outlets.  It also drastically cuts down on your interaction with the powering process.What I mean is I don't have to come back in 4-6 hours to swap out products for charging.  This tower allows me to charge 5 of any USB port compatible products at one time.  I put five products on, go to bed, and everything is magically fully charged in the am.  Things like tablets that are used after school go on the charger during the day, and taken off when the kids arrive home in the evenings.My favorite part is the chip that is inside this to detect which product is charging so that each product gets the right amount of amps.

"This is our go to brand of dog food, and this bag was the great quality we expected it to be.  We own two full-blooded Akita's so a grain-free dog food is mandatory due to their severe sensitivity to anything else causing bad hot spots.But based on how our dogs react, it isn't just quality, it tastes good too.  They were sniffing the box it came in excitedly, and I had to be careful not to cut noses as I was opening it because they couldn't wait to get it!While many would consider this expensive, I can attest first hand that dogs eat far less quantity of this food then they do the grocery store fast food/junk food quality food.  My dogs were eating a minimum of 3-4 quarts of food each daily of the grocery store brands, but they eat a quart-two quarts of this a day each.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K22TUNNXGFVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W5U5H6#wasThisHelpful","R1K22TUNNXGFVG","A2TSYGJYBS70I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSYGJYBS70I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is always a good idea to have a manual coffee grinder around along with a French press so that in the event of power outages and other unforeseen problems, you can still enjoy your morning cup of coffee.I really like this coffee grinder because it is all stainless steel instead of stainless steel and glass.  Glass is just a hazard in my house.  I do own glass items, but it seems I am forever dropping things, and something that requires me to hold onto it and grind away needs to be me proof.This is by far the sturdiest manual grinder I have seen before, and definitely sturdier than the other one I own.  It has a nice capacity container both to hold the beans and to hold the grounds, and the turn arm is very sturdy.  The arm is also ergonomically positioned to be more comfortable to turn.It completely comes apart to be washed in hot soapy water, and I really love that it isn't a plain but contains a really cute tractor!  Cute and functional gets my vote over plain functional any day!******Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review.

"This is a basic makeup tool kit that is perfect for your handbag, desk at work, glove compartment, gym bag, or any place you might need to touch up your makeup.  It is also a good beginner set if like me you have a 12 year old daughter who keeps stealing, I mean borrowing your brushes.What I like:1.  Metal Cylinder for neat carrying to keep the brushes clean as well as keep everything it touches from getting makeup dust on it2.  Comes with 5 basic brushes3.  Brush handles are made of metal not cheap plastic4.  Bristles are soft not hard like inexpensive brushes can be.This set comes with the following brushes:* Angled Brush* Shadow Brush* Shading brush* Eye liner brush* Smudge BrushI wish the case weren't just solid plain, black.

"I have been using Garcinia Cambogia for a few months now to boost my metabolism, give me energy, and of course help lose weight.  What I love about this particular brand is that it contains 95% so it is the highest percentage.  While my body certainly didn't grow completely immune to the other brand, it had gotten quite used to the % I was taking, so increasing the percentage has been positive.  I definitely felt the energy increase which means my metabolism is higher too.I would say this is for the Garcinia Cambogia regular user, and I had no negative side effects that can come with a metabolism boost sometimes such as dizziness or rapid heartbeat.  I do want to state that I haven't found this to be a miracle cure for losing weight (any brand) but I love the energy I get with this, and I do lose weight slowly.No negatives on this one.

"My husband has permanent damage to his leg due to a bad burn years back, and while undergoing pain management, the doctor suggested he take Glucosamine Chondroitin since it helps a lot of people and couldn't hurt  Now, while it didn't solve my  husband's issues, I started taking it since I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I have to say it has become something I have continued taking the last few years.I love how as it built up and is in my system that it feels like my joints received a much needed lube job.  It really helps me with my stiffness, joint pain, and the overall well being of my knees, fingers, and other joints.  Additionally, my chronic back pain  has become bearable on a daily basis with flareups every so often.  I am unsure if there is a link to my back pain and Glucosamine Chondroitin, but I do like how good I feel now.I like that Pinnacle Nutrition includes MSM in their blend which really sets them apart from many competitor brands.  I switched brands when I received this bottle and I have been well pleased with the results.  The price is great for 150 pills so it lasts more than a month.The only thing I would change about these supplements is the size.  I think they are rather large for swallowing.  I personally have zero issues swallowing any size pill, but my mother cannot swallow them because they are too big.

"I had a severe case of MRSA 12 years ago, so months of antibiotics I received intravenously at the hospital because you couldn't buy them at the pharmacy left my good bacteria and gut health less than zero.  It actually took me a few years to put two and two together and realize that was why I was getting sick and infections all the time.However, the only option back then that I was aware of was yogurt and other cultured foods.  While I still eat those, the type of issues I was having weren't repaired overnight with a cup of yogurt a day.Probiotics have been a breath of fresh air.  Complete Probiotic by Pinacle Nutrition are formulated to last 8x longer than most probiotics which means the probiotics stay live and active a lot longer so I know I am taking a supplement that really gets in my body and starts fighting.  I was worried with my kids starting back to school because this typically means I get sick as a dog from the germs they bring home but seem to be immune to.  Read:  They are healthy as a horse, but I catch everything going around and then some.I have been taking this probiotic the whole month, and I am thrilled to say that my yearly sick month has been relatively sick free.  These probiotics aren't a miracle cure and won't keep you from EVER getting ill, but they definitely boosted my healthy bacteria so I can better fight off illness!  The price is reasonable, and it comes with a full money back guarantee so there is literally nothing to lose.The pill size is a good size to swallow, and it is only 2 pills a day so I give it a five star review.******Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review.

"I got this dress with the intention of my daughter wearing this because she typically wears a women's medium, and a sweater elastic dress is perfect to wear to school with leggings and chucks.The good things about this dress are that it fits to size, and is made of a quality tight knit so that it won't snag on every single thing. She is only about five feet tall so this dress comes on her calf instead of ending on her thigh so it is great for petite people, but it will definitely fit longer.To note, this is  not a 3/4/ length sleeve, this is a full length sleeve, but it does have the huge cowl neckline, and if you want no cleavage it is perfect to pair with a camisole or tank top.I do wish this were a shorter dress, because it looks best as an above the knee dress as it would be on taller people, and I can't simply hem it since it is knit material.

"My favorite part of this Mp3/Mp4 player is that it has a rubber back for the case. This adds a layer of protection in case the player gets dropped.It comes with 8gb of storage for your music, but it also has a slot for a 32gb Micro SD Card so it really holds way more music.It also connects to FM radio so you can listen to your favorite radio station, and it has voice recording so you can record your important thoughts on the go.It comes with a really nice set of ear buds, and a sling with the Lonve logo on it.  The sound quality is really nice on this Mp3 player, and it has a speaker on the back of the player.

"My husband has to have these stretchy diabetic socks because his legs and feet swell due to working on the 12 hours a day often 7 days straight before he gets a day off.  I have purchased other brands in the past, but the price was great for these so I decided to give these a try.I am super impressed.  The sock itself is thick, cushioned, and super soft while the ankle portion is a thinner, stretchy cotton material.  I love that they are made stretchy so they fit his ankles and legs as they swell, but when I take them off, they conform back to their original size.

"List of things I love about Sun Essential Geranium Leaf Oil:1.  Amber glass bottle to protect the oil from sunlight and oxygen.2.  For all appearances, this is a pure oil.  A regular oily person can readily discern if an oil has been cut with a carrier oil, and in my opinion this brand has not been.3.  Smells amazing, and has many versatile uses!  I especially love difusing, adding to my homemade candles and soaps.  However, a simple search can tell you how to safely use this oil.4.  LARGE quantity for a very reasonable price.  This makes this a perfect oil to splurge on such as diffusing in my electric diffuser!I would add a stopper top to this bottle so that one drop at a time can be shaken out.  This is the only thing I wish were different. I prefer to use the shaker method 90% of the time that I use oils because I put one drop right on my finger and administer that way.  The dropper still works fine, I just wish there was the inner top.****Disclaimer:  I received sample in exchange for review.

"I like that this Battery Case/ Power Bank is exactly what it says it is.  It is created to fit the iPhone 5/5s perfectly complete with a dock that the phone slides perfectly on.  This works as easy as it says it does.  You simply slide the cover off of the battery of your phone, and slide this case/power bank on the phone making sure it connects properly.  The power cord then connects to the case and can be powered by either your usb adapter, or the wall.I really like that this case extends the life of the battery power on my phone so that if I am not receiving great reception, my battery doesn't drain immediately.  It also has prevented the need to power up mid-day and lasts until I get home in the evening.All of the cut outs are accurate to the phone and allow for the camera lens to work properly, and I am overall pleased with this power case.The only negative I have to state is the plastic wrap that was encasing the clear plastic box had been completely detached at the opening, but the product itself has zero scratches and doesn't look like it was used in any way.

I know they work.  I have many friends who use them with their babies and they really seem to help.2.  They come with a certificate of Authenticity.  I know these are REAL Baltic Amber which is important.  Not only would fake ones probably not work, we want to know we are using the best product on our babies!3.  Easy to put on because they screw apart and screw on.  Easy Peasy.4.  Price is really good for these.  I priced them in the past for my MIL and all the brands I priced were WAY more expensive.  Under $20 is always a plusI feel the need to point out to take these off at sleeping times if you put them on your little one.

"This is my first time using a manual grinder for coffee, but I have been really wanting one and I am here to share my thoughts on this one after using it.What I like:1.  I like the slim size.  This makes it perfect for me to use at home, but also perfect to take on a camping trip, to the hotel room so I can make my own coffee, pretty much anywhere.  It is small enough to be convenient.2.  I like the green aspect of this product.  It is extremely convenient to always use electric, but in our house we try to be as eco friendly as is possible, and hand grinding fits the bill for us.3.  I like that it is a good emergency tool too.  Remember the last time you were without power for a storm, or whatever reason?  No hot coffee.  Well, I use a French Press which merely needs boiling water (I boil mine on the grill when we are in a power outage) and this grinder will effectively give you fresh, coffeehouse coffee even in the barest of situations!4.  I like that it has a hand crank and not just a twist and turn like a pepper grinder has.  It's nice to be able to use the handle.5.  It is very much like my pepper grinder in that you take the screw off, take off the clear plastic lid and fill will beans.  Screw back on and turn.6.  It gives my upper arms a nice little workout!  It isn't an exchange for the gym, but my arms feel it in a good way.7.  It was fun.  My kids were each bugging to get a chance to help me grind the coffee beans.  While I am sure the novelty will wear off, it is definitely a chore you can safely assign a 6 year old!What I wish were different:1. It only held two handfuls of beans in the grinder section of the canister.  In other words,  I need to refill the top part to get more than an 8 Demitasse cup (3 coffee mugs) of grounds.  This would take away from how convenient and portable it is, so there is a give and take with this idea.2.  It seems like a lot of work to grind the coffee.  This one, I am unsure there is a fix for, other than mindset.  Honestly, we live in a FAST, NOW, YESTERDAY society that wants the fastest solution to everything.  However, with a manual solution, It's as fast as your arms and hands work, so this is relative.  I just mentioned this because it does take a few more minutes than an electric grinder.The pics below include some text so that you can see how easy this is.*******Disclaimer:  I received product at a promotional rate in exchange for review.

"With so many people in our family, it seems we own almost every brand and design of the latest and greatest phones, so I am always on the hunt for accessories such as this Cloak for the Galaxy S6.

This is a quality case that is at a promotional rate, and you get the quality product at a great price.2.  It is crystal clear.  I love that it keeps my phone looking just like my phone, but protects it all the same.3.  It is made out of a sturdy, bendable plastic-y material.  Ok here's the skinny:  Hard brittle cases tend to crack easily. In my opinion the give of the plastic is what makes it protect this phone so well.4;  All of the cut outs align perfectly.  The buttons work well with the case on, the camera has perfect clearance. It was made for this phone.5.  It has a metal frame that goes around the clear plastic case.  You won't see it on your phone, at least I don't, but it adds an extra layer of support to keep your phone safe.6.  Lifetime Warranty.  Hey, anything that comes with a lifetime warranty is awesome.  It protects my investment.7.  It comes with a screen protector that protects the screen from scratches.8.  It comes with two cleaning cloths.  It's like this company thought of everything when they created this product.The only thing I would change at all is that I would like this in a jelly type material option especially for my more accident prone kids.

"My 6 year old son loves everything about these pills.  First of all, they aren't pills.  They are round, but smaller than a tic tac, and they melt on his tongue if he doesn't chew them so I don't believe a child would choke on them.  This is important to any mom!  It is also almost every allergen free.  I say almost just to cover me, but honestly, it is free of anything additive.The only thing in this that I am iffy on for a child is the Stevia, but I know first hand my son would NOT eat these if they weren't a bit sweet.

"I don't typically enjoy too much Sci Fi, either in film or book, but this had a great story line.  It contains a love story between a human and someone from another planet, delicious sex scenes, and an ending that concludes the story but leaves the door wide open for the next book!

"This book was a yes for me.  I want to explain that there were some technical issues with the book.  For example, it switched narration which took away from some of the suspense of the book in my opinion, and the main character seemed to be everything her description said she wasn't.  That being said, she was still quite interesting.This was a great read.  It had romance, super powers (we love powers). Fighting Demons and much more.

"I use this in my Vagabond. Surprisingly, the thicker papers, like a 100lb or more, are the ones that can tear through with this folder. I'm still working on the perfect sandwich for using it with a thicker cardstock, but it's worth the effort. I'd like to get the most 3-D effect as possible without my paper looking as if it was die cut. ;)It's actually a challenge to find the perfect sandwich, and not always as easy as following someone else's suggestions. Things such as how worn your cutting plates are, slight differences in pressure between machines, the type/brand of cardstock used, whether you use an impression pad or just extra paper as a shim... yeah, it's definitely something you want to practice on your cheaper paper first.

"I love being able to purchase the refills for my Tsukineko ink pads. The Brilliance Moonlight White is not as opaque as, let's say, the Hero Arts Unicorn... BUT it is great for doing a Bokeh effect where you can stencil it on and apply it a little more generously. Since it's a pigment ink, it does need some drying time.

"I have a collection of glue runners, tapes, adhesives, glue dots, foam tape... basically anything you can imagine for getting two items to stick together. I was looking for a more cost efficient product than the *red* tapes I've used in the past, of which I've purchased 3 brands. All three were roughly $5 for 15-18 feet. This seemed to be an awesome deal for two rolls at $10 for 54 yards in total. I've used this Scor-Tape several times since receiving it a couple of weeks ago and I'm not impressed at all. I don't use my red tape for just anything... only for specific items that need a seriously strong hold. This tape does not give me the same results. It provides about the same tension hold as my Scotch ATG gun. Yes, it's easy to tear, but that's about all I find great about it. I wonder if I got a lemon, seeing all the excellent reviews and comparisons to the *red* tapes? If the second roll provides better results, I will update my review.Update, Oct. 9: Well, it seems I jumped the gun before giving this tape a fair chance. I've used about half of the roll and now find myself going for it a LOT. It DOES hold better than I initially thought, but I didn't find this out until I tried to reposition a few things after using it. It holds. It holds well. I like it well enough now that I went ahead and purchased the 1"" size, which is great for using to apply glitter or foil to die cuts. I'm thinking about getting the 6x6"" sheets, too.

"Chalk it up to an incomplete item description (and a borderline aggressive seller that passes the buck. Hint: not prime)... but this is NOT the so-very-popular Hero Arts WHITE embossing powder that crafters love because it's considered to be one of the best white embossing powders.

But, my fellow crafty crafter, don't be tricked and duped into buying a clear that you most likely already have a ton of, like me. When I purchased this in July of 2015, nowhere, in any of the three areas of listed information, did it say ""Clear""... only Ultra Fine... and as most crafters know, ultra fine comes in many colors.

"I gave this cardstock three stars because it's just okay. There was no cover weight listed in the description, so I was hoping that it would be at least an 80lb cover weight since it was titled ""Premium."" Nope. I can't say exactly what the cover weight might be, but I can say it's definitely not more than 65lb... and that's being generous. The color is odd. It appears to be a faded black, not a smooth consistent grey. It's hard to explain... but when the description reads: ""12x12 inch solid-colored cardstock"", then I'm thinking it's going to be smooth.... not going to have an obvious texture. I am having a hard time finding a heavier, smooth, grey cardstock! If you know of a good one, then please comment and let me know!Update: I've bumped it up a star. While I was't initially impressed, it's a pretty good paper. What I've decided that I like about it is that one side has a slight texture and the other side is pretty smooth. It IS a good paper, just not as thick as I was hoping.

"I didn't like this bathing suit because I followed the size chart and it was way too big. Plus, as any woman with a cup size of C or more will tell you, we need support! The straps, while looking really good on the model, did nothing to support my D cups. Nothing. I was slipping out of the bottom or squeezing out of the top, depending on how I tried to arrange it. There really should be a firm cup, if not an underwire, at this price point. Even though the straps gaped on my back and wouldn't lay flat, no matter how far I tried to pull the bottom down, they still dug into my shoulders. The waist area did not look flattering. It wasn't tight enough, but still managed to pucker in, in between my waist and hips, creating a very lumpy look. I also didn't like how tight it was around my legs. I was quite surprised the hip/leg was so tight. My reflection looked like: Convex, concave, convex with loose material, concave, pudge, roll, weird pucker, and finally, leg pudge being squeezed some more.On a positive note... it really made my tush look good. Somehow it managed to give it a good lift. I'm sure this would be a great bathing suit for others, and quite possibly another size might have remedied some of the issues I had, but I am returning it instead of hassling with an exchange.

"I am an avid fan of the World of Wool. After reading the Wool series, I began reading all the fan fiction I could find. I came across this one, and at the time it had seven 5-star reviews. Well, it turns out that all the reviews were by readers that were previous fans of the author, and didn't seem to be originally searching for Wool fan fiction. Now, I really feel bad leaving a two star review, just because it takes talent to be able to write, which is something I've never attempted. But the purpose of a review is to give an opinion, good or bad. Let me start out with the good: She obviously can write. She created characters that were well developed, and I found myself wanting to find out what would happen between them. The love story itself was sweet.The BAD: It's as if someone told her about Wool and then she decided to write what she thought would fit into this world. If there were cliff notes on Wool, I'd believe that she had read the first line of each page. I realize this sounds so critical, but seriously... Her story does not belong in the Wooliverse. It doesn't. Not at all. It's almost insulting how she took Hugh Howey's storyline and changed it to something completely, utterly, different. There were NOT 1000 silos!!!!!!! It can't even begin to relate to his storyline, just on the basis of Silo 1's involvement. Plus, it's just simply, completely unbelievable. In her story, she claims that each silo's population had to be kept at 1,000. So, she's just taken Hugh Howey's original storyline and changed it from 50 silos, with about 10,000 (max) people in each silo, to 1,000 silos with each silo having only 1,000 people.  I also thought the idea of children being raised by their parents for the first 5 years, then being sent to a ""dormitory"" with other children to learn silo survival completely far-fetched. First, how the heck would there be enough children to warrant a dormitory if there were only 1,000 residents to begin with? There's no mention of how the parents would react to this either. Oh, but then several years later, those kids/strangers are sent back to their parents until they finish shadowing. So, a nurse, shadowing, would live with their parents until their mid twenties, while a farmer might live on their own by 14. Also, the author has changed the storyline to include ""trips"" to other silos. Complete malarkey. She writes that there are 1,000 silos, all in communication with each other, and they have to do what the other silos want in order to not be ostracized from the other NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE silos. Ostracized from what? They're in self-contained silos! She writes that these 1,000 use ""sanctioned trips from silo to silo, trading residents for residents, or goods for goods."" No. Uh-uh. I don't even want to get started on silo 1000's neighbor. It's annoying and unbelievable.Oh, and the people who have to clean? Supposedly, they're like zombies after they get outside. Even though they're dead, their muscle memory keeps them up and walking around, doing things they did in the silo. THIS IS THE ENTERTAINMENT for the residents of the silo. This is what they watch on the viewing screens, as if it's funny or a running series on TV. Yuck. Oh, and if one of these zombies comes back inside the silo, then they crumble to ash when exposed to the silo air. Someone tried it because they wanted the zombie as a pet or something... tried to put them on a leash. **eye roll** This make NO SENSE. So... the air outside is toxic, but it's not toxic enough to eat through or break down the human body? Just a incredibly slow disintegration of the flesh which literally takes decades sometimes? Oh... and never once does she mention the nanotechnology, which is the entire basis of the original story in relation to the cleanings and what happens when people go outside. *SMH* This fact alone is one of the bigger glitches is her story. The NANOTECHNOLOGY. The good nanos, the bad nanos... it's not a WOOl story if it doesn't have the nanos! Lol... I'm feeling a little hyped up here. ;)She also writes about ""condos"" as living quarters. Supposedly, in her 1,000 silo world, the silos were originally built with different housing sizes (some large and lush) and who lived in these was determined by class. I just can't even believe she read WOOL! If she had, then she would have known that it went into depth about the architecture and the plans and how everything is the same between every silo. There were different sized units, due to single people vs. those with families (both still SMALL) which was planned, but no way would a ""condo"" fit into the storyline. I find it insulting to Hugh Howey by changing the main points; the basis; the roots; the everything of what made ""silo life"" silo life. While some fan fiction has included an elevator that was put in for a reason (and in a more believable manner,) this author did it in a way that just left me shaking my head. Anyone could use this elevator if it were available. People also wore clothing that showed off their ""naked"" legs, but would be sent out to clean for an unsanctioned kiss. Really? People were given the choice to wear whatever they wanted (""sleeveless shirt and cut-off pants"") yet they'd be sent to clean for a kiss? There was also concern of ""a rat gnawing at wires."" Huh? If there had been a rat in the original silo, the silo would never have lasted. Those things reproduce prolifically, and would have destroyed the silo pretty quickly. Overall, there were just so many things that contradicted what Hugh Howey set up in his story, that I simply didn't like it being called fan fiction. If this book had been presented as it's own idea, and not fan fiction, I would have been able to give a higher rating. But, it doesn't belong within the well-loved idea of life in the ""Wooliverse"" as a ""Siloan"" or ""Silozen"" would have lived... or died... and then stayed dead.I think she should retitle this book. I wouldn't recommend this to another true fan of WOOL. While her writing, in and of itself, was fine (I'll even say very good!) she should stick with romance writing and stay out of the Wooliverse.... unless she wants to play in this playground by the *acceptable* rules. Kind of easy: There are 50 Silos. People die when they go outside... and they don't walk around while dead. A trip to another silo is not something done casually, even with some sort of ""sanctioning."" This is harsh, I know... but when she took the premise of Wool and made such gargantuan changes, it was almost as if she was spitting in Hugh Howey's face.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3M5PL16YS0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFNOSAK#wasThisHelpful","R2G3M5PL16YS0S","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tsukineko's Pico Embellishers are wonderful! The needle tip allows for such precise application. Inside the cap is another, smaller needle that prevents it from getting clogged. Be careful not to bend it when putting the cap back on! I love how the colors match the ink pads, also. It's a lot thinner than Stickles, and slightly thinner than Glossy Accents. It dies evenly, without cracking, and leaves a beautiful shine. I've purchased this one (Danube Blue), Cottage Ivy, Angel Pink, Clear, Rose Bud, and Shimmer. The Shimmer is the only one that isn't perfect due to the air bubbles created when it's shaken. These are addicting! Perfect for flowers, adding dimension to ""water"" on cards, and even lettering, just to name a few things it can be used for.

"I have six colors in the Pico Embellishers, but this is the only one I have with shimmer. While every other color is awesome, amazing, beautiful and fun, this one is a little more tedious due to the fact that it has to be shaken, repeatedly, during use. All the shimmer will settle at the bottom in between uses and it takes a LOT of shaking to get it completely incorporated. The reason I knocked off two stars is because of the air bubbles. It's not like one can wait for the bubbles to go away, because by then the shimmer is settling at the bottom again. I still like it, but it's a hassle trying to pop all those little bubbles. It helps to ""prime"" it on a scrap piece of paper, but there will still be bubbles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34L46I3RR9QTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV0M6TI#wasThisHelpful","R34L46I3RR9QTO","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Neenah Classic Crest Solar White in the 110# cover weight at the same time I purchased this. This paper is advertised as 270gsm, but I have a difficult time believing it. While it's nice, it's quite the difference... and there shouldn't be a big difference between a 100# and a 110# cover. The Neenah is 279gsm, so a difference of only 9gsm is not much at all. {{{{{{{{{While this would be absolutely perfect for invitations, it just doesn't have that super-heavy cardstock feel that a lot of card makers like as a card base.}}}}}}} I've actually bumped it up to 5 stars, but I'd really give it 4.5 if I could. So, while it's a beautiful paper, and the speckles give it a unique feel, it's just shy of being a true heavy-weight cardstock. I really hate to sound like some kind of paper snob, but I was hoping for something like the Bazzill heavyweight cardstock in peanut cluster, which is a 100# cover weight also... and now that I think about it, this is definitely nowhere near as heavy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C2UY6F34RU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWG7FTU#wasThisHelpful","R3C2UY6F34RU2","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For any newbies or inexperienced crafters in regards to dry ink pads. Please let me fill you in on a tip so you don't waste your money or pads like I did. I had to learn the hard way. If you are using a dye or alcohol ink, this is exactly what you need: FELT. BUT, if you are using a thicker ink such as pigment, embossing, or reflective, or any thicker specialty ink... get the FOAM pad. These are great pads, as long as you are using them with the right inks. I read a couple of reviews that stated the top didn't seem like real felt, which I agree with, but it is a sturdy type of cotton cloth... for lack of a better description. Either way, it's a great way to get your own color combination with thinner inks. Or a cheaper alternative for when refill bottles are on clearance, which is actually what I did. This pad was $3, and the refill bottle was $1, so for $4 I had the same pad as the $13 labeled pad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWK8WMYE3XLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O5SODU#wasThisHelpful","R3DWK8WMYE3XLR","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this set. It's just what you'd expect for a stamp and die set. BUT, the only thing I don't like it how the dies are actually quite hard to line up over the stamped image. This is why I deducted one star. It's difficult to line some of them up because of the embossing portion of the metal die that blocks the image. I will definitely still use it. I just have to take those few extra moments of guesswork. Some of them looked great after stamping, cutting, and embossing... while a few made me scratch my head thinking how had I gotten it twisted? Or was it supposed to look like that? lol... I may just skip the embossing next time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJPLA3FRNS32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YM1MUO#wasThisHelpful","R2WJPLA3FRNS32","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautifully intricate die set that makes an A2 card go from ""nice"" to ""WOW!"" There are many combinations with these four dies. Because this is such an intricate set of dies, I've learned a few tricks to make them a lot easier to use. First, I use wax paper between the die and the cardstock. Secondly, I use the Spellbinders Craft Tool N' One to get all the little pieces out very quickly. Let me tell you... I didn't think this little tool would be all that, BUT IT IS! For dies like these, it's invaluable.Back to the dies, though.For embossing with my Vagabond, I run the die through as I would any standard die, then I flip it over while my cardstock is still in the die and sandwich it as follows: Solo platform with solo shim, acrylic plate, cardstock in die with cutting edge UP, Sizzix silicone rubber mat, and lastly, the Sizzix impressions pad. The embossing is subtle on any paper that has a print on it, but it really stands out on solid paper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396XSZFIDBO3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HP10LCO#wasThisHelpful","R396XSZFIDBO3L","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These three cloud dies have gotten more use than I ever imagined I would use them for. They cut cleanly every time. I really like the fact that they're not straight along the bottom, too. With a quick swipe of light blue, grey, or silver along the bottom, you've got yourself a beautiful puff of a cloud. They can also be used to make a tree: Simply cut out the trunk of a tree, then layer the clouds (cut from green card stock) where you'd put leaves, and viola!... You've got a tree at the height of the season.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37238X7AGE6PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW2A4OO#wasThisHelpful","R37238X7AGE6PS","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love VersaFine for embossing highly detailed stamps. It's the only embossing ink I've found that gives consistently clean and crisp results with a fine embossing powder. I use it with any images that have a LOT of fine details and also any sentiment stamps that are small or when the font is close together. It also lasts longer than other pigment inks and you don't have to worry about promptly closing it to prevent the ink from drying out.

"First off, if you want to have any success at all with the smaller banners, don't even try them without wax paper. Also, don't get your hopes up that the dots will pop out without a fight. Be prepared with all your tricks and secret tools because you're going to need them. The stripes and chevron patterns work a little better, and there's no issues at all with the biggest, open banners. Hopefully, they're not all like this, and maybe my set just doesn't cut as deeply as intended.Update: One trick that I've recently found is to take a metal tip (I use a tool for pottery that looks like a metal pencil with a needle on the end) or anything hard enough that won't be damaged by the edges of the metal dies, and I rub it over the entire area, such as the dots, AFTER I've run it through my die cutter, but before I remove the paper from the die. This ""cuts"" through any of the areas that didn't cut cleanly in my machine. I wish I didn't have to hassle with it at all, but it's a way to get the dots and stripes out of the smaller banners, instead of them never being used at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R269X96AKGTOA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IH1OSNY#wasThisHelpful","R269X96AKGTOA5","A2AEQSSI637PJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AEQSSI637PJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the idea of waterproof Phone Cases. I have tried the vinyl waterproof cases. I really like this iPhone case. It is very sturdy. It comes nicely boxed and would make a great gift for someone who has the iPhone 6. My son has dropped his phone in the water while fishing several months ago. This is a perfect case for him to use while he is out on the boat or fishing.I have to say I am afraid to submerge it in water with the iPhone phone inside. I did test it by putting it under water and no water went inside the case. It does protect it from water. It comes with a little key shaped screwdriver to open the case and close it back up. That makes it nice and secure inside so no water will damage your phone. I received this case complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.

"We look with amazement upon this volume.  How can Eric Flint still, after so many books, continue to interest and entertain us?  Well, he has a knack for creating characters that we enjoy spending time with.  Some people I think consider  these book to be a kind of action thriller.  But not so.  They are full of economics and social history-every bit as much as a heroic shoot'um up.  There are some good battle action but not as much and not as close in as in some of the other books.  Flint has a large cast to work with, all of whom are worth spending time with.  I like the inter action among them which Flint uses to explain the obscure to most Americans social and political situation in the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania in that era.  Flint manages to introduce the context of the culture with gentle guidance.  His over arching theme of a broken Europe, a Europe twisted and distorted by the history of Germany, is one that I find insightful.  I want to read this book and his others because they are just fun to read, to enjoy, to relax and enter another world for a little while.  But I appreciate Flint's work because of what I learn in terms of history, economics, invention and historical social realities.  I can't wait for the next volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEVCPWH5CK0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AP945WA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEVCPWH5CK0Y","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Carol has created a work of deep scholarship in ""From Jerusalem to the Lion of Judah and Beyond"".  So deep that the last third of the book, very nearly, is taken up with foot notes, appendixes and citations.  But the body of the work is crammed full of not simply data stacked upon data but insight as well.  I knew that Idi Amin of Uganda proudly wore Israeli paratrooper wings but I didn't know that the fraud never made a jump.  Some details are utterly fascinating, like the troubles of Ethiopian fisherman in adapting to modern methods taught by Israelis.  Other facts cause a tightening of various body parts.  The long, disconnected and complicated history of helping the lost Jews of Ethiopia count here.  Dr. Carol covers East Africa from the first days of Israel's engagement to the connections with the new nation of South Sudan.

"Mr. Froczyk has managed to combine an astonishingly detailed, day by day telling of the first two years of WWII in the East with such compelling prose that it almost seems like a thriller.  I have read widely on matters WWII for 50 years but never have I received such a comprehensive telling of this story.  We learn just how effective the generalship of the German war machine was in the first two years, and how astonishingly incompetent the Communists were.  But at very great cost, the Soviets learned the hard lessons and threw up leaders who could stand against the Nazis.  From a human perspective, this is a tale of absolute horror.  From a distance of more than 70 years, it makes a fascinating read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RH7L0UD7MQI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781590087#wasThisHelpful","R1RH7L0UD7MQI4","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Movie Review by Andy McKinneyThe 33 How hard is it to make a real life drama about an event that the whole world knows about?  How hard to make a film about a story familiar to every one and make it not simply interesting to watch but to make it mesmerizing to the audience?  I'd say about as hard as granite or maybe as hard as the rocks in a Chilean mine.  But Mexican born film director Patricia Riggen does just that.  ""The 33"" is quite simply wonderful film making. I am sure you remember the true life events depicted in the movie.  A cave-in in a deep rock mine in Chile trapped 33 miners deep underground.  They remained trapped for 69 days.  The whole world watched and waited along with the loved ones of the miners, hoping and praying for a successful rescue. While still underground the miners themselves agreed with one another to produce a single voice to the world after rescue and to share equally in any proceeds.  The men knew that they would be famous.  The book on their trials, ""Deep Down Dark"" became the basis of the film.  In spite of five different pens having a share in the script the power of the story comes through in the movie.  We get to know several of the miners well enough to root for their rescue.  One poor guy, the real life Carlos Mamani, was a Bolivian, a foreigner and an Indian, separated by nationality and race and on his first day on the job, friendless and utterly alone. Others among the miners included an alcoholic who could just barely function, a young new father, a Christian who served as the spiritual hub for the trapped men and their leader who became known as 'Super' Mario.  Even though we know the outcome, we sit enthralled as they struggle to survive starvation and madness deep beneath the earth. A big big tip of the hat must go to director Paticia Riggen for her management of this project.  She doesn't do anything flashy, no clever director tricks to distract us.  She lets her players tell the story, the upper story of the family members and rescuers and the lower story of the men trapped with only a few pitiful cans of tuna to sustain them. The cast members, starting with Antonio Banderas as 'Super' Mario, the natural leader of the men, do a great job of showing the strain on the trapped miners as human beings in a very tough spot.  Many of the cast members are from South America but you might have seen Rodrigo Santoro, a Brizilian actor who played the Chilean Minister of Mines.  Besides Bandaras other familier faces  include Lou Diamond Philips as a miner and Gabriel Byrne and James Brolin as rescuers.  French actress Juliette Binoche plays the sister of a miner and represents the frantic family members of the lost men.  You will recognize long time character actor Bob Gunton who plays the president of Chile. This movie satisfies on every level.  The above average four saw blade film runs a good long two hours and seven minutes.  In spite of its very serious theme it carries a mild PG-13 rating. ""The 33"" was filmed in Columbia and Chile.  The opening shots of the stark landscapes of the Chilean dessert show a kind of very hard beauty.  This very well done film took in only $6 million in the USA over the opening week end but world wide box office of $18.5 helps the producers make back the $26 million budget.  The producers should be rewarded for making this superior film and I think they will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R219EJNO4MU6SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017Y3936W#wasThisHelpful","R219EJNO4MU6SF","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This third volume picks up the story of the time lost West Virginians and the Germany of the 30 years war.  The plot is active with lots of different story lines running simultaneously.  We have a large cast of characters, some from our time and some from the year 1634.  Eric Flint has the wonderful ability to create characters that have such authenticity that we believe in them.  They have such warmth as people that we want to be with them, to share their journey and walk for a while in their presence.  Flint is a great story teller with an imagination strong enough to take us along with him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FBNGGRVIQBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416555889#wasThisHelpful","R13FBNGGRVIQBH","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Osprey Fortress boulmes are justly famed for their all around excellence.  ""Norman Stone Castles 2"" is outstanding in this grand company.  This is not simply a book of pretty pictures, although the drawings by artist Adam Hook are wonderful, colorful and exquisitely detailed.  Besides Mr. Hook's drawings we have the gift of many photos of castles as they exist today, ruins in other words.  In a recent to the Osprey books innovation, many of the photos are in full color.  That adds a lot to the reader's enjoyment and understanding.  Author Christopher Gravett ends the book with thumbnail descriptions of literately dozens of castles in Normandy, Sicily and Southern Italy.  In each brief entry he gives the location and current status of that particular castle.  Mr. Gravett knows his castles.  For a time in his career he served as the senior curator at the Tower of London.  Gravett covers the subject in great detail, much more detail than we have any reason to expect in a 64 page book.  He covers things that we might expect such as life in a castle and a castle at war.  Not expected are details like the cost of castles to the people who built them.  This book is well worth the small cost for any of us with an interest in the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7P1XNN30MD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841766038#wasThisHelpful","R3S7P1XNN30MD2","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Eric Flint has the knack of creating such strong, vivid characters that we want to travel along with them as if they were our friends and not just made up people.  I got hooked with the first book in this series and eagerly wait for each new volume.  So, great characters, likable characters (who wants to read about characters who are believable but not likable?)  and what else?  Flint has a strong grasp of economics, which I enjoy.  He understands the relationship among the various aspects of technology, industry and invention that allows an economy to thrive.  So, the author is smart.  And the plot keeps us turning the pages.  He bumps off his characters once in a while so we never know quite how a particular event will unfold.  We hope the brash young teens will find some clever way to survive, but we have no surety that they will.  We want the brave, ambitious King of Sweden to survive his injuries, but we can't be sure he will.  We absolutely want the Prince of Germany to keep the balls in the air long enough to create a better world than the one he left.  The deep scholarship of the author also impresses his readers.  There are swirls and eddies in European history that Flint exposes and explores over and over again.  In reading The Saxon Uprising for enjoyment I find new knowledge on subjects of geography, language and history that enlighten me.  I put The Saxon Uprising right at the top rank of the books in this series.  I have re-read it a couple of time just to spend more time in that fascinating world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OLVGRM5DGQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451638213#wasThisHelpful","R39OLVGRM5DGQP","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Men-at rms series of books by Osprey lean heavily to the needs of model makers and this volume is no exception.  There are long tracts covering the various uniforms, helmets and what not.  The excellent full color drawings by artist Stephen Andrew go all the way back to 1911.  These drawings also show in detail many of the extravagant variety of weapons used in China in the first half of the 20th century. Oddly enough, these drawings provided more or at least as much that is of interest to me as the text.  Author Philip Jowett includes a long and detailed chronology of the battles in China between 1911 and 1949 when the Chinese civil war ended.  This helped me to understand the flow of the fighting.  Jowett has also penned several full length books on China.  I'll be looking into them for more of the details on Chinese armies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16FEX37Y00TRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1855326655#wasThisHelpful","R16FEX37Y00TRT","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bridge of Spies Ok, Seven Spielberg directs Tom Hanks for the fourth time.  We expect something extraordinary and we get something magnificent.  In every respect this film satisfies.  Hanks just keeps on getting better and better as he gets older.  The meticulous attention to detail lavished on the film by director Spielberg has not been equaled in recent memory.  The script by Ethan and Joel Coen has a solid feel illuminated at frequent intervals by brilliance.  I liked this one a lot. Some of us will remember the events in the film as part of our personal life memorabilia.  For the other, younger viewers, this film has a genuine basis in fact.  At the end of the Eisenhower administration the U2 (yes, that is where the band got its name) spy plane had just been put in operation.  Unlucky Francis Gary Powers had the misfortune of being shot down on a photo mission 70,000 feet above the Soviet Union.  Living through the experience, he suffered captivity by the Godless Communists that then ran that sorrowful nation. At more or less the same time our FBI captured a Soviet agent, a KGB officer living quietly in New York City and running an operation there.  Naturally, we wanted our pilot back safe and sound.  The communists wanted their agent back.  It seems like Kismet, no?  A simple swap, everybody gets something and we can get on with our business. Nope, nothing is as simple as it seems.  While the negotiations go on the communist government of East Germany builds the Berlin Wall and ruthlessly shoots citizens trying to escape bondage and breathe the free air of the West. Tom Hanks plays James Donovan, an insurance attorney of all things, who gets conscripted to make the arrangements.  The Soviets do not want to publicly acknowledge their agent so there can be no government to government talks.  To complicate matters further, a young American student gets snatched by the East German communists and held as a lever to force the American government into recognizing their government. This seems like a complicated, not to say tangled, story and of course it is.  But the script by the Coen brothers helps us keep up.  Also appearing is Alan Alda as the lawyers boss.  In a tiny role as an FBI agent Domenick Lombardozi (The Wire) underplays his usual bombastic self.  Amy Ryan had a very small role as Mrs. Donovan, the worried wife of the negotiator which she accomplished with grace and subtlety. This outstanding film runs for two hours and 21 minutes and will surely get a flock of Oscar nominations.  It has a mild PG-13 rating.  The budget of $40 million has returned $45 million in its first week at the box office. Watch all the way for a truly wonderful few moments of film making. Spielberg has his actors work without words for the last moments of the film.  How can an actor invoke tears while not saying a word? In real life the insurance man was not such a wild card as a negotiator.  He served in the OSS as general counsel in WWII and also as a prosecutor at the Nuremburg war crimes trials. Movie fun-watch for the Berlin theater marquee.  The theater is showing  Eins, Zwei, Dre, the German name of the American film of the time One, Two, Three, a film involving people caught up in East Berlin, West Berlin problems.  Spielberg is the man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TDRPLHWRDSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HM3E8K#wasThisHelpful","R35TDRPLHWRDSP","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Slumdog MillionaireSlumdog Millionaire is not what I expected it to be and is like nothing I have ever seen before.  I expected to see brilliant tropical colors and I expected to hear exotic music in the sound track.  I got both.  I was not expecting to see the protagonist-played by handsome young Dev Patel-having the truth beat out of him by angry Indian policemen.  The torture of the young contestant on a TV game show provides the frame for the tale of the life of the young man, the Slumdog of the title. What results is a journey into the horrid underside of Indian society.  We find out about Indian gang lords and the most horrific exploitation of children.  These children are quite literally thrown onto the garbage heap of Mumbai.  Keep in mind that horror compounds horror to the beat of peppy Hindi pop music, everything filmed in the beautiful visual feast that makes up the Indian color palette. Director Danny Boyle has made his reputation with this amazing film.  He will now be joined in conversation with the very best directors in the century of film making.  Bravo.  Co-star Freida Pinto preformed her action assignments-she was tasked to be beautiful and be in danger-with room to spare.  Patel played his role with steady stoicism, as fit the character. Slumdog Millionaire is rated R-in Indian film there is no nudity or foul language, the deserved rating is for violence and theme.  It has plucked a bouquet of 10 academy award nominations from the Academy of Motion Pictures.  This gripping, horrifying, engaging and brilliant film gets a stellar four and a half saw blades. In spite of the horrid events depicted in the film, I went away from the experience feeling quite happy and uplifted.  This is a remarkable movie, go see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KD220ES9FX4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00280GDFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KD220ES9FX4M","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Snow White and the Huntsman We all know the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.  Believe me, this is not your fathers Snow White and the sweet, goofy dwarves are nowhere in sight.  This is a fast paced action flick based closely on the traditional tale, but with a lot of extra plot stuffed in.  And it works, thanks to goodness; it already seems like forever since the Avengers started off the summer season.  Some of the other recent big budget films just didnt work well enough to justify their gy-normous production costs. Two young people that the movie audiences already appreciate star as Snow White and the Huntsman-Kristen Stewart from the Twilight series who comes to this film with hordes of fans and Chris Helmsworth recently as the Norse god Thor, a young man who has a good career ahead of him as the new hunk of Hollywood.  Helmsworth plays a troubled, even suicidal, widower who is tasked with retrieving Snow White from the deep dark woods.  He grows his character believably, he fights athletically and has the right touch of humor fed to him by the excellent writing team.  Stewart however seems to have the ability to show confused concern but little else.  Often the ingnue is not given the heavy lifting acting wise to do in a film, which works to her advantage.  She does photograph well and director Rupert Sanders does a credible job of filming around her. The big acting credits go to the enormously talented and lovely Charlize Theron as the deeply, darkly evil queen.  She scared the daylights out of me.  This is a combination of her fine talent but she was also backed up by fabulous special effects.  The combination allows us to see a being-she is hardly human when we meet her after living 20 normal lives-both irresistibly beautiful and horribly, sickeningly evil.  And there are the dwarves.  Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone lead a band of full sized English actors as the dwarves.  Movie magic makes them just as convincing as real little people and the quality of the acting is much improved. Director Rupert Sanders is known for his videos and commercials.  This is his first time as a full length movie director.  That may explain why each frame is so packed with information.  He is used to grabbing the attention of the viewer and not letting it go.  This is not just a function of speed but also of putting so much into each scene that the viewer is fully engaged in just assimilating everything on offer.  He was expertly aided by Production Designer Dominic Watkins (The Bourne Supremacy) who builds a fully realized world for his actors to inhabit.  Big snaps also go out to three times Oscar winner Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland) for Costume Design. This four saw blade winner runs seven minutes over two hours.  The PG-13 (violence, blackest of black magic) film was made with what seems to be a modest budget of $170 million.  The world-wide gross is already $96 million after only three days.  When the producers make movie goers happy, the movie goers make the producers financially happy.  Every time it happens I am reminded just how much I love the movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CU7TFVJATC0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHSG#wasThisHelpful","R1CU7TFVJATC0M","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Social Network (2010)  2010 was a kind of desert that we have to cross to find the occasional oasis of great or even above average films.  The Social Network comes along and shows us what not just a very well made film looks like but what a film of historical importance looks like.  The Social Network gives us a peek into the fast moving world of high technology and high finance.  The mostly true film tells the story of college student Mark Zuckerberg over a period of about one year when he invents and develops a new idea for application to the worldwide computer network.  Zuckerberg went from unknown college kid to mulit-millionaire in that time.  He is now 26 years old (in 2010) and worth about seven billion dollars.  He is also stupefying intelligent.  The movie shows what can happen when outright genius meets with the proper opportunity.  It is marvelous. There is so much that is good about this movie that it is hard to pick out the best people to laud.  First place should go to writer Aaron Sorkin for the script.  The development of the character of Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg-more about him later) is very carefully controlled and deliciously spooned out.  We get a feel for the young genius in the first scene where he is in conversation with his then girlfriend.  It is as good a dialog as anything I have ever seen.  Great screen writing. And the great writing is spoken, with bewildering rapidity, by actor Jesse Eisenberg (most notably from Zombieland, The Social Network was his fourth screen appearance in 2010.)  Eisenberg plays the young genius as a fast thinking, socially inept striver who knows absolutely that he has his finger on the main chance. Justin Timberlake, of whom I have no clear opinion or even knowledge, delivers a smashingly good performance as the dude who invented Napster.  He falls in with Zuckerberg and shows the young up and comer the ins and outs of the venture capital world in California.  His personal flaws quickly force him from active participation in the new company, but not until he slices off a little, very profitable chunk for himself. There is a reason why things like Face Book are invented here rather than say, France.  In America we reward people who have successful ideas, genius ideas, and can build them into something that people will want to use.  This film shows just how quickly things can happen when the time is right.  It is very instructional.  Do French geniuses go into philosophy or do they move here to make their fortune? This mostly true drama has already brought in a satisfying $85 million on a $50 million budget.  It is rated PG-13 (some pretty raw simulated bathroom sex, some drug use) but I rate it as deserving a very high 4.5 saw blades.  This is a very good movie, a timely movie and an instructional movie.  You should enjoy it as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RS9F4EFW0PNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034G4P7G#wasThisHelpful","R1RS9F4EFW0PNT","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Source Code Finally we have a movie where everything comes together to make an outstanding flick.  In Source Code the move guys deliver a complex, taut, compelling script combined with the best acting from Jake Gyllenhaal that we have seen, perhaps ever, and deft, unobtrusive directing from Ducan Jones in his first big league at bat.  Even the musical score by veteran song master Chris Brown adds to the overall success of the film.  Vera Farmiga plays the love interest so well, in such a warm lovely way that we have no trouble at all falling, along with Gyllenhall, in love with her-in eight minutes. Gyllenhaal comes to his senses on a train outside of Chicago, seated across from an attractive woman who he does not recognize.  His last memory is of piloting a helicopter in combat in Afghanistan.  He stumbles around in confusion for eight minutes, the train blows up and then finds himself in a sort of environmental capsule talking to a computer screen.  The screen person explains that he is on a mission to thwart a bomb plot.  He is sent repeatedly back into the situation on the train in eight minute slices of time, each time putting a few clues together to help him find the despicable bomber.  And each time becoming more fascinated with the lovely, warm and irresistible young woman. He also begins to put clues together about his own situation.  How did he get from Afghanistan to the environmental capsule?  What is going on with the eight minute long splices of time?  How can he enter and leave time at will?  Will he be able to prevent a dirty bomb from killing millions of people in Chicago? Source Code is billed as a Si-Fy thriller and it surely pays off on this level.  It is also a lovely and entertaining love story and works on that level also.  The PG-13 (themes of massive death) film is short but satisfying at one hour and thirty four minutes.  I think this four saw blade film is the best movie I have seen in 2011.  I bet you will like it too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Z5YNWNJS4LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XQO90O#wasThisHelpful","R38Z5YNWNJS4LD","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Splice This is the most disturbing film I have seen since Eraserhead.  Splice is even more disturbing because it involves serious moral questions about science, society and the boundaries that allow us all to live in some reasonable semblance of harmony.  The boundaries of our social structures and the limits of science are horrifyingly breached repeatedly.  It turns out that we need the boundaries to define not just our space but who we are as sentient beings.  It is also brilliantly crafted as a suspense tale and produced to the highest standards of the Hollywood magic machine.  Like great literature, it is the more disturbing for the excellence of the effort. Low wattage actor Adrien Brody (The Pianist and more than twenty other films) will be a vaguely familiar face as might be his co-star Sarah Polley, an actress in some eighteen feature films.  The true leading actor is the ever evolving creature, a mixture of the DNA of the Pollely character and the DNA of various animals.  The two smashingly intelligent scientists grow the creature in a lab and then try to raise it in their home.  The creature turns out to be all too close to being human and all to close to being an extremely dangerous wild thing, a wild thing like no other on earth. The usual Frankenstein cravats, about science meddling where it shouldnt, hold in this case, and in spades.  There are additional taboos that are violated as well.  This is almost front page news in this brave new world that we inhabit.  Gene splicing will be here soon if it isnt already in some lab in North Korea.  Cloning is now old news.  Can gene splicing be far behind? Writer-Director Vincenzo Natali has carefully built a film that is tense and suspenseful from the beginning.  We await the certain doom of the husband and wife science geniuses but with each turn things get both more intense and ickier.  Icky as in Im not sure I wanted to see that.  His previous film was Cube, a Sci-fy psychological mystery from some years ago.  This is his first time with a big budget and he proved himself. This R rated film is not for the faint of heart, and not for youngsters at all.  There is nudity, disturbing violence and very adult subject matter.  Truly, our science has outstripped our ability as a culture to cope with the new techniques.  This film rates four saw blades and a dose of Dramamine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP2C1ZDL4XQMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EYVXSW#wasThisHelpful","RP2C1ZDL4XQMN","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Star Trek Trekkers (not Trekkies, please) all around the world are thanking their lucky galaxies this weekend.  The new movie is a wonderful thing, wonderful in the fullest and most antique sense, something that stuns and startles the viewer.  The space scenes are the most beautiful since the exploding star ships in Starship Troopers. The story takes us back to the academy days of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty and the rest of the characters from the original series which first ran 43 years ago.  The players have successfully imagined what the teen age or young 20 something cadets would be like, with the elder versions to go by.  Englands Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) is dead on as the young engineer Scotty.  Other stand out are Karl Urban as Bones, the beautiful Zoe Saldana as Uhuru and John Cho as Sulu. Also look for Winona Ryder as Spocks mom and Jennifer Morrison of TVs House briefly as Kirks mom.  Leonard Nimoy returns as Spock Prime in a time twist. Chris Pine is absolutely spot on as the uninhibited-even snotty-, aggressive and brilliant young Kirk.  The casting agent should get an Oscar. Director/Producer J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible III, the best one) has given us a nearly flawless movie with well developed characters and without slipping into cuteness or camp.  This is a big movie about heroes. Kirk is a hero.  A hero is the guy that gets beat down but gets back up.  Kirk spends a fair amount of time in the movie face down in his own blood.  But he gets back up again; he never, ever gives up. Industrial Light and Magic is back for this film.  They did the special effects for the very first Star Trek movie. This movie is rated PG-13 for space violence.  Star Trek gets an outstanding 4 and a half saw blades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXGQ3EW0TPS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WV5A9G#wasThisHelpful","R2TXGQ3EW0TPS8","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1993 it grossed a not so much $3.3 million in the domestic box office.  A film with such a solidly American appeal was never released overseas but it probably should have seen farther shores.  When we think of the horrible Zombie flicks the Europeans have sent us it would serve them right to have a sweet American teen film about Zombie love sent to them.  They might even like it.  I did. Lets start with the stuff that we like.  First of all, the film makers had the backing of a major studio.  This is a full on studio production with all that means in terms of the production values, the sound, lighting and what not, that come across poorly in low budget Zombie flicks.  No problems there.  Director Bob Balaban has accumulated more than 25 directorial gigs but we recognize him as a frequent character actor with some 102 gigs. You would recognize him at once.  So the direction is solid.  Ditto the writing.  This makes writer Dean Loreys first time at bat and he presents a credible if not exactly original script.  He borrows from hither and yon including from Heaven Can Wait.  These guys depend upon frequent dream sequences for much of the action which seems to zig and jink the flow of the story to my view.  Minor quibble this.  Lorey went on to have a strong career as a writer and producer in Hollywood.  He and Balaban-along with many cast members-are still active in show biz. Side note-writer Lorey came to earth two years after director Bob Balabans first acting role.  Balaban has been working in Tinsel Town for 50 years. The cast must make up one of if not the most impressive cast of any Zombie movie ever filmed.  Four future Oscar winners went on film for this light hearted teem romance with a Zombie as the leading man.  Director Bob Balaban has an Oscar nomination, so he must be pretty good too. A nice but unpopular kid (Andrew Lowery) has had a crush on Missy (Tracy Lind) since 1st grade.  She is only peripherally aware of his existence.  On the eve of the senior year prom, he stages a fake robbery at the connivance store where she works only to have an real robber come in and shoot him dead.  Well, he stays dead long enough for the funeral, then comes back.  This kid gets Zombied not from comets, serum, gas, or virus but from a clerical error in Heaven.  The boy is an earnest if very ordinary guy, the girl a spectacular knock out.  He did die for her, which makes him special.  He also came back from the dead.  Not many high school girls can claim a suitor with such determination.  I found it all rather sweet. But the cast make this thing work.  They take a silly sort of teen romance and play it with dead pan seriousness even when the unlikely Zombie theme enters the mix.  The boys mom and dad are played by Edward Herman, a familiar face with 131 credits and Mary Beth Hurt is hilarious as the helpful, protective mother.  Both are still working. Lowery and Lind do fine.  Lind was 25 when she played the younger school girl but both did fine and Lind was just scrumptious.  I did have to stifle my laugh reflex when she over used the ling Eat me with no innuendo offered, simple smut served with the very thin Zombie theme fig leaf. Also in the cast are Oscar winners Cloris Leachman as the wife of a previous Zombie mix up, Matthew McConaghey as Guy 2 in his first big screen role and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a lumpish teen bully.  Oscar winner Rene Zellweger was also filmed for the movie as a girl preparing for the prom in the local beauty shop but she ended up on the cutting room floor.  All these actors, save the late Mr. Hoffman, still have active careers. The occasionally helpful local doctor is played by funny man and now very experienced actor Austin Pendleton.  You will recognize him from his 133 roles.  His best line was We usually dont see this much activity in a dead person. I recommend My Boyfriends Back for the enjoyment factor and as an example of a studio effort of the era.  It carries a mild PG-13 rating with mild eating mostly hinted at, ditto for teen sexual themes.  More is hinted at then shown, no skin reveled.  There is a running gag about specific body parts rotting away which comes about as close to an outright sexual reference as we get.  It runs one hour and 25 minutes.  Three and a half brains for this star filled teen romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0UBXO39OZDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068MC1#wasThisHelpful","R3W0UBXO39OZDL","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Intern This well crafted comedy comes straight from the MGM playbook circa 1940.  Think of the great, light and light hearted Carry Grant comedies and you will get the flavor, the style and the charm of this 21st edition of that great old formula.  It still works and in this case it still works very well. Robert De Niro acts here as Ben, a retired widower of some 70 years of age.  Since his retirement and bereavement he has traveled a bit, he has taken some classes and learned to speak Chinese.  But now he feels at loose ends.  He experiences the tedium of empty days with nothing special to do. Anne Hathaway has created a little internet company in Brooklyn New York.  The young wife and mother has the dilemma of successful start up businesses, in this case a business that sends clothing that actually fits to women across the land.  The genius behind the successful business is not a business manager.  She is a passionate innovator, a brilliant motivator but she cannot cope with a business that has grown from one person, herself, to over 250 employees in a year and a half.  She drowns in her own success.  Her backers want to bring in a professional manager to enter the next stage of the life of the company.  One of he hundreds of 20 something bright lights suggests that the company employ a few interns but with a twist.  If the company brings in a few retired folks their wisdom, knowledge and experience might just help the company to greater success.  Enter Ben, the De Niro character. You pretty much can guess what happens from here on out.  Ben, the calm voice of experience, nicely balances the fire of the determined but untrained young woman.  What we like is the very sharp acting from Anne Hathaway.  This may be her best role so far strictly in terms of her acting performance and that says a lot.  She has turned in some sparkling efforts in a number of well received films.  The Intern might not have the high drama of some other of her films but the overwhelming pleasantness of the film over all and her superb performance make it memorable.  De Niro continues his career and here acts with the muted restraint of an elder who finds himself in a junior position.  Always excellent he remains so here. Also of note we receive the gift of Rene Russo, a watchable actress in a small but charming role as the company masseuse. Yes, the new company is just hip enough to have a company masseuse.  Many of the other young cast members will seem familiar from their roles in various TV comedies. Writer/director Nancy Meyers had both the inspiration to write the script and the directorial control to oversee the final output.  She has a string of modest sized films which have found their audiences to extremely profitable success.  She crafted such hits as What Women Want and Its Complicated. Rarely in a film do we have a chance to meet and like a series of characters, a list which grows as the film goes on.  Even the minor supporting cast members bring their small bits of the story into sharp focus as real people that we can know, however briefly, and to appreciate. This reminds us of the great films of yesteryear.  We like the characters very much.  We have no distractions from the story of naked people doing what they do or violence of any sort or of foul language.  Instead we get an interesting story played by actors who are allowed to act to the extent of their abilities, another rarity. The Intern gets a big three and a half saw blades.  It runs for two hours and one minute.  The PG-13 rated movie brought in a very strong $32 million over the opening weekend on a $40 million budget.  Nancy Meyers has made another movie that people will gladly watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TG3X94IN4KFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TGNFQK#wasThisHelpful","R3TG3X94IN4KFP","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"P.F. Chisholm has created some of the most vivid characters I have read in a long time.  The mystery set in the time of Queen involves some actual historical characters and some made up characters. The mix works well.  I enjoy the historical setting and the author has a firm grip on the time she writes about.Make no mistake, the wonderful characters are what make this such a joy to read.  The book goes quickly both because of the short legnth and because we want to hurry to discover the solution to the mystery.  Too bad the books aren't four times as long.  We would have more time to live in the world she creates.Fast light reading and highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRGK5AJAZ1S9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890208434#wasThisHelpful","RRGK5AJAZ1S9C","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz (2013) Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz marks the third in what we hope will turn out to be the continuing franchise of well crafted, reasonably well acted and successful Zombie flicks from the young Black Camel film production company.  The producers have now, quite thriftily, used the same underground bunker as the set for all three films.  They spent the money saved to improve the look and the feel of the film.  Good on um. In this episode we might from the title think we have some kind of a Commie Zombie vs. Nazi Zombie flick a la this theme explored in Dead Snow 2 (which see reviewed elsewhere) but no.  The action takes place in the memory of an elderly Russian, a man who uses vodka to stimulate his reminisces, a more or less typical Russian in other words.  But what he remembers is a terrifying story of fiendish Nazi SS experiments at turning ordinary men into un-dead soldiers.  The SS scientists use a combination of serum and a big electrical machine to do the nasty work.  The machine played a central role in the second Outpost movie.  The Nazis have no compassion on anyone, as we know to our sorrow from actual history.  If the Nazis didnt in real life slaughter the helpless to further their experiments in re-animating the dead it is only because they didnt think of it. Writer Rae Bruton has scribed all three Outpost films.  In number III his writing becomes more mature and more complex.  His central characters are Russian soldiers in some kind of independent commando unit who have penetrated to the Nazi bunker somewhere in what at the time was Yugoslavia.  They have no back up. A lot of the action is simple war stuff with ambushes, a crack sniper and a lot of running around in the woods.  All this stuff works well because of the careful staging, insitful dialog, carefully stage action and the spot on authenticity of the weapons and vehicles.  I am a deep history buff and using the real thing rather than, in one case, paint ball guns really makes a film better for me.  They use what looks like an actual Opel Blitz truck and a real German army half track.  The Volkswagen light vehicle and the BMW motorcycle/sidecar combination are not as rare but still show the dedication to realism by the prop department.  And perhaps the success of the earlier films that allowed a larger budget. The Zombies move quickly and have a highish order of intelligence.  They are also big dudes and the make-up makes them look like the monstrosities they are.  One of the SS officers uses a Zombie in the same manner as others would use a Rottweiler.  The Z is kept on a chain until someone needs to be ripped apart.  Chilling that. Kieran Parker directed with intelligence and competence.  This makes his first outing as a director.  We know him as the producer of all three of the Outpost films as well as the screen writer for the first film.  He is joined by Arabella Page Croft and some others in the producer duties.  Croft has been involved with the films from the first and now is associated with other, non Zombie, Black Camel projects.  The young company can now be called a success. Brian Lankin, from Scotland, and Hungarian born Ivan Kamaras play the leading Russian soldiers.  Lankin has over 30 credits.  Kamaras enjoys a successful career with over 60 credits, including some famous Hollywood films but mostly in Hungarian TV.  We have been pleased with the acting from the original Outpost but these guys bump it up a notch.  In one of my favorite lines one Russian notes of a young soldier God made you a poet but Stalin made you a soldier. Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz gets a solid three brains.  The unrated film should carry an R rating for some of the most violent Zombie attacks ever and very realistic flesh rending.  They filmed it in 28 days and made Yorkshire and Glasgow look enough like to Balkans to fool me.  The run time comes to one hour and 24 minutes. My only quibble is that sometimes the gunfire effects to not match up to the actors actions.  I know, picky.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKNY1I1WBDI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB0OR9S#wasThisHelpful","R2DKNY1I1WBDI5","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ted In all story-telling the audience must engage in what we call a willing suspension of disbelief.  In this case we must somehow believe that the hard working, ambitious and truly lovely Lori (Mila Kunis) has remained for four years in a relationship with John (Mark Wahlberg), a slacker/stoner in his mid 30s who would rather hang out with his best friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) than give his attention to his girlfriend.  IRL (in real life) this relationship would not last from Friday until Monday.  Oh, and the best friend is a Teddy Bear magically brought to life, somewhat more believable than the stoner/striver romance. But this R rated comedy is funny.  Fans of TVs The Family Guy will be in familiar territory here.  Wahlberg plays a big hearted, dim witted loser, just like Peter Griffith in the TV show.  Mila Kunis is the much smarter love interest who somehow can tolerate her slower partner, just like Lois Griffith in the TV show.  Even the talking Teddy Bear has a TV counterpart in Brian the Griffith familys talking dog. This $50 million live action cartoon is all MacFarlane.  He produced the movie, he wrote the movie and he directed the movie.  He even does the voice of Ted, the talking Teddy Bear.  Fans of Seth MacFarlane and The Family Guy will enjoy the humor and familiar set ups in the movie.  This is R rated for language and adult situations, as fans will expect.  Oddly, the only nudity is in a non-sexual scene where the stoner and the best friend explain why Garfield the cartoon cat has eyes that resemble the female breast.  But there is enough other stuff to justify the R rating.  Giovanni Ribisi has an important role as a crazy kidnapper who wants Ted for his own son.  He somehow does not make the connection between the living bear (who points out to the nut job that he is an American citizen, not a toy) and his intrinsic humanity, a theme developed in better movies such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and I Robot.  Ribisi, seen lately in The Rum Diaries and long ago as the medic in Saving Private Ryan, is an old pro with more than 80 movie and TV roles to his credit.  His crazy is both creepy enough and quirky enough to give him the honors for best actor in this movie.  Jessica Barth plays Tami-Lynn, the Teddy Bears trailer trash girlfriend (echoing Family Guy again, Brian the talking dog has a girlfriend with a similar lower class background).  The spectacularly beautiful Barth is a new pro with several minor roles to her credit.  She also has several voice roles on Family Guy, so she and Seth MacFarlane have worked together in the past. There is a sub plot that revolves around the 1980 camp favorite, Flash Gordon.  Star Sam J. Jones appears as himself in Ted where the Wahlberg, the stoner fan, and his ursine pal invite him to a house party.  There is some very nice writing and acting when the fans get whacked on cocaine with their screen hero. This one hour and 46 minute adult comedy has plenty of laugh lines, clever writing and good acting.  If much of it is familiar, well fans of Family Guy will like it and people who liked the Hangover movies will also this three saw blade comedy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVP0V08ZR14M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAII12#wasThisHelpful","R3MVP0V08ZR14M","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Otto or Up With Dead People This German import with its Canadian writer/director exhibits all the absurdities of post modern, pretentious, over intellectualized European artistic culture mixed with frankly disgusting soft core gay porn.  To some this will masquerade as cutting edge, avante guarde film making but there is really nothing here about contemporary culture that the opening three minutes of the original Mad Max didn't cover adequately.  As a film to watch and enjoy we in the seats get nothing. But as an exercise in film making we get quite a lot.  Writer/Director Bruce La Bruce mixes up a lot of film techniques in an imaginative way.  La Bruce has filmed such fare as LA Zombies and No Skin off my Ass.  He is known for working themes of social alienation into gay porn films.  The only thing that really worked for me in Otto or Up With Dead People is his send up of bored, brilliant and arrogant European film makers. Katharina Klewinghaus plays Medea Yarn, an independent film maker in Germany making a 'revolutionary' film called Up with Dead People  about gay Zombies and how they want to over throw the established order to defeat the oppressive, stultifying hand of the living.  Her film has all the usual ill thought through leftist clap trap about over fed Westerners in a world filled with starving third world hordes.  Klewinghaus nails the role.  Much of the film within a film consists of her narrating with ennui laced intellectual distance her tale of the revolutionary Zombies.  One cannot help but think of the Bader-Meinhof gang who mouthed the same sort of stuff 40 years ago.  The radical gangsters used their ideology to excuse murder.  Medea Yarn merely bores us.  Ok, nobody much has any use for self righteous intellectuals, we get that. But Otto, an actual Zombie gets hired on to play a Zombie in Medea Yarn's gay Zombie revolutionary film.  He has some higher level brain function and when alive had a gay lover.  The film within a film by Medea we receive in black and white, the real life stuff with Otto we get in color.  Director La Bruce switches back and forth with little connective narrative and even puts in some filler from a previous Medea Yarn film that adds nothing to our understanding or enjoyment as audience members. Belgium born Jey Crisfar plays Otto with dead pan seriousness.  His only other credit is The Advocate for Fagdom.  I found Klewinghaus believable and perhaps the best actor in the film.  Her other credit is another Bruce La Bruce film called The Bad Breast. This ill conceived, tedious, unnecessary film is watchable only for the peek at various film making techniques.  The scene of a gay orgy mixed with Zombie style cannibalism triggered my gorge reflex like no film I have seen since Eraser Head. One brain, not recommended.  94 minutes long but seems much longer.  Not rated but would carry a hard R ratting for sexual content, violence and Zombie flesh eating.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C524MUUM4OS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L1CNFC#wasThisHelpful","R3C524MUUM4OS1","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louis LAmours Crossfire Trail (2001) Tom Selleck had a mini-career with made for TV westerns.  Named Louis LAmours Crossfire Trail for some reason that escapes me, this one ranks up at the top of these quickly made films.  I am not alone in liking Crossfire Trail.  Writer Charles Robert Carner won the Bronze Wrangler award for his teleplay for the TV movie.  Carner is perhaps better known for writing the script for Witless Protection, Blind Fury and the iconic Vanishing Point. The director also has a long history of film making to his credit.  Australian born veteran film maker Simon Wincer put together a solid, traditional Western which we enjoyed watching, never mind the flaws.  Of his many movies fans will remember most fondly The Light Horseman and Quigley Down Under.  Quigley also starred Tom Selleck. Wincer assembled a very strong cast which for me makes the film.  Virginia Masen plays the female lead.  The beautiful actress has made dozens of films including Sideways, one of my favorite films.  A woman with strong abilities on screen, she convincingly portrays the frightened widow, alone in a dangerous land. In the story, Selleck and two friends, Shanghaied on a ship out of San Francisco, are befriended by a man who is murdered by the ships captain.  The trio vow to take care of the dead mans ranch and wife in Wyoming.  Skullduggery, double dealing and murder abound in a classic Western tale of honor and revenge. Also featured are Wilford Brimley, Christian Kane (now appearing in TVs The Librarian), Berry Corbin, Rex Linn, William Sanderson (Blade Runner), and Mark Harmon as the smooth talking sociopath who runs the little western town.  Even in a made for TV movie it helps to have good actors in their places. Cinematographer David Egghy (Pitch Black, Mad Max) takes full advantage of the landscape around Calgary, Alberta to produce some of the beautiful film scapes that we relish in a good Western.  Gorgeous. They may have pushed the film making too quickly or maybe stuffing the story into a 95 minute long frame caused the avoidable flaws but they are still there.  When the heroes leave a woman with a broken leg in the middle of fixing her up or when the new guy in town stalks out of the bar without paying, we notice, it jars our sense of the flow of things. Still, the classic western deserves a solid, if not spectacular, three saw blades and remains a good entertainment value.  This was the highest watched made for TV movie at its debut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUKXOCEUU0QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JXI9#wasThisHelpful","R1WUKXOCEUU0QF","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rodeo 101 by Jinx Pyle and Jayne Peace. History buffs and Payson rodeo aficionados alike will enjoy this record of the first century and a year of the Worlds Oldest Continuous Rodeo.  Jinx Pyle and Jayne Peace have meticulous pieced together the definitive chronicle of the rodeo that began on the dirt Main Street of Payson in 1884, complete with hundreds of period photos.  We meet people like Arizona Charlie Meadows and John Collins Chilson, the organizers of the first established rodeo in Payson.  Arizona Charlie went on to a larger stage, traveling the world with a Wild West show.  We meet dozens of cow hands who competed with each other, finding who was best at the daily tasks of ranch life.  On at least two occasions the rodeo nearly faltered only to be rescued by the generous and open hands of local ranchers who ponied up cash money to keep the show going. As times changed and roads became more easily passable, the rodeo grew more famous and professional circuit riding cowboys gradually edged out the local cow hands.  The rodeo became more popular as a tourist draw and there were years when the attendance at the rodeo exceeded the population of the little town.  Early or late, the population influx caused problems for the local law men who at one point simply hand cuffed bad actors to poles and left them to sober up. Jinx and Jane Peace try succeed in recording the names of the contestants, local hands and famous world champions alike.  We have a section on the rodeo queens in the years that we had our own queens here in Payson.  We meet locally famous ranchers and the horses that generated excitement and lavish bets in the years that horse racing had a big place in what they called in those days the August Doins. We are treated to many stories handed down through the memories of local families, stories sometimes funny, sometimes simply rustic but always with the authentic voice of the time and place.  My personal favorite is a tale told by Roger Buchanan.  Before the highway out of town got its pavement the local ranch people came to town for socialization only at seldom junctures.  When they came to the rodeo it was a big deal, seeing friends, shopping and having a big time with the gambling, the dancing, the racing and of course watching the athletes compete.  Nobody had much money.  Ronnie McDaniel gave me 50 cents so I could ride the ponies at the carnival in 1952.  It was the first time I had ever seen him!  Ronnie was a big kid about 12.  I was eight.  Payson was that way.  The big kids looked after the little kids. Later in life Ronnie McDaniel rode bulls in the Payson rodeo.  Today, to my vast satisfaction, he leads my own little town of Star Valley as the Mayor.  Rodeo 101  has a ton of little stories like this, stories of regular people living their lives and coming to the big show once a year.  Read it and you will come to know our community in a different, deeper and more meaningful way.  Its fun too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305XJYSYEZ1WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ60FE#wasThisHelpful","R305XJYSYEZ1WY","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For Us the Living by Robert A. Heinlein Written in 1938 but not published until after the turn of the new century, this peek into the mind of Robert Heinlein will fascinate students of his ideas and of his writing.  The writing frankly holds little fascination.  Most of the book is a series of dialog set ups, conversations between a time traveler and several future people who try to explain the set up in the late 21st century.  Perry Nelson (and Heinlein) in July of 1939 knew nothing of the history of the next 150 years.  But Heinlein does have a boodle of ideas about future to him gizmos, techniques and gadgets, many of which have nowadays analogs.  I am working my way through his back list by re-reading the books I first read 50 years ago but this is my first look at For Us the Living.  The analogs he supposes to modern things like Amazon and FedEx are amazing, along with many others.  In this respect the book has an important place in futuristic literature. But the sub-title is A Comedy of Customs which gives the author the scope to examine (and eviscerate) deeply held social ideas.  Heinlein has a recurring ken for romantic and sexual customs, customs which he postulates are much more flexible than most of us believe.  In this, his earliest novel, he has his characters happily and healthily settle into a three person relationship.  In his personal life he explored such practices but to no great revelation such practices did not end well for him.  But that was later in his life.  Still, in his later writing he continues the exploration of ideas that real life had shown to be in error. He also supposes an economic system that at first blush seems decidedly odd and absurdly unworkable.  But in the contemporary world, the government does indeed simply create money out of strokes on a computer key board.  This is not far off from how Heinleins invented world operates.  It does not seem like a viable model to me but who the heck knows?  Maybe money does come from manipulating bits and bytes and I am all wet. In any case, Heinlein fans will want to read this if just to see what the Master had up his sleeve in 1938 when he wrote it.  It isnt an astonishing triumph of the writers craft but it is interesting as a prediction of future tech and an early look at how Heinlein looked at male-female relations.  He might not in the end be right about our flexibility but he has a well thought out take on sex that he holds onto throughout his works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGZVJD63J4E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743491548#wasThisHelpful","R2BGZVJD63J4E0","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Movie Review by Andy McKinneyMission Impossible: Rogue Nation We get a lift in our heart beat just hearing the familiar bars of the Mission Impossible theme song as the new Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation begins.  And because Simon Pegg has a prominent place in the opening scene, we get a couple of smiles as well.  We start off with a roar, well a roar and a crazy stunt where hugely rich movie star Tom Cruise actually hangs from the closed door of an Airbus A400 at an actual 5,000 feet above the earth.  In a franchise noted for remarkable physical stunts this surely ranks among the most dangerous. Cruse and Pegg also do their own high speed stunt driving in the film, which also falls outside of the usual movie making structure where expert (and more easily replaced) drivers typically do the dangerous stuff. But does this exciting fol de rol make a good movie?  Well, pretty much.  The writer/director Christopher McQuarrie let a couple of false notes into the play but by the time we realize it, we are gone again, swept up into some new extravaganza of action. Cruise always surprises me when he pulls off a solid action hero role in a totally believable way.  Deep down I still think of him as the teen heart throb from Risky Business but he beats and bludgeons his way through the fight scenes as well as anyone working today. He is backed up by Ving Rhames, who along with only Cruise himself has made all five MI movies.  Alec Baldwin as the CIA chief has the role of duplicitous, self absorbed government functionary down pat.  Jeremy Renner, another action hero actor, has a calmer role as the head of MI.  Englishman Sean Harris plays the head of The Syndicate, the super villains outfit with an eerie menace.  To see another great role for Harris, watch the TV series The Borgias where he plays one of the most interesting and terrifying assassins on film in several episodes. Writer/Director McQuarrie wrote the fabulous The Usual Suspects and wrote the Cruise films Jack Reacher, Valkyrie and Edge of Tomorrow which makes the false note in this film the more glaring.  Sadly, both boo boos revolve around Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson.  In one of the coolest sequences in the movie, her character leads a chase sequence on motorcycles through the hills of Morocco that had no believable reason for happening (great sequence for sure and very exciting).  And she makes a personal overture to Cruise that had no buildup to make it work.  Fergusons has a face fresh to us and she acts in a convincing way, the fault rests with the writer. The stupendous $150 million budget spawned a hefty worldwide gross of $121 million so he producers should be happy.  The film carries a mild PG-13 rating so we have no issues with language or sexual themes, only violence.  This solid three saw blade film has the best sort of high speed visual fun for us to enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L54E9RFPP8L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XYP82U#wasThisHelpful","R1L54E9RFPP8L5","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terminator Salvation What can be said for a film culture which insists upon the certainty of a sequel to the adventure of a new idea?  Of the six top scoring movies this weekend, five are sequels.  That said, boy is Terminator Salvation a good sequel. Some have criticized the convoluted story line, with time sequences garbled beyond understanding.  Some have criticized the lack of characters one can bond with, save of course Christian Bale as John Connor.  I say pish, if we wanted an understandable story, we wouldnt have put in so many explosions, and more explosions, and ever bigger explosions.  This is a genuine explosion fest. Bale is certainly one of the most intense actors working today.  He is the only big star in the film, if you dont count the special effects guys.  He is just enough and has just enough to do to make this a cut above the Fast and Furious films. He is supported by Sam Worthington in a fine role as a re-built human.  The wonderfully named Moon Bloodgood shows how to play it both tough and tender.  Both of them are now marked on directors want lists. Director McG proves that he can handle a $200 million action flick with the best of them.  He directed both Charlies Angles films and We Are Marshall.  His street credibility has increased. Terminator Salvation came in second to Night at the Museum but still clipped $43 million from the $224 total box office over the weekend.  This film pushed the Terminator franchise to number four and insures that there will be a number five. The PG-13 (movie violence, mostly done to machines) movie rates a respectable three and a half saw blades.  Fans will like it.  Be sure to watch for a brief cameo by Arnold himself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFLPAIJUK2FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FB55HQ#wasThisHelpful","RMFLPAIJUK2FM","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vengeance (2009) Hong Kong director Johnnie To has made more than 30 films but this is my first of his films.  The exuberance and craft of this action flick struck me.  The imagination thrown into this film by director To and writer Ka-Fai Wai delights and astonishes the Western viewer.  As director or writer this pair of seasoned pros have between them built about 70 movies.  Their experience shows. Two French actors were hired by the Hong Kong film makers.  Actor and rock and roll star Johnny Hallyday plays Costello, a French chef.  Sylvie Testud has the role of the chef's daughter.  The daughter, her children and her husband are slaughtered by Chinese gangsters.  The chef-father swears revenge.  What follows is a more or less conventional shoot'um up with scenes in Hong Kong and Macau.  The father hires three gangsters to help him find and dispatch his daughter's murders. The durable gangsters can take a lot of punishment.  When people get shot puffs of fine red mist appear, which if not all that realistic certainly is colorful.  We have the treat of long, involved shoot outs with lots of bullets flying around. All in all, I liked this somewhat fantastic crime-thriller a lot.  Do not think of the Godfather but more of a fast fun ride with lots of interesting visual effects.  The makers throw in an unusual plot twist about the chef which I liked and some innovative battle scenes as well as a bit of off the wall mysticism. Not rated but would get an R for violence and a couple of people shot to shreds while having vigorous sex. I need to watch more Hong Kong movies if just for the wow factor of seeing very imaginative films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5LNJH90OMJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9W62JK#wasThisHelpful","RU5LNJH90OMJP","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Game of Kings by Dorthy Dunnett The Game of Kings kicks Dorthy Dunnett's six volume series, the Lymond Chronicles, into furious gear.  Dunnett has created one of the enduring literary characters in her hero, Lymond of Crawford, the Master of Cutler.  The Master, as his sixteenth century Scotts contemporaries call him, has the durability of Vin Diesel, the heroism of James Bond, the erudition of James Joyce, the graceful athleticism of Buckham and the looks of a teen heart throb.  Does that seem like a lot to stuff into a single character?  Dunnett makes it work.  It works so well that the Lymond books have become and remain one of the most compelling and popular series in all of historical fiction. Lymond has the fortune of being the second son of a middling family of the Scotts nobility.  Queen Mary is a four year old, the nation has enemies within and without.  The English have no reluctance about re-uniting the two kingdoms by physical annexation, provided England can muster the powder and power to do the job.  The ever fractious nobility of Scotland turns itself inside out in seeking for familial advantage, often at the disadvantage of the nation as a whole. Lymond, an outlaw with every man's hand against him, including the two strong hands of his elder brother, tries to stay alive, to help his country and to clear his name, fouled by the most heinous offalse charges. Dunnett writes a plot complicated enough for any mystery fan, populated with characters vividly drawn down into the third and forth tier of importance.  A glove maker who occupies only a few pages has the depth and living breath of a genuine person just as much as one of the major characters who live on scores of pages.  Plot has a great importance to the reader but plot cannot interest us in characters who we cannot understand or believe.  Dunnett does both well enough to make her a lasting personage in literature. And she does it with a staggering density of writing.  Nearly every sentence carries a heavy freight of historical, cultural, linguistic and mythological allusion.  We are not simply entertained, we are instructed.  And we are enthralled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21T9EQ9N1CSVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679777431#wasThisHelpful","R21T9EQ9N1CSVL","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Movie Review by Andy McKinneySouthpaw People who enjoy the tension and violence of boxing films will surely like Southpaw.  People who enjoy magnificent acting will enjoy Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal of the boxer Billy Hope.  This role follows hard on the heels of his astonishing performance in last years Nightcrawler and we now have Gyllenhaal at the top of the pile of living screen artists... if not at the top of movie stars in terms of box office draw.  In Nightcrawler Gyllenhall played so well a character so odious that people rushed to the water closet after the film to get a good strong wash up.  His Bill Hope has all the qualities we expect in a pro fighter.  He can stand pain, he can take and give punishment, his drive and determination have no equal-he can fight and win.  But he has been stunted in his emotions to the point that he can hardly express himself to those he clearly loves deeply.  He has no educational attainment that we notice nor does he come up even to average in intelligence.  He cannot control his own anger.  He seems to think that his life operates as a series of discreet, random events.  None of these failings make him a person that we like.  Gyllenhaal perfectly produces for us a man doomed by his own failings rather than a man whose courage overcomes those failings.  Billy Hope is not Rocky.  We liked Rocky Balboa but we never quite like Billy Hope.  But the movie Southpaw punches far above its weight to become a much much better film. We start when Billy has the world by the tail.  His beautiful, smart, street wise wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) guides and loves him.  They live in an extravagant mansion with their daughter Leila (played by soon to be very famous child star Oona Laurence).  His agent (well played by new to acting rapper 50 Cent) finds lucrative matches for him.  In short order his wife is dead, he is bankrupt, his manager works for his chief rival and his daughter suffers in the hands of child protective services.  Total, rock bottom downfall and not due to chance or fate but to his own human limitations and terrible deficits. Naomie Harris has a small role as a child welfare worker but I could have watcher her for much longer than her few short scenes.  In a greater and much more meaty role Forest Whitaker agrees to train Billy Hope for his comeback fight.  Whitaker cannot make a less than stellar appearance and here he supplies the solidity that holds the film together. People often ask me about the decline in American film making.  This hard handed look into the life of Billy Hope is not a trivial movie experience.  Some of the best acting of the year is on display in Southpaw.  The script by first time film writer Kurt Sutter stumbles for me but not until the last few minutes of the film which I thought left us with a flat and unsatisfying ending. The direction by Antoine Fuqua however has nary a flaw.  The difficult task of filming boxing match that doesn't recede into boredom or pathos he accomplishes with seeming ease.  Fuqua directed such well received, tense, realistic, gritty films as Training Day, The Equalizer and Olympus has Fallen. The three saw blade film would have scored higher as both the acting and direction deserve save for the ending.  We deserved to leave the theater saying Wow instead of It's over?  On a budget of $30 million it took in a solid $16,500,000 over the week end over tough competition.  Southpaw runs for two hours and 3 minutes while holding a hard R rating for violence and language. On a somber note we report the sudden death of double Oscar winning composer James Horner.  Horner scored Southpaw and many other famous films including Titanic for which he took the golden gizmo for best score and best song-the now immortal My Heart Will Go On sung by Celine Dion.  He died at the controls of his own airplane on June 22, 2015.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAU7397S7DQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BPM536#wasThisHelpful","RZAU7397S7DQH","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff by Matt Kibbe Matt Kibbe of Freedom Works presents both the need for a libertarian restoration of rationality in American and a collection of reforms that will go a long ways toward that restoration.  Liberty of course will be at the crux of any reforms. The first part of the lively text contains a familiar recitation of the horrors of an over reaching government in the current administration and horrors that have been long in the making.  You know what they are.  At the heart of all of them is a government out of control even of its own advocates who sit in the offices of power in Washington D.C.  How do I know the government is out of control of even those who are putatively in control of it?  Because when ever some enormity comes to public light the agency head always has the same answer.  Gee I didn't know my subordinates were selling guns to narko-terriorists.  or Gee I didn't know my subordinates were using the IRS to go after the political opponents of the President. Mr. Kibbe does give us a list of 12 reforms that will go a long way to  helping the current desperate situation.  I regret that he does not give more concrete advise on how to accomplish his goal. His six principals however do give one hope to continue the struggle.  Don't Hurt People.  Don't take people's stuff.  Take responsibility.  Work for it. Mind your own business.  And best of all Fight the Power. Libertarians, libertarians and those who want to understand that point of view will find Matt Kibbe a gleeful and informed guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6B5YCGZ9EKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN8PA8C#wasThisHelpful","RW6B5YCGZ9EKD","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trainwreck Amy Schumer has penned the best first time script sine Diablo Cody wrote the screenplay for Juno a few years ago.  Her writing sparkles, dances and shines.  She made me laugh over and over again. Director Judd Apatow (Knocked Up) uses his talents the way I most want directors to work their magic- unobtrusively. Amy Schumer also stars in this her first Hollywood narrative film.  She has two movies on her sheet that are simply herself doing her popular stand up material. She will appear in many more films, I hope.  She has the stuff to be a major star.  He co-star is Bill Harder.  Harder we know from Saturday Night Live (a total of six SNL comics grace the film) but in this, a straight dramatic role on his part, he does just fine. A throng of other actors and celebrities also appear in greater or smaller roles.  We have two Oscar winning actresses in the film, Tilda Swinton who is the heartless and driven magazine editor the  lead character works for and Marisa Tormei who we see with Daniel Radcliff in a totally unnecessary bit in a TV movie that in itself is a short bit of cinematic artistry.  Thank you Judd Apatow.  Randall Park, a face we like seeing, gets a minute of screen time to make his mark and he does.  John Cena, the WWF champ, has a role as a dim but sincere lover of the chaotic Trainwreck that is the lead character.  Le Bron James plays himself with enough panache that I expect to see him on screen more in the future.  He surprised me. Rapper Method Man, Tim Meadows, Chris Evert and Mathew Brodrick all have cameo roles and 100 year old actor, producer Norman Loyd also has a small role.  Add this up with Amy Schumer's acting and writing and you have a winner. The tale itself is a modern romance, inverted.  Schumer is an Up Town Girl, an urban sophisticate with no intent on marriage.  In fact her training and experience force her to avoid commitment.  She avoids any contact with men save the most primitive and fleeting assignations, quickly started and then fled from in the dark of night. This R rated comedy has much toned down language and situations compared to Schumer's stand up routines, but it is still far from a Lois approved film.  The nudity encompasses only male athletes from behind. It lasts for two hours and five minutes of laughter.  The large budget for a comedy of $35 million has so far returned $33 million at the box office and should turn a profit easily. I enjoyed this three saw blade comedy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OU64XL62GTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VPI3ZG#wasThisHelpful","R5OU64XL62GTE","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Movie Review by Andy McKinneyAnt-Man This one might surprise you.  I looks like just another massive special effects driven summer film to delight and amaze the watchers in the dark.  I think it more closely resembles a heart felt drama wrapped up in a gigantic special effects driven blockbuster.  It has elements and depths that we don't often see in a film based on yet another of the seemly infinite supply of Marvel Comic characters.  Imagine the movie as an M&M with a hard, crisp crust of special effects-flying ants, battles between suit clad miniature people and the like but the shell covers a soft creamy center of of man working through his problems and trying to keep his relationship with his daughter from disappearing in his own missteps.  Explosions, ant armies, nasty bad guys and yet a strongly appealing and very human story under it all-we get something special with Ant-Man. The good parts I have to credit to screen writer Joe Cornish, an Englishman who also directs and acts when the occasion presents itself.  He did have help from three other writers on the screen play, including star Paul Rudd.  Did Rudd pen the quips for his character? Rudd stars as the convict recruited by the Sane Scientist played by Michael Douglas to battle the Mad Scientist played by the sufficiently diabolical and insane Corey Stoll (House of Cards).  Douglas gets plenty of screen time and uses it very profitably, buffing his reputation to a new luster.  Evangeline Lily plays her role as the daughter of the Sane Scientist with vigor and a muted sense of humor.  She seems to enjoy training the soon-to-be Ant-Man in martial arts and occasionally punching his lights out. We have a deep second bench of good actors with interesting things to do, something that for me makes a movie much more fun and engaging than otherwise.  Judy Greer is nuanced as Ant-Man's estranged wife, Anthony Makie enjoys himself in a few scenes as The Falcon, another Marvel character.  John Slattery plays Howard Stark (this Marvel episode pre-dates the action in the current Iron Man films).  Wood Harris, late of The Wire, plays a cop with a few lines while Saturday Night Live legend Garrett Morris has a cameo and does the creator of the Marvel Universe, Stan Lee. Director Peyton Reed is best remembered for lighter films like Bring it On and Yes Man but he bosses this complicated mix of a film without getting in the way of the writers and players. Ant-Man lasts one hour and 57 minutes and provides solid family friendly fare with a PG-13 rating.  On a budget of $130 million it garnered some $113 million at the world wide box office so far and seems headed for a good if not spectacular profit. Ant-Man comes to the viewer in either regular 2-D or the modern incarnation of 3-D.  I would recommend seeing it in 3-D for the fun of having tiny Ant-Man bouncing around above the seats in front of you. These three saw blades of summer entertainment come with a little more substance for adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLME71S88T1WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DHP3GY#wasThisHelpful","RLME71S88T1WB","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Adjustment Bureau Sci-Fi master Philip K. Dick has had nine of his works adapted for the big screen including Total Recall, Minority Report, Screamers, A Scanner Darkly, Blade Runner, Paycheck, Next and Imposter.  More films based on his stories are in the works.  The Adjustment Bureau is the latest in this distinguished company.  World famous stars are attracted to his works because of their subtle moral complexity and texture.  And of course they are rollicking good yarns. This tale can be thought of as two stories smushed together.  In one tale a classic love story unfolds involving an aspiring politician (played by Matt Damon-who keeps getting better as an actor) and a beautiful and free spirited young dancer (enchantingly drawn by Emily Blunt in a spectacular bit of acting.)  To my mind this combination of Damon and Blunt in a romantic drama must be considered as the most compelling, realistic and satisfying film love story in a long time.  There is real chemistry between this unlikely pair that cannot be dismissed.  We would have a lovely movie experience if we had only the love story to watch. But thanks to the paranoid genius of Philip K. Dick, we have another entire story to enjoy.  The lovers are thwarted by the machinations of mysterious men in hats.  Damon asks one of them if they are angels.  The man in the hat replies that We have been called that.  What begins with a strangers kiss becomes a twisted theological tale, a deep examination of one of the central disputes in Christianity.  Is there free will in a universe where the All Knowing Creator sees even the fall of a sparrow before it happens?  Or do humans, created in the spiritual image of God, have free will?  As usual, Dick has his own quirky solution to this dispute. Blade Runner transformed Dicks story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? into one of the great classic films of Science Fiction.  Some of his other films have not always translated to film with the same success.  They are all worth watching.  The Adjustment Bureau must rank near to the top of the film adaptations of his work.  Thank the stars, Damon and Blunt, for the success of this interesting, entertaining and important film. Director George Nolfi also wrote the adaptation.  It is, in the film version, his vision and he makes it work.  He will surely be financially happy that he also served as the producer.  This four saw blade movie runs only one hour and thirty nine minutes.  The film is rated PG-13. This movie should be seen for the fine acting efforts of the stars and for the theological inquiry.  You will go away thinking about very big things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1QTQ7C6DUIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WCTLNY#wasThisHelpful","R3K1QTQ7C6DUIH","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazing Spiderman 2 The Amazing Spiderman 2 lives up to its title in two important respects.  In respect number one it has some truly beautiful effects.  One of the two villains in the picture is called Electro (played by Jamie Foxx).  He shoots bolts of electricity from his hands.  It reminded me of the sort of visual display that we might get in the old days of Cinemax when the aim was to show eye pleasing film rather than a coherent story.  Electro starts out as a Casper Milktoast sort of guy who gets transformed into an electrical creature with awesome powers, megalomania and a thirst for revenge on Spiderman.  Foxx does well enough and the slashes of energy are quite nice. The other amazing aspect of the film that concerns us is the amazing amount of money-estimates range all the way to and past $250 million-spent to make the film and the minimal emotional reward the audience receives for this giant spending spree.  If anything we hate Spiderman/Peter Parker by the end of the film for his Hamlet like indecisiveness.  Spiderman is famously conflicted about his powers, his role in society and his responsibility to his loved ones.  In The Amazing Spiderman 2 he very nearly reduces himself to psychic inertia. For a giant special effects film it works.  People in Mumbai and Ankara will find the special effects enough to make even the insane budget justified.  Special effects do not make a film enjoyable for a more sophisticated audience. The cast does what they can, and that is a lot.  Paul Giamatti has a supporting role as a bombastic Russian bad guy, a street level hood.  He plays it up to and over the top.  Giamatti rarely has a chance to play a character from a comic book and he takes full advantage of his opportunity.  Foxx, with a similar chance, plays it down giving his character more realism and depth.  Felicity Jones is wasted in a tiny role with nothing to contribute.  And get this tragic error---spoiler alert----One of the most adorable actresses working today is Emma Stone.  She adorably plays Peter Parkers girlfriend.  They have ups and downs because of Spidermans inner inability to make up his mind.  All the time we root for the kids to find a way to be happy.  And then the writers kill Emma Stone!!!  What were they thinking? Dane DeHaan is creepy and nuts as the other villain, the Green Goblin which suits his character.  Poor Andrew Garfield is happy or sad or conflicted more or less at random.  His lines were written for him, not his fault.  We remember him as Eduardo Saverin from The Social Network where he did just fine as a brilliant young billionaire in training. It may be that the Spiderman franchise is just running out of steam.  Director Mark Webb did much better in making an interesting film with The Amazing Spiderman than this sequel.  And he made a really excellent film with cab fare money with the 2009 low budget winner 500 Days of Summer.  You might rent 500 Days of Summer to prove to yourself that Webb does know how to make a movie with characters that you can give a hoot about. The writing team has done better in the past.  Writers Ales Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have co-written a sting of famous films.  Their best work, Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness is absolutely first rate.  The Island, The Legend of Zorro and Mission: Impossible III are interesting or at least watchable.  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen most closely resembles The Amazing Spiderman 2.  Both films are late franchise entries with plenty of special effects and not so much of a story we can care about.  But even the Hindenburg size budget of The Amazing Spiderman 2 might well turn a profit.  The total of North American and overseas box office gross has climbed to a hearty $369 million. The Amazing Spiderman 2 has a tame PG-13 rating and runs for two hours and 22 minutes.  This is the kind of summer time film that you might consider if you live in Phoenix and you want to get out of the 115 degree heat for a while.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9G7VH2W65S0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPS7HOA#wasThisHelpful","R9G7VH2W65S0N","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American This ennui burdened film should be called Il Americano.  It is made by Europeans for Europeans, mostly in Italy in winter by director Anton Corbijn, a very successful Dutch maker of rock videos.  This film will be rated as an artistic success perhaps, in Europe, but is not likely to become a commercial success in America.  Powerful screen presence George Clooney is not allowed to unleash his talent until the final moment of the film, and by then it is too late.  Good for you George for taking an artistic chance, unless you just wanted a payday while vacationing at your beautiful home in Italy. Whats wrong with this film?  When the film begins we do not know the true name of the main player.  We do not know for whom he works. We do not know who is trying to kill him or why. We do know that he is a master craftsman at the killing trade, a heartless, remorseless death for hire kind of guy.  Right away, we are prevented from that emotional bond with the protagonist that is so important in film by his casual, brutal murder of his lover.  We presume she is murdered by the kind of just in case carefulness that allows a hit man to reach retirement age.  When the film ends, we do not know his true name or who he works for or who is trying to kill him or why. To the audience, it seems random. In between there are long shots of Italy in winter as he drives from place to place.  That is not a good use of film.  Instead of action or intrigue, we are given frequent doses of all wraps off nudity and graphic sex between the hit man and his new love interest, a beautiful Italian prostitute.  While diverting, it does very little to advance the tale.  Thats how they do it in Europe.  Boredom and sex seem to be the hallmarks of a dying civilization. Whats right with the film?  There is a relationship between the hit man and the local Italian priest that is very good, and the last minute of the film where Clooney very quietly acts his sox off.  Attractive naked women are good in a general way but dont improve the overall slow, boring slide of the film. The properly R rated film-extreme nudity, graphic sex, several fairly antiseptic killings-runs an hour and 45 minutes.  It managed to reach number one this weekend in a tough part of the year.  We can give it only two saw blades.  For a really good hit man and whore movie, rent Payback with Mel Gibson and Maria Bello.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AD4AQL8QPG7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG993Q#wasThisHelpful","R2AD4AQL8QPG7I","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Artist I think the large wad of skepticism that I had in my heart when I entered the theater to see the Artist was entirely justified.  We have been watching films with audible dialog for some 80 years now, why would we regress to a silent film?  The Artist has been nominated for ten academy awards.  Something is going on that we don't understand until we see what is on the screen.  This is a wonderful film, a film so extraordinary that it reaches the exalted status of other five saw blade, top of the heap films. What might at first seem like a stunt or an extravagance, that is producing a silent film in black and white in this day of digital magic, turns out to be not just substantive and justified but correct in every way.  Who'd a thunk it.  The story spun out in the film is of a dashing actor of the silent era who cannot cope with the changing film industry and the woman who used to love him and the one who loves him still.  A love story between a falcon with a broken wing and the great hearted woman who is his salvation.  A tried and true tale, familiar and comforting-and often enough true, as we know from the people we know or the people we are. Now imagine that we are denied half of the audio visual experience that it is our custom to absorb.  The immediate result is that we must focus our attention precisely on the screen, or we miss something important.  This alone changes the movie experience in a decided and dramatic way.  We are, willingly or not, intensely involved the the movie in a surprisingly unique way.  Bravo,, the idea of a black and white silent film has merit after-all. The acting must be of the best quality to pull this off, and it is.  Both Jean Dujardin as the silent screen move idol and Berenice Bejo as his love interest have been nominated for best actor and best actress, respectively.  I will be mush surprised if Bejo does not end up with an Oscar and it is possible that both of them will receive the award.  It takes amazing control and talent to convincingly portray a role without being able to use your own voice.  And Miss Bejo is one of those rare actors that simply light up the screen. The film is also nominated for best picture and seven other awards.  It is rated PG 13 and runs one hour and 40 minutes.  This is a must see film, so go see it.  And it is making money with a budget of only $15 million and a world wide take of $47 million, which is sure to get much larger.  I left smiling and so will you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCW920YTTTL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00782O7IY#wasThisHelpful","R1OCW920YTTTL7","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avengers At last the winter movie doldrums are over and we have the first mega blockbuster of the summer, a little early as it turns out because the summer season is not due for a few weeks yet.  This is a full-on four and a half saw blade action super stupendous success.  This is tremendous entertainment on every checkmark of interest to the movie going public.  The direction is deft and crisp, the performances inspired and the writing imaginative and intelligent.  And all this from comes from heroes invented for the pages of Marvel Comics. The producers gave movie genius Joss Whedon $220 million to make a huge, colorful, loud and above all, an interesting action-fantasy-adventure film.  Whedon has directed only one other Hollywood film, the cult favorite Serenity.  Serenity was the big screen spin off of the Sci-fi TV series Firefly, also directed by Whedon.  He is known for his well drawn characters, and director brings this talent to The Avengers. Chris Evens, Captain America, had his own movie last year, and the Whedon directed version of his character is superior to the first incarnation.  Ditto for Chris Hemsworth as Thor.  His acting cant have gotten so much better in the year between his appearance as Thor in the stand-alone movie of that name and The Avengers.  Whedon just asked more of him and got it.  To be fair, Whedon also wrote the script for The Avengers and gave both Evens and Hemsworth more interesting things to do. But Mark Ruffulo is also more interesting to watch as Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk than any previous Hulk.  Scarlett Johansson plays a muted, introspective Black Widow whose main talent turns out to be as a very subtle interrogator, often done just before acrobatically beating up assorted bad guys.  Robert Downey Jr.-Iron Man-could not improve on his earlier performances but he certainly keeps up his excellent record.  Tony Stark-Iron Man reveals a depth of character that his fans always knew was there, but his wise cracking persona never revealed.  Gwynth Paltrow reappears as Tony Starks girlfriend Pepper Potts, in two too quick near cameos. Only Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) and Samuel L. Jackson (most movies made in the last decade) put in less than grand acting.  Renner wasnt asked to do much, so he didnt.  Jackson might just be tired, he seemed to be somewhere else, counting his money perhaps, and not paying attention to his character. But the hidden gem among the actors is Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  For an actor to convincingly play a Norse God without slipping over into self parody is difficult enough.  Hiddleston pulls it off, but Loki is also nuts to top it off.  We believe in the crazy deity completely, at least for the length of the movie. Also featured are Stellan Skarsgard, the voice of Paul Beltany and a quick take of Marvel creator Stan Lee. The clever but not over clever writing is also from movie genius Joss Whedon.  He wrote the script for Toy Story as well as Serenity and several other Hollywood films.  Between the writing and the directing the small touches that make a film both memorable and fun are due to his imagination.  (The special effects are fine but support rather than dominate the movie.) The PG-13 rated film runs two hours and 22 minutes.  It has taken in an astonishing $642 million worldwide.  This is movie making at its superlative best and has a shot at becoming a billion dollar movie.  Everybody will want to see it and most likely will.  Id like to see it again right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4F3K3SHP3CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083SBJXS#wasThisHelpful","RS4F3K3SHP3CX","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Book Thief Young French Canadian actress Sophie Nelisse forces herself to our attention in the title role as an orphaned girl reared by foster parents in World War II Germany.  Nelisse carries off the complicated role with deft aplomb, taking the character from a stunned, nearly mute, terrified child to a too quickly mature survivor in the midst of the worst war in human history.  She has an engaging screen presence.  I hope to see her again and again as she finds other roles to play. Very few films have been built around the theme of the civilian German victims of Hitlers mad war.  Perhaps after nearly 70 years the time has come.  We see Germans terrified by their own government, reduced to slow malnutrition by short rations and suffering from the mass night time air raids of the American Air Corps.  I didnt find much in the film to relieve the relentless horror of the young girls situation. But Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the adoptive parents displayed the kind of stoic courage, and in the case of Rush as Papa, astonishing kindness and touching humanity.  Australian author Markus Zusak won a slew of awards for his novel as well as the gratitude of his many readers. Director Brian Percival has this project as his entry into the big world of Hollywood directing.  He has uneven success.  One scene that he did very well showed a Nazi Party staged book burning.  Percival captures the event from the view point of the townsfolk.  The movie viewers are caught up in the emotionalism of the staged event. We can understand how dictators manipulate the citizenry by playing on our hard wired instincts.  I became enlightened, chilled and sickened all at once.  On the other side of the balance, Percival has his young actress react to every turn in the plot by hugging somebody or other, repetitious to banality by the fifth hug. Michael Petroni adapted the novel to the big TV.  The movie is rated PG-13 but perhaps because of the theme, wars inescapable horror, it might have been rated a notch higher.  The film runs a lengthily two hours and 11 minutes.  I couldnt discover the films budget but its harvest at the box office is a tiny $8 million.  Do not take popularity or the lack of it as a reflection on the quality of the film.  This dark tragedy deserves its three saw blade rating.  The acting should boost the rating but the weakness in the original text and uneven direction prevent more saw blades. Even the score by world class movie composer John Williams could not, for me, relieve the blanket of melancholy in a movie narrated-literally-by the voice of Death.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EA1CRL26JBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G15MDI0#wasThisHelpful","R30EA1CRL26JBS","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Farnham's  Freehold by Robert A. Heinlein We read and reread Heinlein because he spins a good yarn, his characters get into and out of dangerous scrapes that hold our attention.  He introduces us to people we like with virtues that we appreciate and hope to emulate.  We like the adventure.  But he gives us very much more.  He spoons us measured doses of his philosophy of human worth and dignity and the ever present danger of that worth and dignity either slipping away or of being stolen from us outright. And he hates slavery.  Farnham's Freehold deals explicitly with slavery as did Citizen of the Galaxy.  Knowing of his love of liberty this comes as no surprise to his readers.  In Farnham's Freehold he also takes on ordinary retail style racism from the most harsh and obvious to the well meaning, even unconscious sort that might be less damaging in the short run but leaves the receiver with every bit as much long term damage. I like the period speech patterns too, speech used just prior to the 1964 publishing date of the work at least by well educated, well behaved people.  Heinlein has his characters actually talk to one another and tell each other of their love (or not love as the case may be).  Part of why we enjoy the characters comes from their verbal touching.  It seems like living in the speech version of an Italian family where people constantly touch one another to show their love. The unlikely time travel tale has a family blasted into the far future by a Soviet Communist atomic attack on the USA.  In 1964 we thought that this might actually happen and many people, like Hugh Farnam took what precautions they could. The interesting story of survival with little in the way of resources entertains us for a while but the future society makes us sit up and take notice. Heinlein has a certain stock of characters that he rotates through his novels.  We accept the rotation of familiar types only because he makes them different enough to be interesting each and every time.  And he gives us new or reinforced ideas each and every time. Like Heinlein and Patrick Henry I also value Liberty. I am making a strong effort to reread the Heinlein library.  He wrote important books that still speak to us in a compelling and relevant way.  Farnham's Freehold certainly fits this mold. Read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BUC9FAC1DJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671722069#wasThisHelpful","R20BUC9FAC1DJI","A3HL4CWBBPL1WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HL4CWBBPL1WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here are a few things that you need to know before reading a Sara Shepard book:1. The guilty party will never be the first person the girls (because the main characters are always teenage girls) suspect. The girls will suspect someone obvious (or obviously set up) and then be too blindsighted to consider the possibility that they could be mistaken or that the killer is smart enough to fake them out.2. You'll be left hanging until the last possible moment of the last book in the series, so unless the book is a one-off like a The Heiresses (and even then..), better prepare yourself by gathering up the other books in the series before starting the first one, because once you start, you'll want to binge-read until you finally get some answers.3.  The cops/detectives working the case are the most inept bunch around. And they all seem to think that teenage girls are criminal masterminds.I've read plenty of Sara Shepard books, and I've come to enjoy these 3 givens. As with the other books I've read by her, this book has its share of red herrings, and plenty of good suspects to keep me flying through the pages.  Because this is a two-parter, it ends on a cliffhanger.  Sara Shepard books are my guilty pleasure, and this one was just as fun as they usually are. I'm moving onto the second book in the 2-book ""series"" immediately so I can get some closure, but I definitely enjoyed the ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1CFJLT7U1FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062074504#wasThisHelpful","RQ1CFJLT7U1FX","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read every one of Jessica Knoll's fictional blog posts on Cosmo online, and continued over to her own website when she broke off from Cosmo, so I was pretty excited to read a full-length book from her.  I found the book to be a bit slow-moving in the beginning, and Knoll took a bit too long for my liking to make the big reveal. Despite the pacing, the book did hold my interest as it alternated chapters between Ani as a teenager trying to fit in with the popular crowd at school, and Ani as an adult, about to participate in a documentary about a tragic incident that happened to her as a teen. The book was the most intriguing when we finally found out about the incident, but there were certain elements that I didn't get enough info or closure on. Overall, an interesting read, but it wasn't as addicting as Gone Girl, to which I often here it compared. 3 1/2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CHLR2JRO3Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OITO#wasThisHelpful","R9CHLR2JRO3Y3","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't enjoy this book, mostly because I couldn't get into it. The premise sounded cute - a romantic comedy about a girl named Sarah that tries online dating - but I ultimately was bored throughout the book. I felt like Sarah was just telling us about things that happened or things people said instead of us experiencing it along with her. This was just pretty monotonous and boring, and kept me from really getting into the story. The entire book was predictable, which isn't entirely bad in chick lit, but since I didn't like the way it was written, the entire book just fell flat for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV44UKFC7NTEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIVZZ38#wasThisHelpful","RV44UKFC7NTEZ","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Second Life is a thriller about a woman who basically begins this second, secret life. As the book begins, Julia seems content with her settled-down life with her husband and teenage son. When Julia's sister Kate is murdered, it is thought that Kate could have been murdered by one of the many men she chatted with online.  Julia ends up going online to see if she can strike up a conversation with any of these men and somehow find out what happened to her sister, but she ends up veering off course and doing things that could ruin her marriage.The plot of this book was intriguing, although it wasn't as much of a thriller or mystery as I thought. While there was always the mystery of who killed Kate hanging out there, it seemed that the plot veered off course a bit to explore Julia's dalliance with a stranger she met online. The book eventually got back on course, but I felt it could have been a bit more focused. I found Julia to be pretty unlikable, and she started to really frustrate me because she also seemed a bit oblivious or dim. There were shady characters and strange occurrences that she seemed to keep brushing off or ignoring, leaving me as the reader screaming to her to wake up and get with the program.I enjoyed the mystery, but was frustrated by Julia and wished the mystery was a bit more present throughout the middle of the book. Also, I found the ending a bit rushed and it lacked the closure I like to get from my mysteries and thrillers. Despite my complaints, I still was pulled in by the plot and was hooked on finding out what happened to Kate. Overall, I'd rate it 3.*Note: I won this book for free through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSAVXEW4STFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060589#wasThisHelpful","R1DSAVXEW4STFU","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Rudd is one of my favorite actors, and I find him to be hilarious. When I heard he was going to be in Ant-Man, however, I was a little apprehensive and nervous about how Rudd would do in a superhero role. I'm not familiar with the Ant-Man comics or his origin story, but I really enjoyed the movie and thought Rudd did a great job. He seemed surprisingly agile and believable as a cat burglar-turned-superhero while bringing his personality and typical brand of humor to the role.For those unfamiliar with the movie, Scott Lang (Rudd) gets out of prison for burglary and is determined to keep things on the up-and-up and be someone his daughter (the adorable Abby Ryder Fortson) can be proud of. That soon proves to be difficult when Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits Scott to put on Pym's Ant-Man suit to shrink down, pull off a heist, and save the world.Ant-Man was a superhero I pretty much didn't know existed until news of the movie's production reached my ears a year or so back. Seeing this movie really peaked my interest in Ant-Man, and I can't wait to see more of him. A superhero modeled after an ant was surprisingly interesting, enjoyable, and exciting. But, the best part of the movie for me was actually Michael Pena, who played Scott's friend Luis. Pena had some great one-liners, and he stole every scene he was in. The movie as a whole was humorous, and obviously Rudd was funny, but Pena was just such a fun surprise for me, and I couldn't get enough of him.Overall, I thought this movie was really enjoyable. It was a little different, and I enjoyed seeing more about a superhero that was previously unknown to me, rather than seeing another superhero movie about am oversaturated character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3OM2QMKYYM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGDIGZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1F3OM2QMKYYM6","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because of Amy Schumer's sense of humor, I went into Trainwreck expecting a raunchy comedy. There was definitely some raunchy and inappropriate humor that you would expect from a movie written by and starring Amy Schumer (not to mention directed by Judd Apatow), but the movie was more touching and had more substance than I expected. It was basically a romantic comedy, but with more heart than I'm used to seeing. The film centers around Amy, a woman who enjoys playing the field and doesn't want to settle down. She constantly makes fun of the domestic life her sister Kim (Brie Larson) leads. There are some greatly funny scenes with Amy, Kim, Kim's husband Tom (Mike Birbiglia), and Tom's son Allister (Evan Brinkman, who I've never seen before, but thought was adorable). Colin Quinn plays Amy and Kim's father, who ingrained in Amy early on that monogamy wasn't realistic. Amy, a magazine writer, then has to interview a sports doctor (Bill Hader) for an article she's assigned to write and starts to develop feelings for him, which is in contrast with her entire way of living.Trainwreck is the first movie Apatow has directed that he hasn't written, but it still had an Apatow feel to it. I read somewhere that Schumer wrote the script with Apatow in mind to direct, so she wrote in things that she knew he would like, and I definitely felt Apatow shone threw in aspects of the plot. Overall, the movie was a bit long and slow-moving in parts, but that's par for the course when you're going into any Apatow film. Despite this, it was still funny and enjoyable and felt fresh.  Amy Schumer seems to be the current It Girl of the moment, and I think with this movie, she'll stick around awhile. I wouldn't be surprised to see future Apatow/Schumer collaborations, which I would definitely see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE71EP82X32Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U0JWMK#wasThisHelpful","RE71EP82X32Y5","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Birth is about a women with a young child, and her struggles with trying to care for her baby while dealing with loneliness and depression. The narrator tells us about her daily life raising her 1-year-old while trying to make friends with another new mom, but backtracks to talk about her love life and troubled childhood.I enjoyed the writing style of this book, and the almost stream-of-consciousness way of the book. I found it to be well written, but there was just something about the plot that turned me off a bit. At times I found the book interesting, and at other times it was boring, or honestly even a bit scary to anyone contemplating having a baby. (However - maybe for women who HAVE had children, they can relate to the narrator's feelings.) Because I went back and forth about how I felt about it, it's hard for me to rate it. I think because of that, I'm giving it a 3, as I kept waffling between a 2 at times and even a 4 at other times. My complaints aside, I think this would make an interesting book club book, because this seems like a book that will dredge up lots of thoughts and opinions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZ4912U9OE1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544273737#wasThisHelpful","R1DZ4912U9OE1V","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this book was a great continuation of the story that began with Pines, and I may have even enjoyed this book more than the previous one. There seemed to be more action, and I think the fact that I already knew the main secret behind Wayward Pines made it easier for me to enjoy this book, as I was able to sit back and enjoy the book, as flashbacks occurred and answers to other mysteries unfolded.

"The plot of Terminator Genisys basically revolves around John Connor (Jason Clarke) sending Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to save John's mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke, no relation in real life to Jason Clarke). Sounds pretty familiar to us Terminator fans, right? What Genisys does is builds on the plots in the previous films by keeping the main plot similar to the first movie, but having Kyle meet with an altered timeline in 1984. This Sarah is much different from the Sarah he was expecting (and much different from the Sarah we saw in the original film) in that she's already a bad-A and knows all about Kyle being sent back to save her and the Resistance and the war against the machines. In fact, she's been being trained by the reprogrammed T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) for many years prior to Kyle showing up.You know in Back to the Future 2 when Marty goes back to 1955 Hill Valley for the almanac and you see the other Marty (from the first Back to the Future) trying to do his thing and get his parents back together? So you have a new movie but still get to see events from the first movie again, like the Enchantment Under the Sea dance scenes?  Every time I watch BTTF2, getting to revisit and experience that scene from a different perspective than the first movie makes me so excited, and Terminator Genisys made me feel that same way at times.  I've seen all of the Terminator movies multiple times, mostly because my husband is a huge fan of the franchise. They're all enjoyable to an extent (some more than others), but, to be honest, it's been a couple of years since I've watched the previous movies. Even without having seen the other movies in the series recently, I still enjoyed Genisys and have to say that I don't think it's necessary to have seen the previous films recently, or at all. That being said, I do think it could be beneficial and add to your experience to watch or rewatch them before seeing Genisys. The parts about this film that I thought were the most fun were when we got to revisit scenes or hear similar lines from the previous films. It brought the nostalgia factor way up for me, which I loved. There were some things I missed that I didn't realize were nods back to previous films in the series, until my husband leaned over and whispered to me about them, so it doesn't hurt to rewatch the series beforehand, or at least the first two. Again, not necessary, but could amp up your enjoyment.Bottom line - I've always enjoyed science fiction and time travel movies, and this one was a winner in my book. I honestly thought this movie was great. It was action-packed but also pretty funny. It was nostalgic while still being inventive and feeling fresh. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected and had a really fun time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZ2C244K5XK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R40EUY#wasThisHelpful","R2VZ2C244K5XK6","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ted 2 picks up a few years after the events of the first movie. John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is divorced from Lori and Ted wants him to get back on the horse and start dating again. Ted and Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) have married and want to have a child. When they look into adoption, it is discovered that Ted is recognized as property, not a person, under the law. Ted, John, and Tami-Lynn team up with Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), an amateur civil rights attorney who has no experience.The first time I saw Ted, I laughed so hard I cried. Ted 2 was amusing and funny, but definitely not as funny as the first. It did have some funny moments, and I enjoyed having the gang back together, but I missed Mila Kunis, who apparently didn't reprise her role because of her pregnancy. I wish the pregnancy had just been written into the movie, however, because I felt there was something missing in this movie without her. Despite the lack of Kunis, Sam Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, and Patrick Warburton reprised their roles in this film.For fans of the first, Ted 2 can be an enjoyable watch, but it certainly doesn't match up to the first one. (And if the first movie wasn't your type of humor, then you may as well skip this one altogether.)  All in all, a decent watch but just good and not great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M9CBKT9R4H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAOHCQQ#wasThisHelpful","R2M9CBKT9R4H9","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first question people ask me when they find out I saw Jurassic World is whether or not it was better than the original. In my opinion, Jurassic World isn't better than the other movies in the series, but it stands on its own pretty well and was just as much fun to watch as the others. I saw the movie two days in a row and can acknowledge that there are some plot issues. While the plot wasn't as tight as some of the previous ones, this movie was certainly just as entertaining to me.In this movie, Jurassic World is a successful theme park on Isla Nublar, the site of the original Jurassic Park. In order to continually attract visitors, the theme park comes up with new attractions every couple of years. The latest attraction is a genetically modified dinosaur called Indominus Rex, which was created to be bigger and badder and scarier than T Rex.The only character from any of the previous movies in the series to reprise his role in this movie is BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, the scientist who created the Indominus Rex. The new cast includes Zack (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids taking a vacation to Jurassic World to visit their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park operations manager. Chris Pratt plays Owen Grady, the trainer of 4 velociraptors who think Pratt is their alpha (this comes into play later in the movie).  Rounding out the cast is Vincent D'Onofrio as Vic, the security head, Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as control room employees, and Irrfan Khan as Simon Misrani, the owner of the park. Misrani wants Owen to evaluate Indominus' enclosure to see if he sees any safety issues that everyone else is overlooking. The action of this movie kicks off (and never stops) when Indominus escapes her cage and begins to run rampant on the island.This movie was full of action and so much fun to watch. I rewatched Jurassic Park about a year ago when they re-released it in theaters and I was impressed by how decent the dinosaurs and special effects were, even 20 years later, but I wondered at that time what the dinosaurs could look like in today's movie-making world. World obviously answered that question for me. Not only were the dinosaurs pretty amazing, but the island and entire theme park were visually pleasing as well. The futuristic elements of the theme park were pretty fun to see.  There was also a fun, nostalgic nod to the first movie when they come across the original park, although I wish the original park would've been a bit more recognizable.Overall, the movie was incredibly fun and I absolutely loved it. I loved the choice of casting Chris Pratt as the male lead, I found Jake Johnson to add some great moments of comic relief, and I really enjoyed Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the two kids in this movie. There were some ridiculous parts of the plot (one of them being the fact that Claire wears heels throughout the ENTIRE movie, while trekking through the woods and running from dinosaurs). There was also a weird subplot I didn't care for because it didn't seem fleshed out enough that involved Vic wanting to use dinosaurs as weapons of war. However, I didn't go into this movie expecting total realism. I wanted a fun, sci-fi escape with some cool-looking dinosaurs and some great action, and that's exactly what I got. I saw this movie two days in a row, and the action and excitement continued to hold up  (and even the weak plot points were fun to watch and amusing to make fun of on repeat viewings).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L08C408KZEPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHWD78I#wasThisHelpful","R3L08C408KZEPI","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was...not my favorite. First off, it was hard to even figure out what the plot was about, because it seemed to continually change. At first it seemed like it was going to be about a woman in an emotionally abusive relationship, then that storyline seemed to be dropped and it was about a woman potentially struggling with mental illness, then the plot morphed again and it was about a seemingly perfect assistant who may have ulterior motives. All in all, I didn't find the plot (or plots, rather) very entertaining. Besides the dull plot, I found the characters all to be pretty unlikable, even the main character, and I found many of the main character's actions to be unrealistic. I was honestly surprised while reading the book that this was a Jane Green novel because her books normally pull me in right away and are hard to put down. Better luck next time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAEJ9PU5RFJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047331#wasThisHelpful","R1WAEJ9PU5RFJM","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an immense Back to the Future (BTTF, from here on out) fan, I ate this book up. I'm obsessed with the BTTF trilogy and never tire of watching the movies. I always knew that I wasn't alone in this sentiment, but this book made me realize just how big the BTTF fan-base is.  The fact that the movies really are far-reaching and touch people so powerfully is what led to the films' successes in the 80s, and made the movies the classics they are today. I never tire of watching any movies in the Back to the Future trilogy or looking up facts about the movies, so I was pretty excited to read this book. It offered a great behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, including interviews with many cast and crew members and inside looks at how certain scenes were filmed or special effects accomplished. There were some stories or facts that I had already heard, but I was surprised by the amount of information contained in this book that I was previously unfamiliar with. This is a great read for any BTTF fan. I flew through this book and only put it down so I could watch the trilogy in between.Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review through the Penguin First to Read giveaway program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPUXL2HDA8QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142181536#wasThisHelpful","R1TPUXL2HDA8QA","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the English translation of this Danish book that is apparently 7th in a series about Louise Rick, who, in this book, is the commander of a new police unit focusing on missing persons. Sometimes it's hard to jump into the middle of a series, but I didn't read any previous books in this series and didn't find this book hard to come into at all. I really enjoyed the characters, and wouldn't mind reading the other books in the series to get more background on the characters, but I don't think it's necessary for one to read the others before picking this book up.In this book, Louise's first case in this newly created department involves a dead woman that is found in the woods. Once she is identified, Louise and her partner find out that there is a death certificate for this woman showing that she supposedly died many years earlier. From there they try to figure out why someone may have faked her death, all while trying to deal with more and more crimes that are happening in the same woods this woman was found in. I really enjoyed the mystery of this novel, and found the book to be fast-paced the entire way through. Can't wait to read another book by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TY9JXLZ1EF3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455581526#wasThisHelpful","R3TY9JXLZ1EF3H","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book for free through the Kindle First program and found it to be a fast and easy read with an okay storyline about Olivia, a workaholic living in New York City. Olivia's life is upset when her sister and brother-in-law die and Olivia is named in her sister's will to raise their baby. Olivia goes back to her hometown for a few weeks to figure out what she's going to do about her infant niece and runs into Brad, her old high school boyfriend who also happened to be her sister's brother-in-law. I thought the plot was interesting, but the book was too cheesy and predictable for me. A lot of the issues were manufactured because of lack of communication. Also, it didn't develop the relationship between Olivia and Brad well enough for me. First they hate each other, then they all of a sudden love each other with no real development or substance going into the relationship. We kept being told about the fact that they previously dated, but we never really found out any details about that relationship, other than details about their love life. This book was decent, but so, so cheesy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24F5087M1UOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477829067#wasThisHelpful","R24F5087M1UOV","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~3 1/2 stars. This book was confusing in the beginning because it jumps around a LOT.  At first, I was constantly flipping back and forth to re-read parts and almost thought about writing out a timeline so I could keep better track of the dates that various events occurred on. But...once I got about 50 pages or so in, it was much easier to follow the story, and the jumping around didn't seem as excessive. It seemed like the jumping back and forth in the timeline slowed down a bit, or perhaps I just got used to this. Either way, this was an entertaining story. Without giving too much away (because you don't really know exactly what's going on until the plot sneaks up on you), this book is told from the perspective of Annie. She's getting around to telling us about an indiscretion of hers, but to do that she has to tell us about her past, and about her present life, and about her life right before and after the indiscretion, so we fully understand.I found this book to be really intriguing, and I liked how the story unfolded and revealed various aspects of Annie's life. I thought the characters were well-developed, and I enjoyed the way this book was written. At times I grew a bit weary of the purposeful mystery or withholding of plot details to build up suspense or interest, but as a whole, I thought this method worked very well. An interesting read, and different from what I've read recently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZIGTY04HLU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995449#wasThisHelpful","RPZIGTY04HLU6","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a non-fashion-y person, I picked up this book because I thought it would be humorous plus give me some tips on how to dress better or be more fashionable. It wasn't really a humorous book, and I didn't get too many fashion tips that I could apply to my daily life on a normal person's budget, but it was an interesting memoir about a woman in the fashion industry. Since I know nearly nothing about the fashion world, I found some parts of this book to be fun and interesting, and other parts to be a bit slower.I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I don't know much about fashion. I like to look nice, but don't know the names of many designers, besides those brands that I can get at Target, Kohl's, and Macy's.  That being said, I'm not sure if the author is a big name or not, but she certainly seems to have either really good luck, really good connections, or both. She had some incredible stories that you almost couldn't believe - and I don't mean that in a rude way, like I'm speculating that they aren't true. I don't doubt their authenticity at all.  I just mean that some of these stories are crazy.  For instance, the matre d' of her parents' favorite restaurant introduces her to a photographer she greatly admires that happens to be dining in the restaurant, and she manages to land a job with him out of it.  In another instance, the person who owns the art gallery she had just sent a resume to just so happens to walk into the shoe shop she's in and starts a conversation with her.  OR - better yet - she goes to a weekend wedding and sees the girlfriend of a college friend, who brings her to this great shoe shop (Christian Louboutin's).  She splurges on a pair of shoes to wear to the wedding, where Christian himself is a guest who befriends her and dances with her all night because he can't believe she could dance so much in his shoes.There were a lot of incredible stories like that in the book that I think that fashion aficionados in particular would enjoy. For me, I enjoyed parts, but was bored in other areas. I also got a bit tired of what seemed like constant name-dropping. If I were more into fashion, I think I would have enjoyed this more. Regardless, it was an easy read, and I loved the great pictures interspersed throughout.Note: I received this book for free through the Penguin First to Read giveaway program.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23L92ES4HBJAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170839#wasThisHelpful","R23L92ES4HBJAC","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you haven't watched any of the My Drunk Kitchen videos, I would suggest first suggest YouTubing them before picking up the cookbook, to get an idea of what you're in for. If you find the videos amusing and you're looking for more of that, this book is a fun read. If you're looking for an actual cookbook, this book won't really help you. This book is filled with great pictures, puns, and humorous write-ups by Hannah Hart, along with numerous ""recipes"", which are usually just adaptations of normal meals made from whatever products are readily available in her kitchen. I think that Hannah Hart's online videos are hilarious, but her humor and quirkiness doesn't translate very well to cookbook form.

"I'm not normally a fan of short stories, but I found this read to be really enjoyable. I usually need time to get into a story, so I don't see the point of many short stories, which is why I'm typically not a fan. These stories, however, were really well-developed and entertaining. It had me wondering if I've just been reading the wrong type of short stories, or stories by the wrong authors. Most of these stories took place in the same fictional Massachusetts town, and some of them had interconnecting characters, which kind of made me feel like I was in on an inside joke, since I recognized the people or names from a previous story in the collection. Each story drew me in right away and I found this collection to be enjoyable and well-written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3WMSJ3A9X3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316297224#wasThisHelpful","RU3WMSJ3A9X3Y","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wasn't a huge fan of some of the questions asked, and wasn't sure if it was just the interviewer's style, or just the fact that something is lost a little bit when you're just reading the transcription of a lengthy interview.

"Amnesia was a bit...confusing. The book jacket description makes it seem like it's about a terrorist attack where a hacker unleashed a worm that released the locks on prisons in the U.S. and Australia. Like most people, I picked up the book because the plot description on the book sounded intriguing. Unfortunately, the book wasn't about this terrorist attack at all. It's actually about a disgraced journalist named Felix Moore, who has recently been found libel for slander and is talked into writing a novel about the suspected terrorist, painting her in a flattering light. For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me (because the book was very, very confusing) he is isolated for his safety and only given tapes from the terrorist and her mom dictating their stories to Felix.Most of the book was about this suspected terrorist's upbringing, and we learn about it through the unreliable dictation of the terrorist herself and her mother. Besides the fact that Felix is writing this book to show that the hacker either did or didn't do this crime, the book isn't actually about this terrorist attack at all. It was just about Felix listening to tapes and writing this book, and if that sounds boring, then it's because it kind of is.I wasn't impressed with this book and was bored throughout much of it. I would have loved to have learned more about the terrorist attack, as that plot actually sounded intriguing. Instead I slogged through the book, just waiting to get to the plot detailed on the book jacket, but that never came. Overall I was annoyed about the ""bait-and-switch"" with the plot, bored with the actual plot, and confused by what I was given.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E05N3A5QS5MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352778#wasThisHelpful","R3E05N3A5QS5MZ","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While We're Young stars Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts as a couple in their forties that befriend a younger couple (Amanda Seyfried and Adam Driver), shaking up their lives and their normal routine. The movie is part comedy, part drama, but it almost seemed like it was split into two different movies for me. The first part of the movie was definitely comedy, with some really funny and humorous jokes playing off of the age difference, and the fact that Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts are trying to be like these young hipster kids. The second half of the movie was more of a drama, and it started to drag a little for me.I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but there were things that I liked and things that I didn't like about it. I felt it was a little long and slow-moving in parts, and I also found the climax to be a bit anticlimactic.Maria Dizzia and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) played a more age-appropriate couple of friends to Stiller and Watts, and I found the few scenes they were in to be the most enjoyable. Because I liked the movie and I didn't at the same time, I'm rating it 3 stars. I left the movie not sure exactly what it was trying to be. Some scenes were a little long and drawn out, and I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it hadn't been quite so plodding, and if the pacing of the film for the first half and the second half had been a bit more consistent.  Despite my critiques, I did enjoy the movie and would recommend seeing it. I really liked the casting in this movie, and thought each of the couples had chemistry with each other and one another.

"If you've read any of Sara Shepard's books before, you know what to expect from her: fun female characters, murder, and lots of secrets. The Heiresses was no different. We first get to know 5 cousins, granddaughters of a huge diamond jeweler magnate. When one of the cousins (or heiresses) is murdered, and it is staged to look like a suicide, the 4 remaining cousins try to track down whodunnit, while uncovering more and more secrets along the way.This book was fun and fast-paced (a little cheesy or unrealistic, too) but Sara Shepard's books are so enjoyable because they're addicting, especially when she sucks you into a mystery and keeps slipping in more and more secrets. It was hard to put down the book because I wanted to find out answers to all of these crazy secrets. I enjoyed this book a bit more than her Pretty Little Liars and The Lying Game series because it was more of a stand-alone book, so we actually got answers in this book instead of being strung along throughout a whole series before getting the closure we needed.

Lillian ends up surviving the crash, only to end up stuck on a deserted island with chauvinistic pilot Kent and kind PR rep Dave.This book jumps back in forth in alternating chapters between the time Lillian and Dave spend on the island trying to survive, and present day, after they were rescued and now are trying to move on from their experiences. In present day, both are giving a TV interview with a reporter that seems to suspect they're hiding something.

However, I ultimately found it a bit underwhelming. It frustrated me that everything seemed to conveniently keep working out okay overall, and I thought the secrets Lily and Dave kept were blown out of proportion a little and not as bad as they made them seen, given the circumstances.

"This book is fuzzy at times and slow at revealing details and explaining itself, but the gist of the plot is that it's about Jake Whyte, a young sheep farmer with a shady background and even shadier acquaintances. The story is told in alternating chapters, with one chapter being narrated in past tense what is happening presumably in present day, where Jake Whyte's sheep keep getting killed and strange things happen around her house. The opposite chapters are told in present tense, and detail what happened to Jake before she became a sheep farmer. Her mysterious past is slowly unfolded in these chapters, however, they're told in reverse chronological order. Think Memento, but in book-form.At first I found the book confusing, before I realized that the structure of the book was alternating chapters with some going forward and the others going backward. Even once I figured this out, the book was still confusing and hard to follow at times. I began to really enjoy the storyline once I was several chapters in, but ultimately the conclusion of the book was a disappointment to me. I kept waiting for the alternating chapters to finally come together and clear up a lot of the mystery and confusion about Jake's life, but I didn't end up getting the closure that I wanted from this book. I found the book to be well-written and it's clear to me the author can write, however I wasn't as absorbed in the tale as I wanted to be, because of my confusion and frustration as the alternating chapters continued on.

"The premise of this book is that our narrator is a writer going to Athens to teach a weeklong writing class. Throughout the week, she has conversations with many different people, from her neighbor on the plane to another teacher to old friends in Athens to students in her class. The book is told as if the narrator is relating to us everything these people tell her, which at first was interesting and different. However, this technique began to grow a bit old as the book went on, because basically I was just hearing bits and pieces about people's lives or random stories they were telling our narrator, rather than experiencing anything myself. Essentially, the book went something like, he said this, I said this, he said this, and on and on..

"The Loft is apparently a remake of a Dutch film, with both being directed by Erik Van Looy. I've heard of this happening a few times before now, but I always find it interesting that the same director would be involved in both films. I'd be interested to see the original Loft movie to see how it compares to this remake and what changes Van Looy made (if any).  But, since I haven't seen the original, I can't speak to that. So.. The Loft is about 5 married men that share a secret penthouse apartment that they use to see women and carry out affairs without their wives knowing. This movie is a thriller/whodunnit-style of movie, with the whodunnit starting when one of the men discover a dead women in the apartment. Since only the 5 men (James Marsden, Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, and Matthias Shoenaerts) have keys and know about this apartment, they try to determine which of them killed this woman and what to do, since none of them want their wives finding out about the apartment.There were a lot of twists and turns to this movie, and the plot was unveiled in an interesting way as it jumped back and forth between them discovering the body, them being interviewed by police, and back to earlier times when they were renting the apartment and carrying on these affairs.  Despite the plot twists, I didn't think this movie was much of a thinker, which was fine by me because then I could just check out and enjoy the movie without having to put forth much effort into trying to follow a difficult storyline.Overall, I thought the movie was enjoyable. It had an interesting premise and I liked it, however, it would have been more enjoyable and more ""thrilling"" had certain parts made more sense. There were a few ideas that weren't fully explored or explained, resulting in some plot holes that I thought could have been cleaned up a bit.The most glaring issue to me that drove me crazy was that the men's main means of renting or buying this apartment wasn't fully explained. The thought behind having this secret apartment was so the men wouldn't have hotel and restaurant receipts to clue their wives in on their affairs, but the movie never addressed how they paid for this apartment without their wives knowing about it or becoming suspicious, nor does the movie address why the wives aren't suspicious when their husbands don't come home at night (unless it's during the day..or they say they're away on business..or maybe the wives are out of town..?) There were also a few details regarding a realtor and Wentworth Miller's character that I didn't feel were fully resolved or explained enough to my liking.Overall, a decent movie, but it definitely could have been improved upon, in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22MQ04SKASR1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTDAGO#wasThisHelpful","R22MQ04SKASR1C","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really interesting and unique book. It was a true story made out to be a fiction novel, or perhaps, a fiction novel made out to be a true story. Basically, the author or narrator (depending on whether or not this is a true story or fictionalization) describes the case of a man that signed a confession admitting to the abduction and murder of several people in a Japanese town. Once he's arrested, he refuses to talk. Doesn't talk to investigators, doesn't talk to his attorney, doesn't talk to his family. He doesn't talk while in jail, doesn't talk while on trial, doesn't talk after the trial. The narrator, decades later, hears about the case and tracks down details and answers to the many questions surrounding this bizarre case, resulting in this book.I found this book to be really inventive and interesting. It was a super quick read that sucked me in right away, with the true-crime-esque portrayal. There were parts of the story or book that frustrated me, especially if the crime story is, in fact, fiction (as I believe it must be..). Detailing my frustrations here would just spoil the book, and I wouldn't want to do that, as I still found it really interesting. Definitely worth a read.I'd give this between 3 1/2 and 4 stars, but because of how fast it pulled me in, how unique I found it to be, and how much I'm still thinking about it, I'm rating it as a 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYS5MJFAN6JVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345805526#wasThisHelpful","RYS5MJFAN6JVM","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, students basically try to understand what their philosophy professor is saying, which is honestly what I thought throughout most of the book. However, the students in the book mostly wanted to say or do something to impress him, but I couldn't understand why because I was mostly bored by his philosophical musings. Critics seemed to really enjoy this book, so I realize I risk upsetting people when I say that I found this book pretentious and confusing. The end of the book couldn't come soon enough for me. This book just wasn't my cup of tea and I didn't find it at all entertaining.  I took a few philosophy and logic courses in college, but couldn't make heads or tales out of many of ""Wittgenstein Jr's"" musings.  I would recommend skipping the book, unless you have a deep enjoyment and understanding of philosophy and logic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE9ASWXBB8X6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IW4DOI6#wasThisHelpful","RGE9ASWXBB8X6","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taken 3 was more like the first Taken than the second was, which was just what I was hoping for. It certainly wasn't as good or entertaining as the first, but I ended up really liking it. Before I get further into this review, however, I must point out that, before seeing this movie (or the first Taken, for that matter), you have to suspend disbelief. Obviously there are many moments where you think, well this couldn't POSSIBLY happen. If you can set that aside, then Taken 3 is pretty entertaining.In this movie, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) goes out for bagels in anticipation of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) coming over. When he returns a short while later, Lenore is dead in his bed. Cops show up before he can do anything and try to bring Bryan in, and of course, Bryan isn't just going to go with them. He escapes and continues to kick butt for the rest of the movie, trying to track down the person or people who framed him, while also trying to avoid the police. Maggie Grace is back as Kim, Bryan's daughter, but Lenore's husband Stuart is now played by Dougray Scott, unlike the first Taken, where Stuart was played by Xander Berkeley. In addition to a new actor playing Stuart, this new Stuart isn't as likable as the Stuart in the first Taken. In the first movie, I found his character to be well-meaning and he seemed to be a supportive, stable husband to Lenore. In this one, he just seems like a jerk at times and kind of slimy.Other characters in this movie include Malankov (Sam Spruell), a baddie that Stuart owes money to, and Maxim (Andrew Howard), Malankov's main cronie.  Bryan's old CIA buddies Sam (Leland Orser),  and Casey (Jon Gries, who will always be Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite in my eyes) return for this movie, and help Bryan out along the way. And, of course, Forest Whitaker plays Franck Dotzler, the detective trying to bring Bryan in and crack Lenore's murder.I already mentioned that one needed to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this movie, but I feel that needs to be put out there again. Taken 3 is definitely far-fetched and downright ridiculous at times, but so was Taken, and that's part of what makes the movie so fun, in my opinion. For instance, there's one scene toward the beginning of the movie when Bryan flees from the cops and then discovers a surveillance tape showing Lenore being abducted.  Cops catch up to Bryan, who doesn't bother to say, ""Hey - I didn't do it!! Look at the surveillance tape!!"" Even when cops do look at the surveillance tape, they're still focusing solely on Bryan, despite the fact that a surveillance tape shows her being abducted by someone that is clearly not Bryan. Sigh. However, had the plot been strictly believable, we wouldn't have even had a movie.As it was, I found the movie fun and fast-paced. There were some great action scenes and neat explosions. Liam Neeson had some amazing fight scenes in the movie, and I read that he filmed all his own fight scenes, which is pretty impressive for a 60-year-old man. I thought this was a worthy sequel. It's not as good as Taken, but if you liked that movie and like Neeson, and obviously if you have an open mind that isn't looking for the most realistic plot, then this is an enjoyable watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPXECJDG90YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ735W4#wasThisHelpful","RDPXECJDG90YF","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you really liked the first Hot Tub Time Machine, then this sequel is worth seeing. I saw it with someone who hadn't seen the first one and they thought this one was pretty funny and enjoyable as a stand-alone movie, but this movie certainly doesn't top the first, in my opinion.In this movie, Lou (Rob Corddry), Nick (Craig Robinson), and Jacob (Clark Duke) go back in time to try to prevent someone from killing Lou. Instead they somehow end up in an alternate timeline at some point in the future, where they continue trying to track down Lou's attempted killer. Unfortunately, John Cusack wasn't in this sequel, and he was greatly missed.  The movie brought in Adam Scott to play John Cusack's son, and there were some nods and references to John Cusack's character, but it wasn't the same for me. I felt like something was lacking or missing without him, or maybe it's just that sequels rarely ever live up to the original.Despite the lack of Cusack, I thought the movie was funny, and had some amusing tongue-in-cheek jokes about the fact that it was a sequel. Many, but not all, of the jokes in the movie were ones we had already seen in the trailers, but I still laughed in the context of the movie, and there were some other funny laughs throughout. Overall, the movie was humorous, and I enjoyed having the gang back together. But, I absolutely loved the first movie and didn't think this held a candle to the original. Plus, John Cusack was missed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OL335BHRXIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTRBYS2#wasThisHelpful","R19OL335BHRXIS","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sophie Diehl is the attorney Mia wants to handle her divorce, but Sophie is a criminal lawyer that's never handled a divorce case before, and Sophie would much rather be trying a murder case than this divorce.The plot of this book is told entirely through correspondence - memos, emails, letters, court documents, etc. I've seen this writing method before and sometimes find it gets old, but for this book I enjoyed it and thought it worked pretty well.  I found this book to be pretty cute, despite the fact that it was a divorce story and not a love story. Sophie and Mia were both a little quirky with funny antics at times that made me laugh.

"Kingsman was like a mix between a James Bond movie and Kick-Ass. It seemed campy at times, in the way that I find the Batman TV series from the 60s to be, but with a lot more blood. I thought the movie was weird and funny and entertaining, but it wouldn't be for everyone. There was definitely a lot of violence, but it was played up or glamorized in a funny way that not everyone will find appealing. However, if you (like me) enjoyed Kick-Ass and you like spy movies, this would probably be a good fit.The movie is about an ultra-secret spy organization that is recruiting a new member, or Kingsman. Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, a Kingsman spy that nominates a punk kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) as one of the recruits competing for the open spy slot. Eggsy and other recruits go head to head in a series of tests, with the winner getting to join the Kingsman organization.  Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head of the Kingsmen, with Mark Strong as Merlin, another Kingsman that is helping test the recruits.  Meanwhile, we have an uber-rich internet mogul named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and his employee/assistant/assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) that are up to something evil, although we don't quite know what it is until we get further into the movie.The movie was goofy in a good way, and I found it to be a really fun and quirky spy movie.  It wasn't your typical spy movie, and I loved how different it was. If you're familiar with Matthew Vaughn, the director and screenwriter (with Jane Goldman) and his previous work (which includes Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class), you'll find this similar in style. It was comedic and had a comic book feel, but was quirky and different too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24W36YG9NNJ00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJYY42S#wasThisHelpful","R24W36YG9NNJ00","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The consensus among most people talking about this book seems to be that you'll either love it or hate it. I didn't LOVE the book, but I didn't have strong enough feelings about it to hate it.  This book didn't really stir up much of an opinion in me either way. It was fine but not great and there wasn't anything in particular that I thought was awful or boring, but I also didn't find it the most exciting either. However, at times there were some parts that were definitely amusing.It's hard for me to figure out how to describe the book, other than it was similar to a stream-of-consciousness type of narrative.  The book was choppy and told tidbits or little pieces of a story a paragraph or two at a time, but altogether told the story of one couple's marriage. This was definitely a fast read, and I wasn't able to read this in one sitting, but I was able to start and finish it in one day. Overall, an interesting and worthwhile book. Even if you hate it, it's a quick read and pretty unique.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5H4CV1M9I9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1W0DV8#wasThisHelpful","RX5H4CV1M9I9P","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first - I have no idea who Kim Stoltz is. I picked up this book because I saw the title and thought it would be a funny memoir, possibly about someone's dating life. Instead, it's more of an exploration of the author's digital-obsessed life.Kim Stoltz apparently was a contestant on America's Next Top Model and also was (is?) on MTV. I don't recall ever seeing her on MTV and I don't watch America's Next Top Model, so I wasn't aware that this book was by a reality star. If you're familiar with Stoltz or are a fan, you may enjoy this book a little more than I did, but I don't think the fact that I was unfamiliar with her took away from the book at all. Again, it wasn't really a memoir but more a look into the technology-obsessed society we live in today.Stoltz brings up some good thoughts and ideas in this book, and definitely made me think about giving up my smart phone, or at least finally take strides to become slightly less dependent and obsessed with it. The book was a bit repetitive at times, but had a relevant message.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174S3TP9RC8XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB30C#wasThisHelpful","R174S3TP9RC8XJ","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I could NOT put down this book. It pulled me in right away and I had to read at every free moment I had so I could find out what was going on and what was going to happen.To back up - tons of oddities begin happening around the world. Gruesome murders and suicides begin to increase in frequency until they're happening everywhere, all the time. People aren't quite sure what's going on but they think it's because of some unknown thing or creature or something that causes you to go crazy shortly after you see it. People start hiding out in their houses with the windows covered, refusing to go outside unless their eyes are covered and instead staying cooped up indoors with no end in sight (excuse the pun).This book jumps back and forth between present day and a period about 5 years earlier when this epidemic (or whatever it is) began. In the present, Malorie is alone in a house with her two 4-year-old children and is planning an escape from her house to try to go farther down the river, but it'll be dangerous since she and her children will have to keep their eyes covered the entire time and Malorie doesn't know what's out there. In the storyline 5 years prior, we get to see how all of this begins and how Malorie, newly pregnant, manages to survive up to the present.The suspense and tension and creepiness in this book just kept building and building, partly because you didn't exactly know what was going on and what the evil or creature was, so your imagination made things worse.  I was caught in a vicious cycle while reading this because I would stay up super late because I couldn't put the book down...but then I would creep myself out thinking what could be going on outside and then I couldn't sleep...so then I'd read some more to make me tired...which obviously didn't work, so I ended up reading the whole thing in about 2 days. This book was really absorbing and seemed totally original. I also thought it was great the entire way through, which is a hard feat because some thrillers or horror stories start off good but then disappoint at the ending. This book didn't disappoint at the end, but I'm one of those readers that want exactly every little thing explained, and this book didn't address every last detail, so I can't give it 5 stars. But - a great read throughout!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEN9744YLTW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ352U6#wasThisHelpful","R3DEN9744YLTW5","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Usually I have a lot to say after seeing a movie; whether that be positive or negative. For this movie, I don't have much to say. Rather than go into an in-depth review when there are plenty of better reviews already written for this movie, I'll be brief in my thoughts on this movie.I found the story to be really touching, but it was obviously hard to watch at times, particularly  knowing these events actually happened.  For Angelina Jolie's first directing gig, I was surprised. I didn't expect much out of her, and while this movie had some areas to be improved upon, overall I thought she did a good job. The movie was a little long and dragged at times, but there was a lot of amazing parts of Louis Zamperini's story to tell, so I can understand how it might be hard to choose what to keep in and what to omit. I thought the acting was powerful, and would highly recommend seeing this movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKN040S4PBP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTDC9O#wasThisHelpful","RCKN040S4PBP4","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I went to see Into the Woods, I didn't really know what to expect. I haven't seen the play and I've only seen about half of one trailer for the movie. All I knew about the movie was that it was a musical, it was Disney, it had Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick (!!, in my book), and it was about fairy tales or something.The plot kind of weaves together several well-known fairy tales (I believe they're all Grimm fairy tales, which I love and have read and re-read many times, but everyone knows the Disney adaptations of these fairy tales a bit more than the original Grimm versions). In the beginning of the movie, it made me feel like a kid, excitedly recognizing this character and fairy tale story and that one. A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) can't have children due to a spell the witch next door (Meryl Streep) put on their house. In order for her to reverse the spell, the baker and his wife need to track down 4 items. The movie has a cute song detailing which items are needed, but put more simply, the baker needs to track down Cinderella's slipper, Red Riding Hood's cape, Jack (of Jack and the Giant fame)'s white cow, and Rapunzel's hair.  This movie meshed together these fairy tales with this new story of the baker and his wife, and it's a pretty cute, original take. Besides Streep, Corden, and Blunt, the cast had many familiar faces, like Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Chris Pine as Prince Charming, Johnny Depp as The Wolf, Tracey Ullman as Jack's mother, Frances de la Tour as the Giant, Christine Baranski as Cinderella's Stepmother, and Lucy Punch as one of Cinderella's stepsisters. Also starring in this movie (although not known to me before this movie, but possibly known to others) are Daniel Huttlestone as Jack, Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood, Billy Magnussen as Rapunzel's prince, and Mackenzie Mauzy as Rapunzel.Again, I haven't seen the musical, so I can't make comparisons here between the movie and the play. I can't tell you if the movie stays true to the musical or if it's better or worse or anything like that.  As far as the songs in the movie are concerned, there were some songs in this movie that I really liked, and others that were a bit boring and dragged on. In fact, the movie in general seemed to drag on. There was a fake-out ending where everything comes together nicely and you think the movie is coming to a close, before something happens and then the movie drags on for another 45 minutes or so. At 2 hours and 5 minutes, I felt while watching the movie that it was a bit too long.  It plodded and dragged on at times, and there were a few times that I was simply bored.Also, for a Disney movie about fairy tales that's rated PG, I didn't think this was the best family movie pick. It was a bit dark at times, and again, the length and tedium at times probably wouldn't hold the interest of younger children. Some of the songs and familiar characters are sure to entice kids, but there will likely be a few times during the movie that they start squirming in their seats because of a boring song or slow spot. (I was even doing that at times, wondering how long the movie was going to be.)Overall, I thought the plot of the movie was really interesting and unique, but the movie was also unnecessarily long. There were many clever and funny parts, but, as I've said a few times already, it did drag on at times. I was reminded a bit while watching this of Enchanted, mostly just because Enchanted was another Disney live action adaptation of fairy tales, and I couldn't help but think that Enchanted pulled it off better. That movie was a bit brighter, more fast-paced, had catchier songs, and I didn't want it to end. Into the Woods was good, but not great. I really enjoyed nearly every actor/actress's performance in this movie, and was really impressed by the singing. A fun movie, but may be better as a rental.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DDLISAOWRVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7WBGHG#wasThisHelpful","R19DDLISAOWRVW","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never read David Shapiro's blog, I rarely read Pitchfork Reviews, and I'm not a huge Belle and Sebastian fan. Had I been, I think I would have rated this book higher. As it was, however, I enjoyed it. It was a pretty fast read, and was humorous at times. I couldn't tell if David has Aspergers, as other people guessed he had, or if he was just playing that up for humor, but I enjoyed his writing style.The name of this book comes from a Belle and Sebastian song, which seems to be David's favorite band. David Shapiro is the pen-name for an unknown blogger in New York that became popular when he started a Tumblr writing reviews about the music reviews put out by Pitchfork Reviews. This book is semi-autobiographical, but I would imagine it's similar to David's blog (which, again, I haven't read, so I probably don't have the right to guess that, but I'm guessing that anyway).. At any rate, I would guess that this book is similar to his blog in the way that I'm sure you're not quite sure what's real or made up for his blog, since no one even knows David's real name. It could be 99% real, or it could be mostly an act and primarily made up. Either way, an interesting read. The book felt more like a memoir, despite the fact that the author says it's fiction and only semi-autobiographical, and tells the story of how a guy named David decides to start writing a blog, and how the blog becomes more popular. He has just graduated college and is still figuring out what he wants to do, so we follow him for about a year while he starts a blog, builds up his fan base, deals with a boring, menial job, and hangs out with friends and girlfriends. The book was funny, although not much seemed to happen. I liked the style and somewhat stream-of-consciousness-like voice that David writes in.This was an amusing read that went by pretty fast. I found it humorous at times, and liked to read it in little bits here and there, because it had a blog-like vibe.

"If you're reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books in publication order (or even essentially in chronological order, at this point), the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is the 4th book in the series. This is the 2nd short story/mystery collection, after The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  I tend to like the short story collections better than the full novel-length mysteries, and this collection didn't disappoint. Although I really liked Adventures, I think I preferred this book, because it was a bit more exciting and memorable.In Memoirs, we are introduced to many important characters in the Sherlock Holmes canon, including Sherlock's brother Mycroft. This collection also marks our first introduction of Sherlock's nemesis, Moriarty. The last story in this collection is The Last Problem, where we first see Sherlock and Moriarty go head to head (the results of this meeting leading to what is sometimes referred to as ""The Great Hiatus"" for Sherlock).This collection was entertaining and, in my opinions, still stands up pretty well more than 100 years later. The mysteries are engaging and seemingly unsolvable, until Sherlock cracks the case, with explanations making it seem so simple. For those unfamiliar with Sherlock, you can easily pick up this collection and jump right in, although you won't have as much background on Watson and Holmes relationship, or Holmes' quirks. Overall, an entertaining and fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSF3LFKAS1RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L01GHAA#wasThisHelpful","R3FSF3LFKAS1RZ","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maddy is a script supervisor on a popular primetime TV show. She has just started dating Craig, an executive at the production company she works for. Things start to get a little more complicated for Maddy with Adam, an actor on her show, persistently asking her out, and while she tries her hand at developing a reality show with Craig about Wolf County, Maddy's hometown.This book was a cute and easy read, like many in the contemporary or chick-lit genre. It gave a nice look at what happens behind the scenes in Hollywood, which I'm sure Alison Sweeney drew from her own experiences. This book reminded me a bit of Someday, Someday, Maybe by Lauren Graham, and also like some Sophie Kinsella books. I was pleasantly surprised by this book, because I'm always a bit skeptical when an actor or actress tries to break into writing, but I found this book entertaining and fun and look forward to reading more fiction from Alison Sweeney (including The Star Attraction, which features some of the same characters we see in this book).There were little inconsistencies or errors with the timeline here and there throughout the book that frustrated me, and I think it could be fixed by a better editing job. Some of them were errors with the timeline, that would jar me out of the story. For instance, at one point she said she was meeting Craig for dinner on Wednesday, and leaving Friday to visit her home town. But then on Friday when she's driving to her hometown, she remembers something that happened the night before when she and Craig were eating dinner.  At another point during the book, Maddy's father makes burgers for supper, but then the next morning she remembers how Craig cut his chicken the night before with a knife. When I'm reading a book and it's hard to follow the timeline, it really bothers me and makes it hard for me to focus and enjoy the book, so I wish little instances like those had been cleaned up a little.Despite the few problems I had with the timeline errors, I really enjoyed this book. It was a cute rom-com type of book, and I thought the glimpses into Maddy's job working on a TV show were really interesting.  I loved Adam's interest in Maddy, and enjoyed Maddy and Billy's friendship.  This book was cheesy and predictable at times (there was one scene in particular toward the end of the book in a bar where I could smell what was coming from a mile away), but the book was fun and feel-good. For me, I'd rate this 3 1/2 to 4 stars. It was entertaining and fed that guilty pleasure fix I get from learning behind the scenes things about the TV industry, but was also a cute, fun story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315MC3LT4SY3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR5N9LE#wasThisHelpful","R315MC3LT4SY3P","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I went into The Gambler, I stupidly wasn't aware it was a remake. I am a huge Mark Wahlberg fan, and that's all I needed to know before seeing the movie. The movie was good, but not great. Had it not starred Marky Mark, I'm not sure if I would have been as entertained. I obviously haven't seen the original, but now am looking forward to it (especially after hearing from others that it is much better than this version). Either way, this movie was good, but not great.Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a college English professor from a well-to-do family. He has a gambling problem, to the point where he's constantly hitting his mom (Jessica Lange) up for money to pay off his debts. He spends a HUGE amount at these underground clubs, where Amy, one of his students (Brie Larson), also happens to work. One night, he loses a ton of money and Mister Lee (Alvin Ing), the club owner, demands he pay off his balance within a week. Neville Baraka (Michael Kenneth Williams), a dangerous loan shark, swoops in and offers Bennett a line of credit. After using some of that money to pay off part of his debt to Mister Lee, Bennett blows the rest in minutes at the Blackjack table, now leaving him indebted to both Mister Lee and Baraka for a total of $260,000.Bennett approaches Frank (John Goodman), another loan shark, to see about consolidating his debts.  When Frank demands Bennett admit he's not a man before he'll loan him the money, Bennett leaves and eventually guilts his mom into giving him the money. Bennett proves he really isn't a man when he then blows through the money his mom loaned him at a casino, rather than use it to pay his debts.This movie was really frustrating at times. I realize gambling addictions are tough, but Wahlberg's character was just SO frustrating. I realize that it was probably intended for viewers to feel this way, but I started to become just really annoyed at Bennett. He acts suicidal and like he's not afraid of death, but he just brings everybody down with him and involves them all in his problems. Besides dragging Amy and his mom into his mess, he also involves Lamar Allen (Anthony Kelley) and Dexter (Emory Cohen), other students, in his problems.  Despite my annoyances, I was on the edge of my seat during some of the gambling scenes, holding my breath as if I had money invested in the outcome.Overall, a decent movie, but not my favorite Mark Wahlberg movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7VN68CFIK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8MTKDG#wasThisHelpful","R3O7VN68CFIK2","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1982 film version of Annie (with Aileen Quinn, Carol Burnett, and Tim Curry)  is one of my favorite movies ever, so when I heard they were remaking it, I was a little apprehensive. I went into this remake not expecting much out of it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't surpass the original, in my opinion, but it was a cute adaptation that I enjoyed, and my nieces (who haven't seen the original) ADORED it.Luckily this movie doesn't try to replicate the original, because there's no holding a candle to Tim Curry and Carol Burnett. This movie takes the same basic story, but modernizes it and makes it its own, which I actually enjoyed. Granted, the movie is cheesy, and there are quite a few big differences, but overall I thought this movie stayed true to the heart of Annie.This movie centers around Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) and Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Will Stacks is the ""Daddy Warbucks"" of this movie, with an updated name and backstory. In this movie, Stacks is a cell phone mogul who is running for mayor, but isn't doing so hot on the PR front because he's not relatable or down-to-earth. Annie and 4 other girls live in a foster home with Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), who is basically only taking care of them for the money. Annie is a lot more street-savvy and sassy in this movie, and it was a cute spin. Stacks ends up taking her in for awhile after he saves her from almost being hit by a van and his polls skyrocket. She plays up to her advantage the fact that he's using her to better his image, but of course, along the way she and Stacks grow to care for each other. Rose Byrne plays Grace, Stack's assistant, with Bobby Cannavale playing Stack's campaign manager, and David Zayas (Batista, for all you Dexter fans) plays Lou, a local store owner that's always been nice to Annie, yet inexplicably has the hots for Miss Hannigan.This movie contained a mixture of the classic songs everyone will remember from the stage version and 1982 movie, along with some original songs just for this remake. The biggest difference for me was that I found this movie to be more about the adults than the kids. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and thought it was cute. I enjoyed the fact that the plot was modernized, especially because I think there's no recreating the original. However, I wish we had seen more of Annie and her foster sisters. They had some sweet moments, but not as many as I would've enjoyed. Regardless, a cute, family-friendly movie with a good soundtrack full of some of my old favorites and some new tunes. 3 1/2 to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WJ40PJ079J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R878NI4#wasThisHelpful","R5WJ40PJ079J4","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Girl With a Clock For A Heart was a good book, but not great. This thriller/mystery follows George Foss, whose world is upset by a girl named Liana. When George first meets Liana in college, they date throughout their first semester before going to their separate hometowns for Christmas break. Liana never returns to school, having committed suicide over break. The book jumps back and forth between George's freshman year of college and present day, which is almost 20 years later, and we discover through flashbacks that the girl who committed suicide wasn't the girl that George was dating. In the college timeline, George is trying to figure out who his girlfriend really is and who committed suicide. In present-day, Liana shows back up needing a favor from George, and is an even bigger mystery than she was when he last saw her.While this book kept me reading, it wasn't too thrilling. The flashbacks made it seem like bits of the mystery were unfolding, but the frustrating part was that many of the events or mysteries weren't actually mysteries or bombshells.. They were events that were known to George, but that the reader wasn't let in on until the flashback explained things. I felt like the book was trying to be more thrilling or surprising than it actually was. It was an enjoyable-enough read, and kept me interested enough to stick it through to the end, but I didn't think the ending or mystery really made much sense, and had the story been told in a more straightforward manner from beginning to end, there wouldn't have really been much of a mystery. Not the most exciting, but not the most boring book. A decent read but that's about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57DDYEUQYWD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB39ZZE#wasThisHelpful","R57DDYEUQYWD3","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is primarily about mothers, and the fact that working isn't compatible with having children. Stay-at-home moms are looked down upon and treated as if they don't really work, so these mothers do more and more and more to assuage feeling guilty, and then mothers who also work outside of the home are looked down upon as bad mothers, so THEY do more and more and more to combat THEIR guilt. It's just an endless cycle where mothers are feeling what the author dubs ""the overwhelm"". While this book also discusses fathers, a majority of the book focused on all of the stresses that women face trying to ""have it all.""This book contained a lot of good research and interesting information, including facts about how women are thought to be the natural carers and men the natural workers. Unfortunately, it did drag at times and it was hard at times for me to fit in the time to make myself read it, which was ironic given the topic of the book.  I also thought the name of the book and the description I read about it was a bit misleading, as this book focused on the overwhelm that mothers have, rather than just the overwhelm that Americans in general face today, as I initially thought. Overall, an interesting read, but a bit wordy and repetitive at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZOK02L8QDUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EX0XYU6#wasThisHelpful","R3HZOK02L8QDUV","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start this review by saying that I haven't read Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer. Had I read that, I think I would have enjoyed this novella more, or found it more interesting and informative. Basically, Cornwell, the well-known author of the Kay Scarpetta mystery novels, wrote a book in 2002 about Jack the Ripper, and detailed what she thought was the true identity of the infamous serial killer. This Kindle single seems to assume the reader has already read that book, and starts by detailing how Cornwell became interested in Jack the Ripper. Then, the single shares a few brief details about how Cornwell is updating that 2002 book, before arguing some criticisms of that book and of Cornwell's belief of Jack the Ripper's identity.I wouldn't recommend reading this unless you've already read A Portrait of a Killer. This single may be a good companion read after finishing that book, if you found the book interesting.  To someone who has not read that book, I don't think this novella is worth the time or money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U2NTU06E86UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKOPENE#wasThisHelpful","R2U2NTU06E86UP","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years I've seen a lot of Jon Favreau movies, and I've learned that he can play a good jerk and he makes one helluva blockbuster. With this movie, he plays a bit of a jerk, but it's refreshing to see Favreau make a movie that's not just another hugely expensive blockbuster. While this movie first intrigued me because I'm a bit of a foodie, I ended up really enjoying the story. On the surface, this movie is about Favreau starting over when he is fired from his job in a fancy restaurant, by starting up a food truck. At its heart, however, this movie is about a father (Favreau) reconnecting with his 10-year-old son (Emjay Anthony). He starts off as a bit of a jerk, but he softens and becomes more likable over the course of the movie.Throughout Chef, we see a lot of familiar faces, including Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson (who Favreau directed and costarred alongside in Iron Man 2), John Leguizamo, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris, and Bobby Cannavale. Despite all of these great actors, Favreau and Anthony are the main stars of the movie, and some of these big names are hardly seen throughout the movie.I found the movie to be enjoyable, but the plot was pretty predictable. The scenes with food were great, and I wouldn't recommend watching this movie on an empty stomach. The food and colors were all so visually appealing and appetizing, and everything, both in the fancy schmancy restaurant AND in the food truck, looked beyond delicious.  To me it seemed like the food took the forefront in this film, and the plot was secondary. However, I still enjoyed the movie, and can see why this was a pet project of Favreau. Worth a watch, and make a reservation at a top notch restaurant for before or after you watch the movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQFM39JVFQDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQTGWPC#wasThisHelpful","R1AQFM39JVFQDA","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a teen I loved Lois Duncan's books, and probably read every single fiction book she wrote. When I recently stumbled across Ransom in the Amazon Kindle Store, I bought it to read (or re-read, as I couldn't remember if I'd ever read the book) for nostalgia's sake.Like many of Duncan's young adult books, this one is a thriller. Five high schoolers are taken hostage and held for ransom when riding home from school one day. At first they don't suspect anything is wrong when their normal bus driver is out and a substitute is in his place. After all of the kids besides the 5 that live in the ""rich"" neighborhood are dropped off, the 5 remaining kids are taken to a remote cabin, where they are held at gunpoint until their parents pay their kidnappers.Reading this as an adult, I found the book enjoyable, but not too thrilling. If I were younger, I probably would have found it more exciting. The ending is a bit abrupt, and there isn't much closure on what happens to the kids after the events of this book. However, I still enjoyed the book and thought Duncan kept events from dragging on by keeping the book moving along.One thing I thought was odd was that it seemed this book had clearly been edited to try to make it seem more current. This book was originally written in the 60s, but there were a few random references to cell phones in the Kindle version I read. The random references seemed to make it quite obvious that they were being added way after the fact to try to make the book seem newer, and I would have preferred to have just read the original book without these references, even if they had dated the book. For instance, when the kids are kidnapped, the kidnappers make a demand that everyone throw their cell phones on the floor. Then at another point, there is a single sentence about how there isn't any cell service up in the mountains where the cabin is at. In total there were probably only 3 or 4 sentences thrown in throughout the book to address or explain away why these teens couldn't have just whipped out cell phones to call for help, but I thought it took away from the book. I think teens today could have read the original version of the book and understood that this was written in the 60s, which is why cell phones aren't mentioned. My guess is publishers were afraid an older book wouldn't appeal to kids today without these minor edits, but I think I would have preferred a simple sentence about the year the book was set in to these stupid after-the-fact sentences that were added in, if they demanded something be added.At any rate, this was a good book. For the most part, if you look past the stupid updates about cell phones, the book still holds up more than 50 years after it was written.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZRL5WCNR1BC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008L8GI5O#wasThisHelpful","RZRL5WCNR1BC2","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this book was more than 600 pages, it didn't feel like it. It tells the mystery of what happened to Nola Kellergan, a 15-year-old that disappeared from the small town of Somerset, New Hampshire 33 years ago. The narrator of the story is Marcus Goldman, an author who recently wrote his first book, that was received very well. Marcus is dragged into the Nola cold case when Nola's body is found buried on his mentor (Harry Quebert)'s front lawn. Marcus starts investigating Nola's murder, and eventually sets out to write a book about what happened in attempts to clear Harry's name.The plot was full of twists and turns, and definitely gave us a lot of red herrings. The book started out slow for me, but about 200 pages in, the pace picked up and then I couldn't read it fast enough. I flew through the remaining 400 pages, and, although I had some guesses that ended up being correct, I was still continually surprised. The book jumps back and forth between present day, as we follow Marcus through his investigation and the current turn of events, and 33 years previously, as he discovers bits and pieces of the mystery and recounts the timeline leading up to Nola's death.This book contained so many plot twists and red herrings that I started looking at how many pages were left, and deciding that whatever I was finding out right now wasn't going to amount to much because there was too much time left to continue to shake everything up. However, I still really enjoyed the book. I became throughly invested in the story and the characters, and needed to know what happened to Nola, along with what the truth was behind other mysteries that popped up along the way. Overall, a really absorbing and entertaining read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNO70UUJOD4TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H87RLJQ#wasThisHelpful","RNO70UUJOD4TO","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Big Hero 6 is a cute, family-friendly movie that had my 6-year-old nephew cracking up throughout the entire movie, and me laughing along in most spots as well.The movie is based on a Marvel comic that I hadn't heard of until after I saw the movie. I thought the movie seemed to have a comic sort of vibe, and once I spotted a Stan Lee cameo, my thoughts were confirmed. Upon leaving the movie and looking up more info, I learned that the movie took a lot of liberty with these characters and this part of the Marvel Universe. However, the movie does set it up to possibly do more movies with these characters, and I like the idea of a Disney Animation Studios superhero series that is aimed at kids.I've gotten off-topic, but the movie centers around Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, who live with their aunt. Tadashi goes to a robotics college, while Hiro is a 14-year-old genius that graduated high school at 13 and hasn't decided what to do yet. He loves making robots and entering underground bot battles, until Tadashi brings him to his school to meet some of his friends and see what kind of robotics they're developing at college, prompting Hiro to invent an impressive microbot in efforts to get into this school.If you've seen any trailers you probably already know that Hiro's brother is going to die, but the movie takes the time to develop and establish Hiro and Tadashi's relationship first. Despite this, the death scene is treated in a way that isn't too in-your-face and emotional, which I appreciated because it didn't seem to faze or upset too many kids in the audience. It also meant that I wouldn't be crying like a baby like I did at the beginning of Up!, although I think that resulted in me not feeling quite as emotionally invested or connected to the characters in this movie.After Tadashi dies, Hiro eventually teams up with Baymax, a healthcare robot developed by Tadashi that resembles the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man a bit, and Tadashi's friends to find the villain who killed Tadashi and stole Hiro's microbots.This movie was funny throughout, and had some pretty neat gadgets and inventions. I thought this movie was a good movie for children because it addressed death and loss without being too emotional, and also showed how great it is to use all of your skills and not be afraid to be smart or creative. It had some good messages and surprisingly seemed to make kids actually think through the use of some plot twists that, while probably pretty obvious to adults, seemed to trick all of the kids in the audience in a thought-provoking way. (At my theater, I heard shocks of awe and exclamations of surprise from many children throughout the theater, and many kids nearby were guessing out loud whodunnit or how the mystery would play out.)As is to be expected from Disney Animation movies of late, the visuals were really fun to look at. The setting was especially fun, as it took place in San Fransokyo, a hybrid Tokyo/San Francisco city. The city landscapes were beautiful, as you could recognize some of the most distinct parts of San Francisco, with some definite Japanese influences.Overall, this was a cute family film. It wasn't too short or too long, and it seemed to keep most adults and children entertained. There were some really funny parts, and some good messages. I really liked all of the characters, but didn't feel as much of a connection to them as I do to some Disney or Pixar movies, and this one didn't tug on my heartstrings as much as others, so I can't give it a 5, but I would rate it 3 1/2 to 4 stars.As an aside, there was an adorable short at the beginning of this movie called Feast, that is definitely worth a watch, if anyone has an opportunity to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0QOTJE2NHR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4ZC57I#wasThisHelpful","R2D0QOTJE2NHR6","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zoe and Greg are an overweight couple who join a radio show weight-loss competition in hopes of getting back down to their college-years' weight and in winning the 50,000 pound (this book is set in the UK) prize. The story is told in the form of diary entries from Zoe and Greg, with each alternating chapters.I didn't care for this book, but from reading other reviews it appears I could be alone in that. While it was a light story and a pretty easy read, I found the characters and parts of the book way too far-fetched and ridiculous to enjoy, the characters mostly unlikable, the story boring, and the diary tool way overplayed. Overall it just wasn't that amusing or entertaining.First, the whole diary-writing aspect didn't make sense. We're supposed to be reading diary entries that Zoe and Greg have to write for the radio station's blog as part of the weight-loss contest. While they mention a few times that the radio show said they would edit the entries down, Zoe and Greg seem to treat the diaries as personal diaries, not entries that will be read by at least the producers of the radio show, if not thousands or more fans as the entries are edited and posted online. The couple both talk about extremely embarrassing or really personal things that they don't want people to know...yet they're writing about it for the blog.. Hello??! Do you really think they're going to edit all of that out?! Zoe and Greg would basically talk about how they were being exploited for ratings, but then they would share this info in the diary as if it wasn't being given to the people they were complaining about. There was even one really embarrassing story that Zoe is upset she has to share on the radio, so she doesn't share the full, super embarrassing story. But then she recounts that whole story for the diary that is going to be given to the producers of the radio show she is mad at for exploiting her for ratings.I found Zoe especially to be unlikable, and part of it may have been because I didn't find her voice too believable as a female. The male author of this book came through in Zoe, as her entries painfully reminded me that they were actually written by a man. I also thought Zoe was pretty rude, and she said/wrote a lot of really mean things about other people. She seemed to hate on everyone, especially people who were just trying to be nice and encourage or cheer them on. She was friends with Elise, one of the lead DJs, but had to keep it under wraps during the contest (and of course she spills this detail numerous times in the diary, along with various personal secrets of Elise's).  There is some friction in the book between Elise and Zoe as Elise will put Zoe on the spot during radio interviews if an interview with another contestant is going south, or Elise will lead Zoe in a direction Zoe doesn't want the conversation to go to. Zoe is understandably upset, but rather than just keep her mouth shut and decline to comment or discuss things she doesn't want to talk about on the radio, Zoe will talk about it and then complain afterward in the diary about how it's Elise's fault. I hate people who try to blame other people for things that they were in full control of. If Zoe didn't want to talk about something, she didn't have to. But instead she talks and then is extremely rude and mean to Elise, including purposefully sharing information about Elise on the radio or in the diary, and saying inappropriate things on-air that will get Elise in trouble or the radio show fined.While this weight-lost contest seemed like it was supposed to be like The Biggest Loser but on radio, it wasn't at all believable. The main issue for me was that there weren't any doctors overseeing this extreme weight loss challenge to ensure the contestants' safety. No one was helping contestants come up with an exercise or diet plan, and there seemed to be no one monitoring things to ensure contestants were exercising, dieting, and losing weight in a healthy way that would prevent injury or real harm. Seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen, and in the real world, there would be people on staff to oversee all of that.Another really frustrating thing was the timeline in the book, as it didn't make sense and was full of inconsistencies. They started in March and ended at the end of August. In one diary entry Zoe says they're a week away from their first weigh-in, but then the date of the diary entry detailing their first weigh-in is 2 weeks later. When they finally do have the first weigh-in, it isn't until sometime in mid-April, but then it mentions there are 9 total weigh-ins... So they waited a month and a half for the first weigh-in, then they plan to squeeze 8 more weigh-ins in over the next 4 months..? But then they only have monthly weigh-ins... Basically, there are inconsistencies all around. It was so hard to follow and keep track of what was happening and when because the timeline kept changing.Then there were just some super far fetched scenes. Greg takes 3 ibuprofen, and then starts acting drunk.  That does not happen on ibuprofen and is just ridiculous. Then at another point, Greg blames blisters on some generic shoes, and not the fact that he went on a long-distance run in brand new shoes that weren't broken in at all.I don't mean to rag on the book, but it just really frustrated and annoyed me. However, if you look can past the unrealistic story and find the characters likable, and if the premise sounds entertaining, then it's not bad. I've read worse.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDAXFGNAMGBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMOUZCE#wasThisHelpful","R3CDAXFGNAMGBT","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really informative book that addresses the science behind whether or not fathers matter. Fathers are often downplayed in our society, and in this book, Raeburn presents many of the scientific studies out there that deal with this subject matter to try to determine what effect a father has on his child's life.The book is very scientific and a bit dry at times. It presents a lot of facts and research, which do run into each other and can become a bit repetitive. But it was very informative and interesting, with some parts being more interesting than others. Raeburn does a good job of breaking down the science so it's easy to understand, and of explaining what various studies involving mice tell us about fathers. The book explores a lot of topics, including how the absence of a father can affect a child, how an attentive father can influence his child sociability in later years, and how older or unhealthy fathers can impact the health of his child.Overall, a very informative read that I think would benefit men and women that have children or plan to have children, so they can better understand the role a father plays in his child's life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQ8KC1XAA7IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVQXZBI#wasThisHelpful","RJQ8KC1XAA7IO","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meh. This book was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read it. It's a British ""thriller"" about a dysfunctional marriage. Hannah is a Brit working in New York when she meets Mark, and they have a short, whirlwind courtship before marrying and moving back to London. Hannah discovers she doesn't really know all that much about her husband after he doesn't return as planned from a business trip, and she starts snooping around.This book was fine, but it had trouble keeping my interest. Although it was a thriller, I didn't find it too thrilling. It was boring and ho-hum, and there were many attempted plot twists that I could either see coming from a mile away, or that just weren't that exciting. The book was okay, but there are better thrillers out there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257MU6MMZ6Z1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GC53AEU#wasThisHelpful","R257MU6MMZ6Z1C","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see a LOT of movies, and I also read a LOT of books. When I saw a promotional poster for this movie at the movie theater the week before Halloween, I was surprised because, while I had heard they were making this book into a movie, I hadn't realized it would be coming out soon. I hadn't seen any trailers for this movie, in the theater or on tv, so all I knew about this movie going into it was that it was based on a book I could vaguely recall, and it was a thriller.I read this book several years ago, and can't remember much about it. I remember at the time thinking it was good but not great, and apparently I rated it 3 out of 5 stars on Goodreads. I remember the climax of the book, but that's about it. From what I can recall of the book (but don't quote me), Christine is an amnesiac that may be repressing her memories after a horrific accident years earlier. Every day when she wakes up, she doesn't remember anything and has to have her husband fill her in. She keeps a diary with notes to herself, including details of secret doctor's visits that her husband is unaware of, and a note is scribbled in there not to trust her husband.The movie follows the same basic premise. At the start of the movie, Christine (Nicole Kidman) wakes up in bed with a man's arm around her and seems alarmed. She goes to the bathroom to see pictures taped up of her and this man, with post-it notes saying things like, ""Ben, your husband"", and ""our wedding"". She comes out of the bathroom and Ben (Colin Firth) is waiting for her, and explains that she had an accident about 10 years ago and doesn't remember anything. After her husband leaves for work, a man calls Christine claiming to be her doctor, and tells her to look in the back of her closet for a hidden camera that she uses to record video messages she's taped for herself. Christine needs this because every day when she sleeps, her brain ""resets"" itself and she forgets all of the memories from that day, so she has to rely on whatever information Ben gives her. Basically, this movie is 50 First Dates as a thriller.Walking out of the movie, my husband commented that it was good, but not as good as Gone Girl (which I really enjoyed, although still had my own issues on that one as well). I would have to agree. For me, this movie was similar to the book in that it was unmemorable. It's similar to Gone Girl, but Gone Girl is better.  In a few weeks, I probably won't remember much about this movie, other than the fact that it was good, but not great. It was a suspenseful thriller that kept you wondering what was going on until the end, but it was a bit slow at parts. Also, there were major holes in the plot that I couldn't get past. Getting into them here would spoil the movie, and if you look past some of the more unbelievable aspects, the movie is still enjoyable. What you need to know is that Christine was severely beaten and left for dead, causing her amnesia. We don't know who to trust and who is telling the truth or lying, and both of the men we meet (Ben and Christine's doctor) seem suspicious, but Christine's old friend Claire also is a bit untrustworthy. While the book has Christine keeping a diary to track memories and notes, the movie uses the camera. I found the use of the camera and videos to be a bit more effective in movie-form than a diary, and I think it's smart they made this change in the movie, to try to differentiate itself a little more from Gone Girl.One thing about this movie that pleasantly surprised me was the acting. I normally love Colin Firth, but he really surprised me in this role because Ben was a little bit creepy and suspicious, and it was a totally different role than most of the roles I'm used to seeing Firth in. Nicole Kidman is an actress that typically grates on me. My husband loves her but I can't stand her, although I can't quite put my finger on why she bothers me so much. In this movie, I thought she did a good job and I really didn't mind her and actually enjoyed her performance. However, my favorite performance in the whole movie was that of Mark Strong, who played Christine's neurologist, Dr. Nasch. His character kept me guessing a few times as well, but I found him really intriguing, and liked every scene with him in it.Overall, this movie was fine. A decent thriller, but again, good, not great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0UC5VECCVBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q89MH6M#wasThisHelpful","R3C0UC5VECCVBK","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Horrible Bosses 2 does what so few comedy sequels are able to do, and that is to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor. While I don't think it surpassed the original (which I thought was hilarious), I thought it did a great job and I give it an A for effort.This movie follows a similar formula to the first one, but changes it up enough to avoid feeling too recycled. In the first Horrible Bosses, Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day) hate their bosses and plot to kill them. In this one, Nick, Kurt, and Dale are trying to go into business for themselves selling a product they've invented called the Shower Buddy (which seemingly dispenses soap for you out of the shower head). They manage to get a huge retailer owned by Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) and his son Rex (Chris Pine) to order 100,000 units and they think they're on their way to making it rich, so they lease a warehouse and hire staff to fulfill the order. Unfortunately, Bert and Rex were just screwing the guys over, probably because these lovable idiots are easy targets. Apparently Nick and the others didn't think to get a deposit from Bert or sign a contract, so after they've made all of the units, Bert cancels the order and plans on swooping in and buying the patent and inventory after the guys go bankrupt. So..the gang decides to kidnap Rex and hold him for ransom, and obviously hijinks ensue.Back for the ride this time are MF-er Jones (Jamie Foxx) and Mr. Harken (Kevin Spacey), who both dish out advice to our dumb pals. Jennifer Aniston reprises her role as Julia, Dale's crazy old boss, and we also see Lindsay Sloane a few times (very few times, unfortunately IMO) as Dale's wife.I thought this movie was pretty funny. I laughed consistently throughout the movie, and it didn't have the third act slump that many comedies suffer from. Plus, this movie has one of my favorite things - a gag reel that plays during the closing credits.  (You just can't top a funny gag reel. Right when you think the movie is over and you start the slow shuffle down the stairs and out the door, the gag reel starts, making you walk out the door on a high note thinking about the funny line this person ad-libbed or the funny goof that person made.. Smart move..) All of the actors were great and funny in this movie (Day, Sudeikis, Spacey, Foxx, Bateman, Waltz) but Aniston was my favorite. I felt this movie stood on its own pretty well, and you could easily see this one without having seen the first movie. (Although I don't recommend it - Horrible Bosses is great!) If you liked the first movie, I don't think this one will disappoint. It was full of laughs and I'd rate it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNPTW881QNO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4F95TM#wasThisHelpful","R1BNPTW881QNO4","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As most people probably already know, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I is the third movie in the Hunger Games series. Like with Harry Potter and Twilight, producers decided they could churn out some more money by splitting the last book into two movies, so this movie adapts the events from the first half of Mockingjay, the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.Mockingjay Part I picks up right where Catching Fire left off, so if you haven't seen the first two movies, I would wait to see this movie.  Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Finnick (Sam Claflin), and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) have been rescued from the Quarter Quell by rebels, and they're taken to a huge underground facility in District 13. Katniss' mom (Paula Malcomson) and sister (Willow Shields) are there, along with tons of other rebels. Katniss meets President Coin (Julianne Moore), the rebel leader, who wants Katniss to be their mockingjay and be the face of the rebellion so they can take down the Capitol. Katniss is furious because they didn't rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and initially refuses. Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman) suggests Katniss be taken above ground to District 12, and after Katniss sees her former district in ruins, she changes her mind and agrees to help, under the condition that Coin will rescue the remaining victors that were taken by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) as soon as possible and pardon each of them. With the help of Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Effie (Elizabeth Snow), Gale, and some new friends/allies, Katniss basically goes to visit other districts and see the aftermath of various battles while filming propaganda commercials.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Although it was just over 2 hours, the movie kept things moving and didn't have many slow parts. There was always SOMETHING happening. Even though I read the trilogy quite some time ago, I felt that this movie stayed pretty true to the Mockingjay book, while somehow improving upon it.  I don't say this often, but this movie was better than the book.  I really enjoyed the first two books (and movies), but I found the Mockingjay book to be a bit disappointing. This movie, however, greatly improved upon the book. The only thing close to disappointment was the feeling I felt after seeing this movie, when I realized I would now have to wait an entire year before I could see the conclusion in Part 2.This movie had a different feel to it than the first movie, and I think part of it has to do with the fact that there are no Hunger Games in this movie. While the first two movies seemed to have plenty of time to showcase just Katniss, or Katniss with her sister or Gale or Peeta, I felt this movie had a bit too many people around. I really liked the movie, but with all the characters interacting with Katniss, there wasn't much time for her to have touching moments with Prim and the others.  I didn't get to see enough Peeta, Gale, or Haymitch, and I kind of missed them. While Gale was in a lot of scenes, he didn't seem to do much or have much speaking lines for the first half of the movie, and pretty much the only time we got to see Peeta was on tv when he was being interviewed by Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci).  Also, this movie definitely lacked much romance and played down the love triangle of Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. Despite my complaints here, this movie was elaborate and exciting and fun.  I really enjoyed this one and can't wait to see the final movie....next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0PBVQKI5WCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYLT0OW#wasThisHelpful","R3A0PBVQKI5WCN","A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AJBYGO0ED6PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own a weber performer charcoal grill. I have replaced the stainless steel grill grate with a Craycort Seasoned Cast Iron Grate. That being said I've had a hard time finding a brush that can do it all. The cast iron grate is much thicker than the stainless steel wires. When I bought the grill I bought the Charcoal Companion Monster Big Head Grill Brush. It did a great job getting down inside the grill grate but always left residue on the top. So I bought the Grill Wizard Brush and that did an amazing job on the top but couldn't get in between the grate very well. I bought the chain mail for my cast iron pans which does great but terrible for the hot grill.I just received this brush in the mail today and it looked very promising. A nice long handle but no longer than the others I had but those were sufficiently long to keep the heat away from my hands. The long bristles were very compact and stiff. Much tougher and more compact than my Charcoal Companion one. The Charcoal Companion heads were more expensive to replace but lasted longer than the Grill Wizard one. But this one has a lifetime warranty with free replacement. .. nothing is better than that.This cleaned my grill grate very well. Got in between the grates and cleaned the top. It's angle was good so you can apply a good amount of force of you need to. The handle is nice and thick and sturdy. The only downside was that because it was so stiff it was really difficult to clean against the direction of the grill grate. Small price to pay.That being said I'd willingly pay more to have this made in the USA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTO3FAYWRKFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIR549E#wasThisHelpful","R1YTO3FAYWRKFA","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The helper handle on this was the selling point for me on this one. When making a sauce and dumping it into a container it is extremely nice to have the helper handle to control the pour easier. The copper core really really shines on the induction burner. It reacts really quickly to the changes in power on induction. It takes about 3 seconds to see the change. I love it. Great feel and the angle of the handle are just right. The copper band is not hard to clean.

"I teach a culinary class at a private high school. I have told all my students that when buying a turner/spatula to start with a fish spatula. A good fish spatula will essentially be the only turner you'll need. So the very first turner I bought was the Wusthof Gourmet Slotted Turner. I love that turner. It is my favorite turner and its the best one I've ever used. That being said it comes at a fairly steep price for a turner at $45 dollars. When I determined I needed a second spatula I decided to see if I could find a comparable turner made in the USA.This spatula is made in Massachusetts, not too far from me. That's a huge plus for me because I like to support the local economy and American jobs.I gave this four stars because its almost as great as the Wusthof one.1. The rivets on this one do not hold the handle as tightly together as the one on the Wusthof handle. I like the feel of wood in my hand but the looseness of the handle I dont appreciate. Its bad enough to notice but not so bad I can't use it. Overall this is the worse thing about the product.2. This one is about half as thick as as the Wusthof one. That is really great for trying to flip things like fish and eggs. The downside to how thick this is, is that it makes it a bit more flexible. So heavier things like large pancakes do provide a bit more of a challenge to keep the heavier items on the spatula without sliding off. Overall I prefer the slightly thicker Wusthof version, it tends to be more versatile.3. Slots on this one are thicker than the one on the Wusthof version. To me that is a great plus. It adds to the sturdiness in desperately needs but also prevents smaller food from falling through. Overall I do prefer the ticker tines on this one than the Wusthof one.4. The offset angle at the front end of the spatula on this one is not as dramatic as the Wusthof one. At first I wasn't sure which I preffered. Because prefer the Wusthof one overall I thought I might prefer its sharper angle. However, over time I have found that its steeper angle when up against the sides of a saute pan do require more dexterity. That being said I do prefer the less dramatic angle of the LamsonSharp.Overall I don't think I could completely replace my Wusthof one with this one but if they could tighten up the handle and stiffen up the turner a bit more, this would be a no brainer. The fact that it's made in the USA is huge perk for me. So all things considered, I would definitely buy this again and I do recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPGBIXTKGZB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GSP1Y#wasThisHelpful","RNPGBIXTKGZB4","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even the pictures of the product are spot on (which is rare for most products).My negatives are that orange guard/plunger in the back of the product have little spikes to grip the vegetables and help you use as much as possible. I found the spikes were too small and have a tendency to tear through the vegetable, even the tough ones like carrots. If the spikes were longer and thinner I think that would be an improvement.

"No spoiler alerts in this review. This is my first time writing a review for a movie as far as I can remember. I really find reviewing movies to be completely subjective. Movies are like food and art in my opinion. Everyone has a taste and flavor something different. I felt compelled to write a review for this movie because, well in my opinion, it well exceeded my expectations for what this movie would deliver.The first captain america movie was OK at best. It was more of a Monologue that began to build his character. The fight scenes/ action scenes kinda felt flat very one note. By contrast, the winter soldier tied in that first movie and gave it the depth it needed to make this a great film.I have felt that Disney had really underpowered Captain America as a superhero. In this movie I feel like that gave him a significant boost in power that made him a more formidable superhero. The fight scenes were incredible in my opinion. Kudos to whoever was doing the stunts because they were incredible. It isnt unusual for the editor to speed up the fight scenes to make them more dramatic and if they did that in this movie it was nearly as noticeable as I had seen in other movies.Captain America really steps up his game in this movie and you really see his leadership abilities as well. The dialogue between characters is well developed as well as the banter.The villains were well developed as well.The post credit scenes (yes there are two) are worth sitting around for and waiting. They give a nice prelude of what's to come. I want to write more but for the sake of not giving away any part of the movie I will refrain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NNVRMJYN8D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SI3EI#wasThisHelpful","R10NNVRMJYN8D4","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasnt sure about this product because of the reviews on it but after having used it and tested it multiple times I like it. I know it says its only accurate up to just over 9 feet but I tested this in my room wall to wall and it said 17ft 2.6in. I took my tape measure out and it was 17ft 2.5inches. I was surprised that it was that accurate. It has been nearly accurate in every situation ive needed it in. I even have a slanted ceiling in two bedrooms.and I needed to know what the height was from the floor to intersection of the ceiling to the floor. It even measured that accurately.

"I have the 4 of Oxa Portable power batteries. This review will compare the four among themselves and my use of them.OXA Juice Box S2Oxa Aluminum Alloy UltraThinOxa PerfumeOxa 2200mAh portable power.The Oxa Juice Box S2 is definitely my favorite of the four that I own. If i was only going to buy one portable power this would be the one I would want. It is capable of charging two devices at one time. But I do warn you that amount of power drains this battery really fast. I actually used it two charge my HTC smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It charged both but drained relatively fast. I like that this one has a digital display and tells you which output you are using (2.1 or 1.0) or what your charge % is at while charging or draining. The flashlight is relatively bright. All the products with flashlights are turned on by double clicking the power button in quick succession. There was no instructions for this procedure which did aggravate me. I actually had to come onto amazon and read a review in order to figure it out. So I thought Id add it to my review as well. It takes about 2.5 hours to charge completely from dead. I did notice that mine died at about 9% charge. The cable that comes with it is nice and sturdy and most of the connectors you would need for most smartphone and tablets (new and old apple connectors as well). Of all the portable power batteries this one is the bulkiest.The OXA ALUMINUM ALLOY ULTRATHIN is the 2nd bulkiest but is significantly thinner. I would also rate this as my 2nd favorite portable battery. Little blue LED indicators let you know how much charge you have in 25% increments. The LED flashlight turns on with a double click from the power button. The first one they sent me didnt work and the company immediately sent me another one without hassle so kudos to OXA for that. This one also has two charge ports (2.1 and 1.0). I used it the same way as in the previous review and it did discharge faster than the Juice Box. My biggest complaint for this one is that the cable that comes with this one was really touchy with my smartphone. I actually bought the Amazon Basics equivalent to replace the cable that came with this one. I actually prefer the Amazon Basics cables over these anyway. This one takes about 2hrs to charge completely from deadThe OXA 2200mAh my third favorite for its size and the fact that i can plug this directly into a usb charger without a cable. Amazon basics has a male to female cable that works with this too if you want a cable. This one does not come with any extra connectors so you wont be able to charge your apple products on it unfortunately. It only has a 1amp output so it works for my smartphone but my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 draws too much power from this to work effectively. My biggest suggestion for this product is the cover that goes over the USB side of it should be either tethered or hinged to the product to prevent it from getting lost. Overall good product though. This takes about an 1hr to charge from dead to complete.The OXA PERFUME is supposed to be a portable keychain battery backup. I find it way to bulky to carry on my keychain. That being said it is a great little charger. Also only has 1A output. It comes with all the connectors you need as well.  While testing this product the car charger in my car died and I needed my phones GPS to get me where I was going. This saved my butt from being late and managed to charge my phone even while my phone was using a high draw from the GPS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KRYQK8YYERD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3Z9NBM#wasThisHelpful","R12KRYQK8YYERD","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"And every time I see him use it, I think to myself I would love to have one of those! It was cool to find this product on amazon. I read a bunch of the reviews and knew before buying it not to grab it buy the neck since it might fall off.Over the past few months I have been able to use this quite successfully without ever grabbing it buy the neck. I use it all the time when I am heating a skillet with oil in it and only use a tablespoon or two (depending on my cooking method for that recipe).I have to say this has become one of my favorite tools in the kitchen for convenience. I wouldnt go so far as to say that this tool is a necessity to have in the kitchen because quite honestly it isnt. However, I do feel it definitely helps speed things along sometimes.

"So I bought this for the purpose of having this spout on the Extra Virgin Olive Oil that I have. Most olive oils come in a clear plastic bottle and is cheaper. I use that type of olive oil (not extra virgin) usually for cooking and the whole idea of protecting its flavor and nutrients arent an issue for me. I actually use the http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VLZIA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32 for that type of oil since I usually use a tablespoon or two for my skillets this is a perfect tool.But I digress. For my Extra Virgin Olive Oil the glass green coated bottles are perfect for storing my precious extra virgin olive oil. Since there are very few replacement bottles anyway that protect my bottle as well as the bottle they come in I thought this OXO Oil Stopper/Pourer would be my solution for a slower pour and also sealing the bottle.Well let me tell you I usually save the bottles my EVOO comes in and repurpose them for salad dressing. So in my storage I have 3 different bottles.Columela EVOO from Spain: This stopper pourer was too big for this bottleCalifornia Olive Ranch Millers Blend: This stopper pourer was too small for this bottle(I feel like I am telling the story of Goldie Locks lol)California Olive Ranch Arbequina: This stopper pourer was also too big for this bottle.Since the California Olive Ranch Arbequina bottles are the ones I buy most often I took a razor blade and trimmed the stopper/pourer down till in fit tightly into the bottle.Now that I have trimmed it and have had multiple chances to use it, I notice that sometimes in can pour painfully slow but if you give it a quick shake or shakes it usually will begin to pour out at a reasonable speed.I gave it four stars because it wasnt able to fit any of the three bottles I use and for its slow pour. It gets good marks for its ability to seal in the bottle and the fact that I was able to trim it to size. When it does pour out at good speed its perfect its just a little tricky to get it to do it every time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R172NXJX9ST8KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CDLL7U#wasThisHelpful","R172NXJX9ST8KV","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont use this for your typical oven roasting usage. I have been using this as my medium for sous vide cooking. I use this with my homemade thermocouple and a 5dollar aquarium pump. With the thermocouple, aquarium pump, and this oven roaster I have successfully made quite a few sous vide recipes.There are a few things I dont like with this product though. The black insert is a sheet metal product that may not be the best heat sink for this method but the water handles that ok. 2ndly any part of that black insert that missed painting will rust in the water. Also the accessory rack rusts along all of the weld spots. very annoying.One tip, if you use this for sous vide cooking its best to set your oven roaster to just about the 200degree mark. Under that and it takes forever to heat up and over that it tends to over shoot the temp while trying to regulate the temp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYT8DYFOCALI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V5GUZU#wasThisHelpful","REYT8DYFOCALI","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this ice cream tub. I love the long length of it. I use my kitchen-aid 6qt ice cream maker to make home-made ice cream.

"This is my first french press coffee carafe.The first thing I noticed was that the instructions for using the french press was on the box instead of an insert on paper inside. The box was thrown away immediately after opening and two days went by before I used it and forgot what the instructions said.2nd: This french press is advertised as 8 cups. I already know from previous experience that the coffee industry has redifined what a CUP is. For every application besides coffee a cup is 8 ounces. But for coffee it is 5 oz. I always do a 7:5 ration of coffee to water. Essentially I do 56grams of coffee (yes i weigh my coffee) to 40oz of water. Because of my preconceived notion that a cup of coffee would be 5 oz I went ahead and prepared my coffee for 56 grams assuming I was going to use 40oz of water. WRONG. This company has redefined the CUP as 4.25 ounces.That being said. This made an incredibly smooth coffee. I was really impressed with it. I will re-adjust the ratio i used initially because i did 56grams of coffee to 34oz of water and that was a bit of a waste of coffee beans knowing that now. So I only knocked it down for them calling it 8cups when its more like 4cups. I like this french press. I will definitely continue to use it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQAFHC95DJ0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUHACEE#wasThisHelpful","RRQAFHC95DJ0I","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I started buying EVOO I read a lot about the benefits and the scandals surrounding it. I read all about the imported extra virgins may not be extra virgin at all. I read about different home tests you could do. I read consumer reports and they reported that KIRKLAND EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil was the real deal and had great flavor.I started buying Kirkland Extra Virgin olive oil but it really bothered me to buy it in a PVC or PET bottle whether or not it was BPA Free.I decided I wanted to buy in glass bottles from now on and continued my search. America's Test Kitchen picked their favorite brand of EVOO as Columela from Spain. I really liked that olive oil and bought it for months. But something in me kept telling me that if I could buy American I should.I found the California Olive Ranch Miller's Choice brand and bought that for awhile but I honestly still preferred the Columela brand from Spain so I went back to it.Then I saw America's Test Kitchen did a test of California olive oils up against there favorite Spanish olive oil (Columela) and though none of their competitors beat their favorite in blind taste testings the California Olive Ranch Arbequina EVOO came in under a fraction of a point under the Columela brand. I decided to give this olive oil a try.I must say this is clearly my favorite EVOO I have tasted yet. Even my wife who is not a fan of EVOO at all noticed the fruitiness of this olive oil and I have successfully won her over.

"I get frustrated when I read reviews from people who have not done their homework.1. What is Classico pure olive oil? and How is it different from Extra Virgin Olive Oil?Before I begin let me start by saying I have contacted Bertolli to determine what is in this particular product. The ONLY (let me repeat) ONLY ingredient in this olive oil is.... olives! Federal law states that if the label does not represent exactly what is in the bottle then an ingredient list is required! Since only olives are present in this oil then no ingredient list is required. So what is Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil from bertolli? Its olive oil.How is it different from Extra Virgin Olive Oil? Now that is a great question. There are different degrees of freshness and purity based on their label. The different degrees in descending order from most fresh to least fresh are as follows:Extra Virgin Olive OilVirgin Olive OilClassic / Pure Olive OilExtra Light Tasting Olive OilOlive OilAs you can see this product is 3rd from the bottom in freshness. So why is that? and why would one who knows this want to buy it?How is Classic Olive Oil made? Extra Virgin Olive Oil is made by hand picking or machine picking olives at their peak ripeness then usually cold pressed and stored in a gas chamber and bottled on demand. That is the freshest way and keeps most of its flavors and nutrients.How is that different from Classic Olive Oil? Classic Olive Oil is usually made from the olives that have already fallen of the tree and began to rot. They have a terrible flavor. These olives are cooked at a low temperature in order to mute their flavor. By the way these olives are also cold pressed exactly the same way as the Extra VIrgin Olive oil. These olives after cooking are then strained and put in a gas chamber and then to just add a little of that flavor back they take some of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil and add just a small amount back to it. Now understand that this process does indeed remove some of the nutritional value of olive oil. Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil can also be called Refined Olive Oil. Did you know most of the oils you use are probably already refined with a similiar if not harsher process i.e. Canola Oil, Vegetable Oil, (most) Peanut oil? Refining oil is not something we are unfamiliar with, but we seem to hold a different expectation for olive oil.So why buy it?Well for one did you know that refining oil increases its smoke temperature and decreases its freeze temperature? What does that mean for you? EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) has a smoke temperature of about 350-375. Which means when the oil hits that temperature it starts to break down and lose nutrients at that temperature. That makes EVOO very difficult to cook with ( I dont recommend it). Classic Olive Oil from Bertolli has a smoke temperature of 460 and because it has a very neutral taste it means that you can fry (again i dont recommend) or BAKE (I DO RECOMMEND) with it. It has been refined so some of its nutrients are already lost. Have you ever tried to bake a cake with EVOO? Its gross. But i guarentee you have with Vegetable Oil or Canola Oil. You can bake with this oil as well. Well why bake with this instead of Vegetable oil or Canola oil? Well vegetable oil is made with a wide mix of different vegetables and put thru more of a chemical process in order to maintain that neutral flavor. Same thing is done with Canola Oil.Though this oil has lost some of its nutrients in refining it hasnt lost them all. And though i would not recommend this for a salad dressing I absolutely recommend this for cooking and baking applications (I recommend peanut oil for frying).Now when it comes to buying Classic Olive Oil your only prerequisite should be - is it in fact just OLIVE OIL or something more. I would not get into how fresh it is or anything else because it is irrelevant. Apply those standards to EVOO.As far as Classic Olive Oil is concerned I recommend Bertolli. Of the companies I emailed about their processes and ingrediants Bertolli were the most transparent and had a good turn around time. Also I learned that even in the Classic Olive Oil they maintained at 77% ratio of mono-unsaturated fats (thats the good fat you want to eat as opposed to saturated or trans-saturated fat) which is well within the average for GOOD olive oils.If you want a good EVOO i recommend Columela Extra Virgin Olive Oil From Spain or Arbequina Olive Oil from California Olive Ranch. They are also very transparent and take great care to keep their full of its nutrients and freshness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8OJKDOZVO3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DQUJMY#wasThisHelpful","R1L8OJKDOZVO3U","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to buy in bulk but i also like to store in containers as opposed to the plastic or paper bag the product comes in. I bought a 10-lb bag of sugar and none of my 4qt and under containers could hold the entire 10lbs. I went online to try to find a product that clearly told me that it would hold either 10lbs of flour or sugar and then I knew I would be set. Long story short i couldnt find one.I had the 8qt version of this container that i use to brine whole chickens. I took the container down dumped the 10lbs of sugar into and it came up to just beyond the 5.5 qt line.Problem solved I now knew I needed to by a container that was at least 6 qts.Stores the sugar great. The container is very sturdy. There is more than enough room to get my measuring cup in there for a full scoop and sweep. Stores nicely as well.I am very happy with this container.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UCIXKAIQSQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015R9VXO#wasThisHelpful","R19UCIXKAIQSQ4","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item is one in times past I would never have considered buying. In my day to day routines, I have a charger everywhere I go. While I sleep my phone is charging.When I wake up it goes onto my computer charging.Drive to work, on a charger.Get to work, theres a charger on my desk.Needless to say I never thought I'd have a need for a portable charger.In the past month or so I have found myself in situations that were not in my routine and put me in positions where I had no charger near by for hours at a time.I had this charger and started to use it. I have to say I loved it. I was able to sit in a restaurant waiting for a client and was able to surf the web and monitor my live streaming security cameras from my phone and this charger not only was able to hold the charge but actually increase the charge on my phone. BIG WIN in my book.My car charger in my car died and I was heading to a place with my GPS and this charger was able to make the difference of whether I got there painlessly or had to guess my way.Bottom line this is definitely a nice accessory to keep around. I keep it in my car so that its always with me. They have a key chain on it but honestly I find it absurdly too big to keep on my key chain. It comes with plenty of different charging types. It has the micro usb for the majority of smartphones and it has the standard apple charger (I'd have to double check but i do not think it came with the lightening charger) and it had a few other misc adaptors for charging. I only use it for my HTC Thunderbolt and have been very happy with it.4 OXA PRODUCTS 1 REVIEWI have the 4 of Oxa Portable power batteries. This review will compare the four among themselves and my use of them.OXA Juice Box S2Oxa Aluminum Alloy UltraThinOxa PerfumeOxa 2200mAh portable power.The Oxa Juice Box S2 is definitely my favorite of the four that I own. If i was only going to buy one portable power this would be the one I would want. It is capable of charging two devices at one time. But I do warn you that amount of power drains this battery really fast. I actually used it two charge my HTC smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It charged both but drained relatively fast. I like that this one has a digital display and tells you which output you are using (2.1 or 1.0) or what your charge % is at while charging or draining. The flashlight is relatively bright. All the products with flashlights are turned on by double clicking the power button in quick succession. There was no instructions for this procedure which did aggravate me. I actually had to come onto amazon and read a review in order to figure it out. So I thought Id add it to my review as well. It takes about 2.5 hours to charge completely from dead. I did notice that mine died at about 9% charge. The cable that comes with it is nice and sturdy and most of the connectors you would need for most smartphone and tablets (new and old apple connectors as well). Of all the portable power batteries this one is the bulkiest.The OXA ALUMINUM ALLOY ULTRATHIN is the 2nd bulkiest but is significantly thinner. I would also rate this as my 2nd favorite portable battery. Little blue LED indicators let you know how much charge you have in 25% increments. The LED flashlight turns on with a double click from the power button. The first one they sent me didnt work and the company immediately sent me another one without hassle so kudos to OXA for that. This one also has two charge ports (2.1 and 1.0). I used it the same way as in the previous review and it did discharge faster than the Juice Box. My biggest complaint for this one is that the cable that comes with this one was really touchy with my smartphone. I actually bought the Amazon Basics equivalent to replace the cable that came with this one. I actually prefer the Amazon Basics cables over these anyway. This one takes about 2hrs to charge completely from deadThe OXA 2200mAh my third favorite for its size and the fact that i can plug this directly into a usb charger without a cable. Amazon basics has a male to female cable that works with this too if you want a cable. This one does not come with any extra connectors so you wont be able to charge your apple products on it unfortunately. It only has a 1amp output so it works for my smartphone but my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 draws too much power from this to work effectively. My biggest suggestion for this product is the cover that goes over the USB side of it should be either tethered or hinged to the product to prevent it from getting lost. Overall good product though. This takes about an 1hr to charge from dead to complete.The OXA PERFUME is supposed to be a portable keychain battery backup. I find it way to bulky to carry on my keychain. That being said it is a great little charger. Also only has 1A output. It comes with all the connectors you need as well.  While testing this product the car charger in my car died and I needed my phones GPS to get me where I was going. This saved my butt from being late and managed to charge my phone even while my phone was using a high draw from the GPS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWMB8LA17CI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2YI052#wasThisHelpful","R1AWMB8LA17CI3","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I searched for quite awhile for an all in one prenatal multivitamin that was NOT a one a day. I have done my research and if you have to you know that one a days are not sufficient for water soluble vitamins. This has everything you need for a prenatal plus the added benefit of a separate omega 3 pack included. Since omega 3 is usually only offered as a gel cap not a solid pill they put the omega 3 inside the bottle at the top in its own separate removable pouch.My biggest complaint was that when I bought this bottle they hooked me with the subscribe and save and have only fulfilled it once. I wish they would start fulfilling it again. I may end up just switching to a different brand otherwise.P.S. Lately this product has only been available from third party sellers. I cannot leave a seller review for the company VITAGLO but if I could they would get 2 stars. I bought the product from them and they charged 10 dollars for standard shipping 7-10 days. On day 11 I sent them an email saying that I had not received the product yet. No response. I sent another email day 12. No response. On day 13 I sent another email demanding a full refund.

"I love the vermont soapworks products. I do wish they sold more of their products on amazon. This product does a great job of foaming up and lathering your hands while washing. I love the scent and that love that this is an organic and natural product.I do not like buying antibacterial soaps but I want my soap to still clean my hands. This has no problem cleaning my hands when filthy or the hands of my kids.My daughter has sensitive skin as well (eczema) and this she doesnt cause her to flair up. She says it actually feels nice.This product is SLS free and paraban free. It is only made with saponified castile and essential oils. No chemically made fragrances. This one smells great as well. Since there are no foaming chemicals in this product this will not foam up by itself. Vermont soapworks uses a few very tiny screans that when the soaps is forced through with the pump the screan causes the soap to foam up on its way out.Its a small hassle for me, but it can be annoying, the soap can have a tendency to plug the dispenser at the nozzle. It only takes a second to remove the clog but that is the only real negative I have to this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVWOA6XF122J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ81LT8#wasThisHelpful","R2JVWOA6XF122J","A1JJ489MVMW8L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JJ489MVMW8L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one heck of an upgrade. Its big, its quite, and it works. and it will continue to work for a decent amount of time. It comes with compatibility for current and future sockets. It may block your first expansion port depending on how close it is to the CPU socket. Also, if your case isn't big, like Cooler Master HAF big, it might not fit. its different than the NH-D14 in the fact that its wider and if you chose to use 1 center fan instead of both, you can fit high profile RAM. If you use both, you will need to use standard profile or low to make it fit. I personally used IC Diamond with this rather than the NT-H1 thermal compound that it came with. Its a personal choice, (ICD will give about 1 degree Celsius better than NT-H1 and will scratch the wonderful mirror finish) but i digress.This is the best air cooler on the market, (well, maybe the thermalright silver arrow is on par). I'm a quadrupedal certified Technician, and this is my go to for high performance rigs that wont go water.Don't be fooled - this can work better than some low-mid range ready made close looped water coolers. You sacrifice clearance, space and case choice for this over said water coolers, but its a darn good cooler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8QQFBXLBZ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7UZMAK#wasThisHelpful","R1M8QQFBXLBZ67","A3RDRT3F00CPQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDRT3F00CPQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This dash cam does the basic function of recording acceptably. But there are a few flaws that prevent it from being a superb product. Note that this cam does not have infrared LEDs and cannot ""see"" in total darkness or very dark environments (I deliberately choose such a cam to avoid reflections from the windshield glass).THE GOOD:+ Relatively uncomplicated, only 5 buttons.THE BAD:- Unlike other cams this one doesn't seem to have a large capacity internal battery. If you leave your car switched off for a few days (and the accessory socket doesn't supply power when off) you will find that the internal clock needs to be set next time you drive! I have seen dash cams with an internal rechargeable battery to eliminate this problem.- I don't like that the display auto shuts off and cannot remain permanently ""on"" while powered. (If you need to turn the display on if it is off you have to press the rightmost button).- The bracket is a ""move to any position and screw to secure"" type, like what some security cameras use. This is too easy to accidentally move when you didn't mean to do so. Other dash cams have a ""fixed"" bracket that is better to prevent inadvertent position adjustment.OVERALL, while it works I am not happy with some of the issues.

"This is a assembled clone of Adafruit's ProtoShield (v5). This is ideal for Arduino UNO boards. This is not the first choice for Mega2560 boards (if you need lots of I/O or a larger prototyping area) as it doesn't connect to all the Mega's pins.See learn .adafruit .com / adafruit-proto-shield-arduinoSchematic at:learn .adafruit .com / system / assets / assets / 000 / 009 / 764 / original/ v5schematic.png(Remove the spaces above)THE GOOD:+ This shield is fully assembled, unlike the Adafruit one, which was offered as a ""solder it yourself"" kit.+ There are also 2 LEDs and a button for your use. Neither is connected to any pins, so you have the flexibility to connect these as you see fit. (Both the LEDs & button are connected to GND).+ There is a Reset button on top so you can still manually reset the Arduino if you need to (normally with older Arduinos, shields may block easy access to the reset button). If you don't need another reset button you could carefully cut the reset trace and jumper the reset button to an input pin (enabling the chip pullup resistor for that pin), giving you TWO input pushbuttons instead of one.+ This PCB has wider power traces than another clone that I bought.+ Comes with mini breadboaad and male-to-male jumpers. Nice for quickly testing your ideas, plug one end of the jumper into the Arduino and the other into the breadboard!THE BAD:- No documentation of any kind included.- This design predates the R3 pinout and does not have the extended R3 pins on Uno/Mega boards. This does not mean that this shield cannot be used with these boards, just that you wouldn't have the separate SCL/SDA, IOREF pins if you absolutely need them.- This shield is NOT ""stackable"" and does NOT have ""pass through"" headers. If you're using other shields then it must be the top one but this can cause problems if you had a LCD/keypad shield as this proto shield would block it.- To cut costs no bypass capacitors C1/C2 have been installed.

"This is a nice 9V DC 2 amp power adapter with a long 8 foot cord (measured). Note that the output connector is CENTER PIN POSITIVE (which are how most devices are wired). In other words the ""inside"" of the connector is connected to +9V, and the ""outside"" is connected to DC Ground. If you need CENTER PIN NEGATIVE you need a different adapter.THE GOOD:+ Long cord, many power adapters have a short cord but this one doesn't.+ Works fine with Arduino.+ ""Universal"" switching power supply, works on 100-240V.

"This is a assembled clone of Adafruit's ProtoShield (v5) but mine has been assembled by someone who didn't know what they were doing.General:learn .adafruit .com / adafruit-proto-shield-arduinoshieldlist .org / adafruit / protoshieldSchematic:learn .adafruit .com / system / assets / assets / 000 / 009 / 764 / original/ v5schematic.png(Remove the spaces above)THE GOOD:+ This shield is fully assembled, unlike the Adafruit one, which was offered as a ""solder it yourself"" kit.+ There is a Reset button on top so you can still manually reset the Arduino if you need to (normally with older Arduinos, shields may block easy access to the reset button).+ There are also 2 LEDs and a button for your use. Neither is connected to any pins, so you have the flexibility to connect these as you see fit. (Both the LEDs & button are connected to GND).THE BAD:- No documentation included. (After searching I found the above files)- This design predates the R3 pinout and does not have the extended R3 pins on Uno/Mega boards. This does not mean that this shield cannot be used with these boards, just that you wouldn't have the separate SCL/SDA, IOREF pins if you absolutely need them.- This shield is not ""stackable"" and does not have ""pass through"" headers. If you're using other shields then it must be the top one but this can cause problems if you had a LCD/keypad shield as the proto shield would block it.- To cut costs no bypass capacitors C1/C2 have been installed. You could solder your own if you need to.- On my board, INCORRECT resistors were installed for the LED current limiting resistors R1 & R2. These were 67 ohms, you would want a higher value, like 470 - 1K ohms. Given that these were the ONLY resistors on the board how could they get this wrong?!- As if that wasn't bad enough, the 2 momentary switches were BOTH NOT WORKING! Pressing the switch would NOT complete the circuit as a ""working"" switch would. I had to remove both switches and replace them with working ones without further problems. You can test the RESET switch by pressing it, if the Arduino doesn't reset then the button doesn't work. The ""unconnected"" switch S1 can be tested with a multimeter. I suspect the board was washed with something that it should not have been after assembly and the unsealed switches were damaged!- The board has a sticky feel to it, like there is some kind of residue of it. Probably related to the above switch problems.- Packaging doesn't really protect the headers, so it is possible you might have slightly bent pins.OVERALL, it's an inexpensive prototyping shield for Arduino. But the production mistakes on this extremely simple board makes me wonder if there is any sort of quality control on these things! If you are not comfortable desoldering and soldering to fix obvious production problems you might want to skip this board (the problem is that many sell basically this same board so be warned you may have these problems if bought from another vendor). The whole point of buying this was to save me time, not make me waste time tracking down problems! Maybe the Do-It-Yourself Adafruit kit isn't so bad, I would have wasted less time assembling it instead of troubleshooting this board.UPDATE: I have found a better quality prototype PCB: Zitrades Prototyping Prototype Shield + Mini Breadboard + Free Jumper Cable for Arduino UNO Maga Nano DUE Robot.

"The RioRand W5100 is an inexpensive shield that allows Ethernet communications as well as microSD storage. The ""upgraded"" in the title is a bit untrue since this is based on an older Arduino Ethernet shield design and not the current ""Rev6"" R3-pinout design. Like most of these boards you'll have to make up your own MAC address since the board doesn't come with one, or instructions of any kind.THE GOOD:+ Inexpensive, cheaper than ""official"" Arduino Ethernet shield.+ Shield is compatible with Uno, Mega2560, and Leonardo.THE BAD:- As mentioned, this shield is NOT based on the most recent revision of the Arduino Ethernet shield. It does not support the ""full"" Uno R3 pinout (missing SCL/SDA and IOREF & the currently unused pin next to it). This does NOT mean that it does not work with Uno (it does) but if you want to ""stack"" a bunch of R3 pinout shields this one should be the topmost shield since it does not ""pass through"" the previously mentioned pins. (Actually you probably want this to be the top board in the stack for cooling requirements).- More seriously, this design does NOT include a reset IC for the W5100 chip. This was added in later versions of the official Arduino shield to eliminate problems (especially on power-up) with the W5100 not resetting and functioning properly. Since this shield doesn't have this you may need to press the RESET button to manually reset both the Arduino & the Ethernet shield. (I feel this was done to keep costs down).- Even though it is ""Mega compatible"" I notice that the base Mega2560 Arduino's A6 pin is somewhat blocked by the shield when in place. This may be true for the ""Arduino"" manufactured shield as well.- This older design does not have the vacant holes for the option POE (Power Over Ethernet) module. (Most people wouldn't use this so it wouldn't be a big deal).- Packaging is inadequate to prevent bent pins. I had to straighten a few of them.OVERALL, the price is good but at this point in time it is disappointing to see that old designs are still being sold years after the newer R3 pinout & reset issue have been addressed. There are reset modifications you can do to the board to help with the W5100 problem but you really shouldn't have to on a new board.I hope you have found this helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KT2I007A606K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU7447Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KT2I007A606K","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1602 is the most inexpensive 2x16 LCD display (controlled by I2C, uses the PCF8574 chip) that I have found. The benefit of using an I2C display is that only 2 I/O signals are needed from/to your microcontroller, saving you precious I/O pins. Also, with I2C you can add additional displays and other I2C devices without using additional I/O pins.This is not an ""Arduino-only"" device and is not a ""plug-in"" shield. This is both good and bad. The good point is that you can use this with other microcontrollers, not just limited to Arduino. Also, because it only needs 4 wires you could mount this as part of a ""front panel"" interface separate from the Arduino. If using with Arduino you will need to do some easy connections to hook it up. Here's how I got mine working with Arduino.HARDWARE INTERFACING:This is a 5V powered device, so LCD-VCC goes to 5V, LCD-GND to GND. The 2 remaining LCD connections SCL & SDA depend on which Arduino model you are using.On the Uno  LCD-SCL goes to A5, LCD-SDA goes to A4 (For Uno R3 boards you could also connect LCD-SCL/SDA to the separate SCL/SDA pins on ends of the ""digital"" connector but be aware that this is the same as connecting to A4 & A5 as there are no ""separate dedicated"" SCL/SDA pins for Uno). NOTE: Remember that's A4/A5 not D4/D5.For Leonardo you use 3 (SCL) & 2 (SDA).For the Mega2560 you will need to use 21 (SCL) & 20 (SDA).Also, it is important to know that I2C pins should each have pull-up resistors to 5V (2.2K to 4.7K should work). I believe the Arduino Wire library enables the weak internal chip pullups but best practice means that you should have pull-ups on both SCL & SDA. I'll say it again: the LCD may not work reliably if you don't have a pull-up resistor on both SCL/SDA!The potentiometer on the back is to adjust the LCD's contrast. Turn it up all the way and you should see white blocks (this is a quick way to test the display to make sure there are no ""dead pixels"").CONFUSING THING #1If you look at the back of the I2C interface board you will see what appears to be a jumper with the labels ""VCC"" and ""GND"" next to it. You might be wondering if you will fry something because of this. You wouldn't, because the jumper is for backlight control, and the labels actually refer to the unpopulated pins for another set of I2C pins. The jumper can be removed to disable the backlight, but that will make the LCD almost impossible to read, so leave it in!SOFTWARE INTERFACING:My display came with no jumpers soldered on the Address pads, so the LCD's I2C address is 0x27.If using with Arduino there is a library that will make your life easy. Download it from bitbucket dot org /fmalpartida /new-liquidcrystal /wiki/Home(Remove the spaces and convert dot org above)You can also try searching for ""LiquidCrystal_V1.2.1.zip""First (re)move your original LiquidCrystal folder in your Arduino libraries folder.You want to extract the LiquidCrystal folder in the zip to the libraries folder.In your sketch, you have the following code at the top:#define LCD1602_I2C_ADDRESS 0x27#include <Wire.h> //needed to prevent compile errors#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>// next line sets up  address, en, rw, rs, d4, d5, d6, d7, backlight, blpolarityLiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(LCD1602_I2C_ADDRESS, 2,1,0,4,5,6,7,3,POSITIVE);in your setup() function:lcd.begin (16,2);  // setup for 2x16 displayin your loop() function:lcd.clear();  delay(500);  lcd.backlight();  delay(500);  lcd.print(""Testing LCD"");  delay(1000);  lcd.noBacklight();Note that you can control the backlight via software! (noBacklight & backlight).THE GOOD:+ Works, once you wire everything correctly and use the correct library and I2C device address. (The display outputs white text on a blue background).+ There is a power LED on the I2C interface board so you can tell if it is powered.+ Backlight can be controlled via software (you will need the backlight jumper plugged in). Note that you DON'T need a separate I/O pin to control the backlight since it is connected to the I2C interface chip and driven from it. By the way the backlight uses approx 19mA on my LCD (measured). NOTE: The backlight jumper allows very easy measurement of the backlight LED current, simply remove the jumper and measure current through both pins with the backlight turned on.+ A0/A1/A2 address jumpers are vacant so by soldering some jumpers you could have multiple displays (with different addresses) on the same I2C bus if needed.+ Price is very attractive, at less than 10 bucks for a display with backlight and an I2C interface attached. You could even buy this just for the display alone (desoldering the I2C interface board) and use it as a parallel LCD.THE BAD:- No documentation of any kind included!- Display update speed is kind of slow (I don't mean because of the I2C communication, but the display itself. Text displayed on previous blank areas sort of ""fades in"" and becomes white). If you are familiar with older ""black on green"" LCD displays that updated instantly this is a bit of a drawback. But it's one that is acceptable for the price.- There are no 0.1uF bypass or electrolytic filter caps on the I2C interface board. Since the LCD module is separate from the Arduino by (potentially long) wires I feel it should have a cap or two.I have spent a couple hours getting the LCD to work (because of no instructions) and decided to leave a detailed review so others can get started quickly. If you don't mind doing a little work with the wiring and not having a ""plug-in shield"" I would recommend this display over more expensive ""plug-in"" LCD shields.I hope you have found this helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y06SU0JG40DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOMLMYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y06SU0JG40DA","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ZyXELP660R-F1 is probably the simplest DSL modem that you can buy in terms of setup/configuration. Unlike other modems you do not have to navigate and manually setup VPI/VCI, Encapsulation mode, etc. The modem will autodetect these and all you will need is your PPPoE username and password (Ask your DSL provider if you don't have this info).Firstly, you connect the modem's phone line, Ethernet, & power adapter, switch on and wait a minute for the modem to finish booting. (If you are like most users you'd plug the Ethernet cable into the modem then the other end goes to the WAN port on your WiFi router).All you need to do is attempt to access the internet (any web site) and the modem should prompt you for the modem's login password, your PPPoE username and corresponding password. At that point the modem should login via PPPoE and the Internet should be accessible. That's pretty much it. (Note that your setup could be different depending on your ISP).I am getting slightly better speeds compared to my old modem (nothing major but that's a good sign).THE GOOD:+ Small device, with side & top vents for cooling. I have found most modern devices simply don't have very good cooling. With the side vents you could stand it on the side or at an angle for better cooling (which I recommend doing). Do NOT cover the vents or impede airflow!+ Status LEDs are easy to read at a glance. There are only 4 LEDs (Power, Ethernet, DSL, Internet).+ Powered by a standard 12VDC 1 amp power supply so easy to replace if it fails. Some old DSL modems use weird power supply adapters.+ Status screen shows modem uptime, DSL & LAN status, WAN IP address, etc.+ Supports Dynamic DNS via DynDNS+ Has on/off switch so it is easier to turn on/off than yanking the plug out.THE BAD:- First, the login screen can trip you up. When you access the modem (default 192.168.1.1) you will see a ""Login"" screen with a password prompt, but it appears that the password prompt is already filled on (i.e. has password dots indicating characters). You can click ""Login"" without entering a password and you will see the modem's ""Status"" screen BUT NO OTHER OPTIONS WILL APPEAR. To get the ""full"" menu options you will need to enter the password at the Login screen, which will bring you to the same ""Status"" screen but with additional options. Remember, if you need to configure the modem you need to enter the password at the Login screen!- To check DSL line parameters like Signal-to-noise margin, Attenuation etc you need to check under Maintenance/Diagnostic/DSL Line/DSL Line Status. Strangely the upstream/downstream values are not ordered logically (downstream/upstream should be grouped together but they are not). I feel these should have been shown on the status page rather than having to dig deep to find them.- Cooling is still not optimal. The placement of the ""main"" chip is halfway under the front of the modem's top cover (which has no ventilation!). Also, I feel the chip should have a passive heatsink on it for better heat dissipation and reliability.- Modem has ""Windows Networking (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) allow between LAN & WAN"" CHECKED by default(!). Recommend unchecking this for security reasons.OVERALL, it is a easy-to-setup DSL modem. It's too early to remark on long-term reliability but I will update this as time goes by.I hope you have found this helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWT131J9T58RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFNHK4A#wasThisHelpful","RWT131J9T58RV","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The SuperRetro pack contains 2 SNES wireless controllers (using RF not infrared so there are no issues like having to keep controllers pointed in the right direction) that fit the SNES connector ports. The receiver units (one for each port) are powered by the system so no batteries are required for those. However you will need 2 ""AAA"" batteries for EACH controller (not included). The antenna is internal so there are no clumsy antennas or wires hanging outside of each controller.** Syncing each controller with a receiver **1. Power on game system with receiver(s) plugged in.2. Turn on controller power switch.3. HOLD down Start & Select until LED on controller flashes. Release buttons on controller.4. On receiver HOLD down CONNECT button until LED flashes (should be done within 10 seconds of Step 3). Release button.5. When both LEDs stop flashing and stay on the controller should be working. Repeat procedure for other controller if necessary.Note: You DO NOT have to do this procedure every time you use the controllers.THE GOOD:+ Product works (I tested it on a Hyperkin RetroN 3 Video Gaming System, Charcoal which plays NES, SNES & Genesis games and has controller ports for each system).THE BAD:- Instructions don't mention that EACH controller has a tiny power switch on the inside curve (below the D-pad). I was puzzled why the red LED didn't come on after installing batteries until I found the switch. After you are finished playing you should switch off both controllers for maximum battery life.- The shape/design of the controller seems to be best for smaller hands (possibly kids). I wish they were a little larger. This is not an exact copy of the original SNES controllers (as you can tell by the different shape). However note that I do not have a set of original SNES controllers to compare with.- The D-pad could be better. I find the feel a little off (especially for diagonals but perhaps it takes some getting used to).OVERALL, it works and if you are tired of tripping over cords this might be what you need. It's difficult to give an opinion on controller ""feel"" since this is subjective and everyone has different tastes.Nevertheless I hope you have found this review useful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNEAXEZMMLFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083LSCZ8#wasThisHelpful","RMNEAXEZMMLFF","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you simply want an easy way to play the games you remember (provided you have the cartridges) this console is a good choice but it's not without flaws. The system itself comes with 2 infrared wireless controllers, AC power adapter, composite video/audio cable and an S-VIDEO cable. Note that S-VIDEO does not carry audio so you will still need to use the audio connectors of the composite cable. Controllers each require 2 ""AAA"" batteries (not included).Strangely no instruction manual was included in the package. The 2 controllers look identical but above the ""select"" button is either a single or double dot which indicates which player that controller is used for. There is no user-selectable method to change a controller from 1P to 2P (or vice versa).THE GOOD:+ Plays NES, SNES & Genesis/MegaDrive cartridges all on one system.+ Compact design, certainly takes up less space than having 3 separate systems.+ A big plus is that the system has controller ports for the 3 systems so it can accept wired controllers which you can use instead of the included wireless controllers.+ There is a region switch (labelled ""O/J"", presumably for Overseas/Japan) so you can play carts for other regions.+ For SNES it appears that Super FX games are compatible. I have tried Stunt Race FX and it works.THE BAD:- The included wireless controllers are a problem, especially with 2 players. These controllers use infrared light (like your TV remote) as opposed to RF so they must be line-of-sight with the system unit. But more important the use of IR means that you will probably experience control issues with 2 players simultaneously (imagine trying to change your TV channel or volume using 2 remotes at the same time). Specifically controllers may not register input or have some lag in the response - for videogames this can cause frustration and render most games unplayable. I STRONGLY recommend than you get wired controllers to use instead of the wireless ones.- Depending on the system, the wireless controller button mapping may not match the labelled buttons. As an example the ""B"" button is really ""A"" for NES games (this is an attempt to match the physical button placement of the original controller to the wireless one). It can be a little confusing though, especially for SNES games where the wireless controller does not have the 2 ""shoulder"" buttons where the original SNES controller does. You will probably want to remap controls in each game but this will have to be done after power-up for each game.- I find the picture a little ""noisy"" regardless whether the composite video or S-VIDEO outputs were used. Also I think there is a slight difference in brightness between the two - S-VIDEO seems to output a higher brightness display. For most games you will not notice this noise in the picture.- As other reviewers have noted there may be minor differences in sound etc compared to the original systems.OVERALL, it's one of the few ""new systems"" to play games for the 3 old systems. (Although I have not tested it with NES games because I don't have any).If anyone from Hyperkin reads this I think this could have been a mostly perfect 3-in-1 system with some changes:* Noisy picture fixed* Use of RF controllers instead of IR ones* Have some sort of ""boot menu"" that you can permanently remap buttons for each system, maybe on a ""per game"" basis depending on the inserted cart.* What would REALLY be awesome is if it had SD card support for ""homebrew"" games that you could download (in addition to the cartridge slots)I hope you have found this review useful, and don't forget to clean your cartridge contacts before using them for best results!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJLKCHE67HIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5AHPG#wasThisHelpful","R1SJLKCHE67HIM","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TL-SG1005D is a 5-port gigabit switch that is inexpensive and ""just plain works"". However the front panel design could have been better. Also note the case is plastic not metal, which is cheaper.THE GOOD:+ Support Jumbo frames up to 9K (according to the manual)+ Front panel LED flash rate is slow enough to easily see from across the room.+ Like most modern switches this one is ""green"" - uses less power for shorter Ethernet cables and powers down unused ports to save energy.+ Single-chip switch controller is heatsinked for better heat dissipation.THE BAD:- Wall mount screws are not included.- The front panel LEDs are single color (green) and do not change color to indicate ""gigabit device connected"" like some other switches. Thus you cannot tell if a device is gigabit or not from looking at the front panel.- There is only a single LED per port and not separate Link/Activity LEDs like on some other switches. This may have been done to keep costs down.- The Power LED is the same color as the Port LEDs. I would have preferred the Power LED be a different color (red) than the green LEDs used for the ports.OVERALL it's a good choice for a gigabit switch. However I would have really liked to see a way of determining connected device speed from looking at the front panel.

"The TP-Link PA211 Kit comprises of 2 powerline adapters at an attractive price.THE GOOD:+ Cheaper than most other 200Mbps powerline adapters.+ The physical size of this powerline adapter is smaller than most of the others that I've used.+ The ""pair"" button placement is under the adapter (next to where the network cable plugs into) as opposed to on the size of the adapter (as found on most other devices). This is better because you are less likely to accidentally press it when plugging/unplugging.+ Utility software is better than the ZyXEL PLA407 HomePlug AV 200 Mbps Powerline Wall-Plug Adapter (Starter Kit - 2 Units) that I have previously reviewed.+ The power-off timeout (when no Ethernet device is connected to the adapter) is longer than on the Zyxel PLA-407 and is stated as 10 minutes in the manual. This is good as the Zxyel PLA-407 would go to sleep in 1 minute unless something was plugged into the Ethernet port. This made configuration difficult using the utility software. Happy to say that the TP-Link PA211 has a sensible ""on"" time before going to sleep.THE BAD:- Device password (required for setting Privacy/Network name for remote devices that are not directly connected via Ethernet) must be in ALL CAPS and dashes entered. I don't know why the utility software doesn't auto-capitalize password input since only caps are valid. If you enter in lower case you will get an ""invalid password"" error. Also the utility does not indicate that passwords should be entered in all caps.- Unlike most powerline adapters the powerline LED does NOT change color to indicate connection quality. It is always green (Most other powerline adapters that I've used from Netgear, Zyxel etc change the LED color red/amber/green to indicate line quality). You can still check the line rate & quality settings via the TP-Link powerline utility software but it is FAR easier to just plug the adapter in different outlets and watch the LED to get an idea of whether this outlet is ""better/worse"" than another. This in my opinion is a significant disadvantage to the TP-PA211.- There is some ""bleed-through"" of the Panel LEDs, so sometimes it appears that an LED is ON when it is really OFF (due to light from the adjacent LED). This affects the powerline LED the most as it is in the middle of the 3 LEDs.OVERALL, I would recommend this powerline adapter despite the few flaws. It is cheap, small, has functional utility software and works. If you can put up with the front LED shortcomings mentioned above it is a good choice for a powerline adapter. I have noticed that most TP-Link products are priced aggressively compared to traditional brands and seem to be just as good.I hope you have found this review useful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UN8Q7PHMG26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055XKBW4#wasThisHelpful","R5UN8Q7PHMG26","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Next Life (called Reprobates in Europe) is an adventure game with good graphics but has some flaws that affect the experience. The concept is great - the player apparently dies in the starting cutscene but wakes up on an island with 9 other characters who have seemingly also ""died"". Everyone always falls asleep when the bell tower rings 3 times and everybody suffers terrible nightmares while sleeping (For you these nightmares are mini-adventures that you need to solve to return to the ""island""). Probably the scariest part is that some people just disappear after falling asleep - they are just ""gone"" the next morning. It's your job to figure out what's going on here and escape the island if possible.This is a spoiler-free review so I will not ruin any surprises for you.THE GOOD:+ 3D Graphics/2D backgrounds are good for an adventure game. The 3D models of characters are great (especially the women, who have been modeled with considerable attention-to-detail).+ The plot can hold your attention even during the weaker parts of the game. The nightmares are ""scary"" scenarios that are very different from the relatively leisurely ""island"" daytime part of the game. I would say the ""nightmare"" parts of the game is where it really shines.+ Game is stable, never crashed for me while playing.+ 3D graphics requirements are pretty low - I played the game with ""shadows on"" with a Radeon 4350 (low end graphics card) and it was fine.THE BAD:- There are 3 or 4 ""timed"" minigames that must be solved to proceed at different points in the game. These either rely on ""do something before time runs out"" or ""quick reaction before time runs out"". I dislike these and I absolutely hated the ""spinning circle light"" puzzle - I had to use a save game from the internet to pass this since I couldn't solve it in time (and I tried repeatedly).- English translation is not very good. The game has been developed by a foreign developer and some ""Engrish"" can be expected but when the game tells you ""I knocked it in the lubber"" or describing a tree as ""an old bark"" or your player asking another character ""are you ventilating your feet?"" or describing a crack in a rock as ""a rent in the rock"" it really distracts from the experience. Similarly the captions don't exactly match the spoken audio (when conversing with another character).- As with most adventure games you have to ""pixel hunt"". This game has tiny ""pixel areas"" so make sure you carefully move your mouse over everything!- Game is ""trigger"" based, so even if you figure out what you need to do next you will still have to perform the right ""trigger"" to get things rolling. Triggers may be talking to the right person or doing a specific task.- Your player character moves slowly especially when turning or climbing. Towards the end of the game there is a stage with lots of painful clicking as you navigate the up/down terrain - why your player couldn't just walk normally over it I have no idea, especially when it serves not much purpose except to slow the player down. Here's a tip: Pressing the ""E"" key shows offscreen exits for a brief time - use this often to make sure you aren't missing a place to go (this is important in the ""lava"" terrain stage). Also doubleclicking an offscreen exit makes your player run (faster than walking).- The load save screen defaults (on first startup every time you start the game) to the 1st save, not the last save and you have to click repeatedly to navigate to the last save. I completed the game with around 100 saves & it is a little annoying when you first start the game and want to load the most recent save.- The ending stage part of the game seems a little rushed/short and not all the engrossing compared to the rest.- The ending cutscene should have been better & shown what happened to the ""other"" characters.OVERALL, if you are an adventure game player (which usually means that you have considerable patience) you probably will enjoy this game (apart from the timed sequences and occasional illogical solution to a puzzle).I hope you have found this review helpful!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MA8AOALMDHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VPNSIU#wasThisHelpful","R25MA8AOALMDHC","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used other powerline adapters (primarily Netgear). The only advantage the PLA-407 has is the noise-filtering front outlet but this is outweighed by the awful software & difficult encryption setup.THE GOOD:+ Noise filtering front outlet allows you to plug in extension cords or other devices without affecting the PLA network speed due to noisy devices. Note that the PLA-407 is a 200Mbps powerline device (there are faster 500Mbps devices but these are typically more expensive)+ Adapter supports manually-set priority levels PER ADAPTER. You can designate an adapter to have higher priority than another one set to ""Normal"" for example. Note this is not ""true"" Quality of Service based on analysis of transmitted data etc but a simple priority scheme to allow certain adapters to have better/worse priority than others.THE BAD:The Zyxel PLA config utility v4.1.2 software is truly awful:- The configuration screen is not intuitive or friendly. The config utility seems like a prototype and not a production/end-user tool.- The utility does not show the existing network name (NMK) so you cannot tell if all adapters are setup correctly with the same name. (What Zyxel calls the network name other manufacturers refer to as the powerline password). This may be for security reasons, so you better keep track of your network name otherwise if you want to add a device later and don't remember the name you'll have to reconfig the name on all PLA devices.- Related to the above point, since you CANNOT tell what the network name is you can't tell whether the PLA is using the default (i.e. unsecure) name or a custom name. This means you will have to keep notes, especially if setting up multiple adapters.- The firmware update function is handled by a separate utility which must be downloaded. The firmware utility says ""Your device is doing with new firmware"" when updating (no, that's not my typo).- The default ""green power-down"" feature can confuse you when using the PC config utility if you don't realise that a PLA adapter that does not have an ethernet connection to a powered-up device will go to ""sleep"" after 60 seconds and will NOT show up or respond in the PC config utility. The default timeout should be longer than 60 seconds to accommodate setup. (As an aside there seems to be no way to extend or disable the low power mode from the PC config utility). I'm all for saving power but this makes simultaneous configuration difficult (i.e. multiple adapters at the same time) as they will all need to be connected to a POWERED-UP device with an ethernet port) to prevent them from going to sleep!- At 1st glance there appears to be no way to figure out what firmware version each PLA is using from the config utility. Hidden in the ""about"" icon (next to the question mark) it shows the utility version and ""firmware version"" but I have no idea which adapter has this firmware (i.e. it is showing a firmware version but not indicating which adapter has this version - remember the utility can show multiple adapters)- The firmware utility doesn't show the existing version before upgrading.- The encryption method using the button procedure indicated in the user guide PDF did not work for me - as another reviewer noted the LEDs don't flash as the manual indicates. I believe the manual is incorrect.OVERALL I don't recommend this PLA adapter if you care about configuring/implementing security because of the PC config software - shame on you Zyxel for having the worst software that I've ever seen on a powerline adapter (Zyxel: get the guys who did the excellent interface on the NSA320 NAS to fix your PLA software!)If you don't care about security and plug it in ""out of the box"" (with no security) then this may work for you. But there are cheaper PLA solutions (especially if you don't need the front noise-filtering outlet) such as the TP-Link Powerline Adapter (TL-PA211 STARTER KIT).I hope you have found this helpful!","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IU38GDCWEFKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ULOZ5W#wasThisHelpful","R3IU38GDCWEFKZ","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 2 of these routers (version 1). This router is a ""N"" dual band 2.4GHz/5GHz with 4 100MBit Fast Ethernet ports (NOT Gigabit Ethernet). It also features a USB2 port which can be used to share storage if you plug in a USB hard drive. There are no positionable or external antennas.Also for some strange reason this router is model N600 as well as WNDR3400. Currently on amazon N600 brings up 2 different routers. Be sure that you're looking at the right one!THE GOOD:+ Very stable & reliable, has not required resetting despite power glitches etc.+ Router supports 300Mbps on both 2.4GHz & 5GHz bands.+ Router has auto-update firmware check on entering web interface.+ Dynamic DNS works perfectly with DynDNS service.+ Bandwidth usage stats are an interesting feature - you can get an idea of exactly how much bandwidth you really use (up/down totals for today/this week/this month/last month).+ You can enable/disable router via schedule.+ You can support ""guest"" networks on both 2.4GHz/5GHz bands with isolation from your ""other"" connected devices. This means you can give a guest internet access without worrying about privacy concerns.THE BAD:- Not easily wall mountable. There are no mounting holes underneath as in most routers.- DHCP could be better implemented:1. DHCP reservation requires router reboot to work correctly (after setting up reservation). The problem here is that if you reboot you will lose bandwidth statistics.2. There are no advanced config settings for DHCP like lease time etc as in other routers.- 5 GHz range is not very good compared to 2.4GHz, although this may not be specific to this router (I don't have another dual-band router to test against).OVERALL, I would recommend this router, especially if you are tired of others that need to be periodically reset. However you should ensure there is proper airflow around the router. I use a small box to prop up one end of the horizontally-mounted router to ensure hot air can easily rise thru the top vents. The one thing that might be a deal breaker for some is the lack of Gigabit Ethernet ports. (For the price I think it should have it).If you need Gigabit but don't need Dual band you might want to look at TRENDnet 300 Mbps Wireless N Gigabit Router TEW-639GR (Black) (which is actually cheaper at the time of writing this).I hope you have found this helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XTUC0V4B7AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041LYY6K#wasThisHelpful","R34XTUC0V4B7AS","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know what ""normal"" yellow mustard tastes like. S&B hot mustard ain't that. This is a dry powder you mix with water and allow to sit a minute or two to develop the full flavor.And by flavor I mean an all out assault on your nasal passages (especially if you try too much!). It's kinda like English mustard but even more intense. (I am sure this mustard will play a lead role in ""The Expendables 3"").Anyway this mustard smells/tastes similar to the little packets of hot mustard you get at Chinese restaurants but with much more WAHOO!If you haven't been scared off yet I recommend trying it.

"The Antec NP90 is a universal adapter/charger that comes with 7 different replaceable tips to fit a variety of different laptops. (See my photos for closeup of the tips)THE GOOD:+ Adapter is a 90 Watt output adapter, can power most 65 watt laptops with power to spare. 90W is the adapter's maximum rated power output, it's okay if your laptop/existing adapter has a power rating less than 90W as the laptop will use whatever power it needs from the adapter (in other words it's OK to power a less-than-90W laptop from a 90W adapter). In fact, due to the slightly larger size of the power adapter ""brick"" it will likely run cooler than your existing adapter.+ Power cords are long. AC adapter cord (that plugs into the wall) is 5 feet, the laptop power cord is 6 feet.+ The tips are keyed to fit only one way for proper operation so you can't fry your laptop by plugging in the tips the wrong way onto the cord and reversing polarity. (Believe it or not I have seen a cheap generic adapter that had this dangerous ""feature"").+ Adapter has power LED so you can tell it's plugged in/working.THE BAD:- Because it is a 90W adapter it is physically bigger than most adapters (and is likely larger than the adapter you use right now).- It is expensive compared to the cheaper ""generic"" adapters that are designed for a specific model.- Some laptops will not work with this charger. (e.g. newer Dells that communicate with the charger and refuse to charge unless it is a ""Dell"" charger).OVERALL I would recommend this especially as your ""home"" or ""work"" adapter (i.e. the one that doesn't travel with you).

"The TopLink TK1005G is a small durable 5-port gigabit switch that's a good choice if you DON'T need to wall mount it. There are NO screw holes underneath (see images) unlike most switches.THE GOOD:+ Metal durable case, looks like it can take a few knocks without damage (watch out for falls though, the power connector could possibly be damaged). The metal case has ventilation holes on both the left/right sides for airflow.+ Metal case makes it heavier. Why is this a good thing? Well, with many plastic-cased desktop switches the switch is so light that the connected network cables tend to move/flip the switch. A heavier switch helps reduce that.+ The single chip inside the case has a heatsink on it, which should lead to lower temperatures and better reliability.+ The front panel power LED is a different color (red) from the rest of the LEDs.+ The switch indicates whether a port is 1Gbit by lighting up a separate LED from the Link/Activity LED. Thus you can tell at a glance if a device is connected at gigabit speeds. (Some 1Gbit switches do not have port speed LEDs so you can't tell the speed of devices).THE BAD:- Not wall mountable.- I wish though the LEDs on the front panel were a bit larger.- The Link/Activity LED flash rate is too fast - you need to be close to the switch to observe it (it is difficult to see from a couple feet away).OVERALL it's a good switch despite not being wall mountable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6U11CCWJG2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GGE72U#wasThisHelpful","R3G6U11CCWJG2Z","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the owner of a somewhat mentally unstable caique parrot I had reservations that he would actually eat this. Fortunately he definitely likes it and since it contains vitamins/minerals it's better for him than seed mix (it's a bad idea to feed your bird solely seed mix anyway). Each round ""berry"" is made up of seeds, corn and nuts, coated to retain its shape (it smells kind of like peanut butter to me!). If your bird doesn't like pellets (mine doesn't) give this a try.The only downside is that (with all bird food) some of it goes to waste - birds aren't into food conservation and drop food frequently! If the berries were a bit larger they would not fall through the cage bars (Mr Bird's cage has fairly wide bars at the bottom and half-eaten berries fall through).UPDATE: There is a larger ""berry"" size available, see Lafeber's Classic Nutri-Berries for Macaw / Cockatoo 3.5 lb.

"Reviewed: Zyxel NSA325. It supports 2 x 3.5"" SATA drives, has 2 USB2 ports (back) and a single USB3 (front) & has Gigabit Ethernet. 1.6GHz Marvell processor is faster than older NAS devices (faster than the 800MHz CPU in the D-LINK DNS-320 or the 1.2GHz CPU in the DNS-325) and 512MB memory allows multiple functions at same time.DRIVE INSTALLATION:Drive guide rails must be attached to each drive via screws. Note that the pointy end of the rails must face INWARD (i.e. on the same side as the SATA connector). The quick install sheet doesn't mention this and it's easy to overlook from the diagram. The reason for the specific orientation is that you use a tool (located behind the drive cover) to remove an installed drive from its bay and this tool clips onto the exposed end of the drive rails. Also when installing be sure to insert the drive so that the SATA connector will mate with the drive (it will not if you insert the drive the wrong way and you could cause damage). ZyXEL needs to have better instructions. The front door is a little flimsy though, be careful when removing/installing to avoid breaking the tabs that keep it in place.Note that drives are NOT hot-swappable, do not remove/insert with the power on. Drives up to 3TB are supported with newest firmware (note if you have old firmware you will need to temporarily install a smaller drive, create a volume, then use the firmware check function in the web interface to update firmware before installing 3TB drives).RAID:RAID 0/1 are supported. RAID 0 uses the combined storage space of both drives but has no redundancy. RAID 1 mirrors contents on both drives so if one fails your data is still safe.POWER MANAGEMENT/UPS:+ You can connect a (APC brand) UPS to the NAS via one of the USB ports and it will auto-shutdown when UPS battery is low (you can adjust when the shutdown occurs based on the UPS reported capacity remaining). A nice touch and one that will help prevent data loss. I tried it with a Tripp-Lite UPS and it wasn't recognized so it looks like only an APC will work.+ You can set the UPS to always power on after a power failure, useful if acting as networked storage.+ You can spin down drives if no data transmission occurs in a specified time (adjustable in minutes)+ Supports ""wake-on-lan"" so device can turn on and service incoming requests even if powered off.+ NAS uses external 12V 5amp power adapter. This is better than an internal power supply as it is easily replaceable if it fails.+ Interestingly the NAS has an internal clock (powered by a CR2032 battery) and can be set to power on/off via time schedule.THE BAD:- There is no ""network activity"" LED at the front panel (the LED is on the Ethernet jack). I would have liked to see a front panel LED. This is important as use of one of the back USB ports will block the network LED on the jack.- I do not think there is a way to migrate to larger capacity drives without backing up/replacing drives/recreate RAID/restoring the array.- Download Manager feature (more on this below) cannot download files that require authentication from websites (i.e. files that require login). This is a shame as this would been much more useful.- This NAS takes LONG to boot. This may cause a problem if used as network storage as PCs may boot quicker than the NAS!- For some strange reason the CPU temp is reported incorrectly (12 deg Celsius) on the NSA status page after some time in operation. It still seems to work correctly so this may be a minor bug.OTHER:+ Front panel USB connector is USB3 for fast copy from/to external USB3 devices. This is just for copying data from/to an external drive, I don't think connection to a PC is supported.+ NAS has CPU temp sensor.+ The fan is a 3-wire fan (has RPM sensor so the NAS can determine fan speed). The fan label mentions that has a hypro bearing, which supposed to be a long-lasting bearing. The fan is very quiet, practically silent.+ Web-based interface is nice and clean, with attractive icons. The admin setup webpage is logically organized. You can check the CPU temp/CPU load/free memory from the admin page.+ ZPilot feature allows you to drop files/folders to an ""always-on-top"" icon to copy to the NAS. Optionally you can have the NAS sort files into specific folders based on the file type.+ Add-on packages really expand functionality of the NAS. For example installing the SMART package allows you to see the status (temperature, SMART status, model & serial #) of the installed drives.+ Firmware update is totally painless, one click will check for new firmware, another click downloads & installs it. You don't need to download it from a PC then upload it to the NAS. However note that you must have drive(s) installed and a volume created to use the auto-update feature as it needs to download firmware to the volume. If no drive(s) are installed it will not work.+ Has ""Download Manager"" built-in file download function & bittorrent client. By logging into the NAS and either entering the URL of a file to download OR uploading a .torrent file from your PC you can have the NAS download files unattended without having your PC on and running. A nice feature, especially for downloading large files such as Linux ISO images.OVERALL it's a good media server for the price and I recommend it. But also check out the ZyXEL NSA320 2-bay Network Attached Storage and Media Server as it is similar but about half the price. The NSA320 uses a slightly slower 1.2GHz CPU (but has the same 512MB memory), but doesn't have dropbox features or USB3 port. You probably DON'T want the older NSA2xx series because these use a much slower CPU/less memory and transfer performance is not as good.UPDATE: I now have multiple NSA325s and the only thing I have found problematic is the web interface. There have been times when the NSA325 is still on and working but I cannot login to its IP address (to get the web interface to display). Other times the web interface will be extremely slow to respond or even stop responding entirely. Also, the ""firmware upgrade notification"" message keeps appearing even though I'm on the latest firmware (which is annoying, even though I click ""do not remind me""). Power resetting fixes the web interface problems but I should not have to do this. These problems have persisted even through firmware updates and I am disappointed that such basic bugs have not been dealt with.UPDATE2: One of the 2 drives in one NSA325 dropped dead. I found this odd so investigated a bit and found a flaw. The single cooling fan was failing (very slow RPMs) and the drive overheated until failure. There are 2 things wrong that could have helped prevent this: (1) Even though the system monitors the RPM of the fan there is no warning that I could find except in the log. A fan failure SHOULD send an email and/or beep the buzzer to signify that something is wrong. (2) The enclosure only has intake vents on the bottom, not the top. This means that hot air will be trapped inside the enclosure should the fan fail. As a result of this experience I recommend buying StarTech.com 60x10mm Replacement Ball Bearing Computer Case Fan with TX3 Connector FAN6X1TX3 (Black) and replacing the original fan. The fan is a standard 60mm x 10mm with a 3-pin ""CPU heatsink"" connector. Also, once a week login to the web interface and check the fan speed for indication of failure (so you can catch failures early). Other NAS units such as the DS413j have dual fans for redundancy.A more expensive and larger capacity NAS alternative is the Synology DiskStation 4-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS413j. (See my DS413j review for more).I hope this is helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVF2SCIVO1ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JLDTRY#wasThisHelpful","R3GVF2SCIVO1ZS","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hydroclean HC660 is a replacement toilet fill valve that fits most toilets. I used it on an older American Standard toilet tank installed in the 1980s. It fit fine and cured the problem with the old fill valve, namely the tank was taking FOREVER to fill (over 10 minutes!). Now it takes about 90 seconds to fill, a vast improvement.THE GOOD:+ Hydroclean tubing & nozzles agitate the tank while filling, allowing sediment to drain out with the next flush. This is the main benefit of this valve, which supposedly keeps debris/sediment from accumulating on the flapper (which can cause leaks since the flapper doesn't seal properly).+ The next benefit is that there is a mini-valve which allows adjustment of the water flow to the overflow tube i.e. the amount of water that fills the bowl after flushing (during tank filling). You can restrict the water flow so that less water fills the bowl - the theory is that many bowls are actually overfilled during tank refilling which wastes water.+ The nut that tightens and attaches the fill valve to the tank is designed to ""click"" as you tighten it so you don't accidentally overtighten and crack the tank. Instructions suggest tightening 1 to 3 clicks (I did 2 clicks). You don't even need a wrench or other tool to tighten this nut.+ You can adjust the height of the fill valve to fit your tank (when installing) and also easily adjust the water fill level by turning a knob.+ There is also a ""float lock"" so you can stop the tank from refilling without turning off the water supply to the toilet. This is useful for repairs (for example when replacing the flapper) and is more of a convenience rather than an essential feature.THE BAD:- Compared to an ""old style"" ballcock fill valve (i.e. the ones with the air-filled ball float) the fill valve feels a little plastic and a little flimsy. However this may just be the difference in old vs newer construction. (Hope the plastic is stronger than it looks)- The instructions mention a ""cone supply washer"" & ""water supply nut"" which were not included (for me anyway). I did not need these but am just mentioning it.OVERALL, I would recommend this fill valve. It is very similar to the cheaper Fluidmaster 400A Anti-Siphon Toilet Tank Fill Valve (which does not include the Hydroclean or mini-valve features so you might want to buy the Fluidmaster instead if you don't care about those features). I would suggest taking the opportunity to also replace the flapper in the toilet at the same time you change the fill valve since it can cause water-wasting leaks (and generally has to be replaced every couple of years anyway). REMEMBER: Do not use chemical ""in-tank"" cleaners as they can damage plastic parts!I hope this has been helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMLXMD6YRB3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000L87RKC#wasThisHelpful","R1WMLXMD6YRB3C","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 2 of the Fenix HP10 (older model LED headlamp) and had high expectations for the HP11. Sorry to say that the HP11 is WORSE in several important ways:- The on/off switch is the one on the LEFT, the mode switch is the one on the RIGHT. This is cumbersome if you are right handed. Also the HP10 had a large on/off switch mounted at the center of the headlamp which was easy to use. I feel the smaller on/off button on the HP11, combined with the bad placement makes operation more difficult than the HP10.- The battery holder is WORSE than the HP10, which had a ""clam-shell"" holder with protective seal that was FIRMLY secured by TWO thumbscrews. The HP11 has an annoying ""slide-out"" holder secured by a single screw. This screw must be tightened VERY tight to create a secure seal. On receiving this was so tight I couldn't unscrew this by hand and had to use a pair of pliers! If the screw must be tightened so tight to maintain a waterproof seal it is bad design! Also I find the slide-out holder to be annoying compared to the previous flip-open ""clam-shell"" holder.- The connecting cable between the battery holder & headlamp ""stick out"" and bend at approx 90 degree angles when the cable is inserted into the grooves on the clip-on wire guide (that clips onto the elastic headband). The problem with this is that it exposes the cable more than it should and it has a higher chance of snagging or damage due to flexing. The design should have had the cable exiting the headlamp and battery holder at 45 degree angles, which would keep the cable closer to the headband and reduce flexing.- The front half of the HP10 was metal (probably aluminum) which was good for dissipating heat from the LED. The HP11 seems to be entirely plastic construction which would be worse for heat dissipation.OVERALL the HP11 is NOT WORTH IT compared to the older model, especially at the price. I am disappointed in Fenix for producing a headlamp that is WORSE than the previous model.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9FIEYBTBJUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056HR4J2#wasThisHelpful","R3G9FIEYBTBJUZ","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LOGISYS PS550E12BK is a ATX form factor supply that is a good choice if you need a 6-pin 12V connector to power a graphics card that requires external power. I will be comparing this supply to the similar LOGISYS PS480E12 480W 120mm Ball Bearing Switching Power Supply (which does NOT have the 6-pin connector).CONNECTORS:20+4 ATX power connector2 x 4-pin motherboard 12V power connectors1 x 6-pin graphics card power4 x molex drive connectors2 x SATA power connectorsTHE GOOD:+ Has black textured (anti-fingerprint) case+ Has one dual ball bearing 120mm cooling fan (verified by the label of the fan itself). Ball bearing fans are a must in power supplies because a bad fan will cause the power supply to cook itself to failure shortly (if you don't notice that the fan has failed). A ball bearing fan has superior lifespan over the cheaper sleeve bearing fans that are used on most power supplies. Anyway, the fan in this supply has an RPM of 1600 and is not adjustable or temperature controlled.+ This supply also has dual 12V motherboard power connectors (the 4 pin one that plugs into the motherboard). As shipped it looks like a single 8-pin connector and so you might be confused that there is no 4-pin connector at first glance. However the two connectors combine into one, so if you only have a single 4-pin connector on your motherboard (like most boards) you need to separate the two connectors. Note that the similar PS480E12 supply does not have dual 12V connectors.+ 12V power rail is higher amperage (25A) than on similar priced PS480E12 supply (16A). This is primarily because of the 6-pin 12V graphics card power connector and the dual motherboard 12V power connectors. The PS550 is rated total average power 400W (Max Power 550W), but understand that PS manufacturers intentionally rate supplies with the highest  (i.e. unrealistic) wattage figure that they can advertise. Consider this a 400W supply despite the 550W rating. By comparison the PS480E12 is rated total average power 330W (Max Power 480W)+ Has nylon mesh sleeving to keep cabling tidy which is something the PS480E12 missed.+ Internally, this PS has AC line filtering components that are not in the PS480E12.THE BAD:- Has the same generic capacitors that are in the PS480E12. Time will tell whether these are quality caps. These are 1000uF caps, would have liked to see 1500uF or even 2200uF.- The internal heatsink is different from the PS480E12 - the fins do not extend to help with heat dissipation.- Some may dislike that there is no fancy LED fan (I don't care).OVERALL I would buy this supply over the PS480E12. As I write this it is actually slightly cheaper so it's an easy decision to recommend this power supply.I hope this has been useful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DILKDTUSAOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MU8VCS#wasThisHelpful","R25DILKDTUSAOB","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LOGISYS PS480E12 Power Supply is a standard ATX power supply and can be used to replace the power supplies in most generic/DIY built PCs. Note that there is no 6-pin video card power connector on this supply (some power hungry graphics cards require this connector) so if you need this check out the Logisys Corp. 550W 120mm Ball Bearing Fan with PSU ATX 550 Power Supply PS550E12BK, Black instead.THE GOOD:+ Has one dual ball bearing 120mm cooling fan (verified by the label of the fan itself). Ball bearing fans are a must in power supplies because a bad fan will cause the power supply to cook itself to failure shortly (if you don't notice that the fan has failed). A ball bearing fan has superior lifespan over the cheaper sleeve bearing fans that are used on most power supplies. Anyway, the fan in this supply has an RPM of 1600 and is not adjustable or temperature controlled. Note the difference in RPM compared to the specs on the product page (claimed 2000RPM but actually 1600RPM in my supply).+ Has physical on/off switch.THE BAD:- The wires to the Molex/floppy/SATA connectors are thinner compared to previous power supplies that I've used. Wire gauge appears to be 22 AWG.- There is no nylon sleeve on cables to keep wires neat and tidy. Because of this cabling is somewhat ""messy"" when installed (a couple of cable ties will help).- Some people may be disappointed that there are no fancy LEDs or that the case doesn't have shiny colors. (These things don't mean much to me anyway, I prefer a reliable plain-looking power supply over a fancy looking one).- I have examined the capacitors used on this supply. As expected they are some brand that I've never heard of - time will tell whether they actually last or not. However one thing that I didn't like is the low value of the capacitors on the DC outputs. This supply has single 1000uF caps on 3.3v, 5v & 12v outputs. Generally I would like to see 1500uF or preferably 2200uF. 1000uF was probably chosen because they are lower cost. One good thing about the caps is that they are not right next to the heatsink as in other supplies so they should not be affected by high temps.- Even though the supply is labelled ""480W"" note that the total average power is 330W (Max Power 480W).OVERALL, I would recommend this supply at the low cost (24 bucks at the time I bought it), although I wish it had sleeving to keep cables tidy. I have installed this supply in a PC that is on 24/7 and will update this review as time passes.I hope you have found this helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XVRDIAP92BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y56MTE#wasThisHelpful","R37XVRDIAP92BF","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ASW308 is an inexpensive 8-port 10/100Mbit Ethernet desktop/wall-mountable ""green"" switch.THE GOOD:+ Inexpensive.+ Compact attractive design.+ Uses Realtek RTL8309E chipset which is a highly integrated switch controller with built-in RAM etc for a more reliable & inexpensive switch.+ Documentation is better than expected for a switch. (I have noticed that AirLink's packaging and documentation seems to be better than the usual OEM). Anyway, a switch is something most people just plug in and never look at the documentation!+ Switch is a ""green"" switch, it saves power by powering down unused ports and dynamically adjusting power for shorter cable lengths.THE BAD:- If you need a Gigabit switch this is not for you (10/100Mbit only). It will of course work with other Gigabit devices but at reduced 100Mbit speed. I recommend the TRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps) if you need a Gigabit switch.- No screws included for wall mounting. Additionally the screw holes underneath do not have the height clearance to fit commonly available pan head #6 screws (They should have made the case screw recessed holes a bit taller).- The markings on the case do not indicate the voltage of the power adapter, in case you get it mixed up with other adapters (or are trying to find a replacement). It's 8VDC @ 0.6 amp, center pin positive. Also note that the power adapter plugs into the right side of the case so you will need some space around that side of the case.OVERALL I would recommend this switch - it is a good value for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R299CF39ORMSJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IPJX7S#wasThisHelpful","R299CF39ORMSJU","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DT-L3108HV DVR is a small 8-channel DVR (desk footprint slightly bigger than a 10"" netbook). It accepts one SATA 3.5"" hard drive (although the electronics look like it was designed to accommodate 2 drives since there is an unused SATA data connector on the board). Note that NO hard drive is included, this is a DIY addition. I have installed a 2TB drive and it works fine.THE GOOD:+ There is a front mounted USB port so when you want to backup to a USB drive you don't have to fumble at the back of the DVR (possibly disconnecting a cable).+ There is a single 40mm fan to cool the electronics & hard drive.+ The local DVR Interface (i.e. using the mouse) is polished, with slick menu icons. The only thing that's missing from the local DVR interface is an exit playback button (you have to right click then select stop playing, then view desktop to exit playback mode and resume live view)+ An interesting thing is that for the 9-view split (remember only 8 cams can be connected) the 9th view shows codec bitrate information for each channel which can be useful for understanding how different resolution/quality settings affect bitrate. This is something that I have not seen with other DVRs that I've used. However it would be useful if the DVR would average the last 30 seconds of video and display MByte/Hour statistic as well as the # of days of currently stored recorded video.+ The DVR interface does show the start/end dates of stored video (you have to dig in the menu options to find it)+ You can schedule periodic reboots.THE BAD:- Monitor output is only VGA, there is no HDMI output (you can also connect a ""spot"" monitor via BNC output connector but most people will not use this). Even though there's no HDMI support the GUI interface allows ""widescreen"" resolutions via VGA (up to 1440x900)- Case was a little harder to open/close than expected, you have to slightly bend the sides apart while raising/lowering the back of the case.- The printed documentation is atrocious, even by DVR OEM standards. There are no instructions on how to open the case, and the operation of the DVR isn't really covered in the sort of detail that I'd like. However by playing around you can probably figure out most things, but I would prefer to read an accurate manual to save time. There were also documentation files on the CD but my CD was defective (see further below) so I don't know if a better manual was on the CD.- Placement of video out (BNC) jack is right next to channel 1 input, if you are not careful you might plug a cam into this jack. There should have been clear visual separation of camera inputs from similar-looking connectors (or at the very least a label on the top of the DVR pointing this out).- Unlike most other DVRs the hard drive LED just remains ""on"" all the time, it doesn't blink to indicate activity.IMAGE QUALITY:+ Recorded playback quality is very good at D1 resolution and ""best"" quality. It is SUPERIOR to the Nightowl Zeus DVR that I have previously reviewed (which has a blocky mess of pixels for video playback)PC CLIENT (CMS) SOFTWARE:+ Software has good layout and options+ You can actually view live video while playing back a video file (each in different windows). This is both good & bad - both use bandwidth so if you only want to playback and don't care about live monitoring you should stop the live live (click on the cam icons to turn off) before playback. Many DVRs don't allow live monitoring while playing back.+ You can click on the video timeline to quickly jump around during playback.+ You can adjust DVR settings remotely via the client software.- Slow/Fast playback does not display an onscreen speed indicator ""2x, 4x, 8x"" etc like on other DVRs.- One negative thing is that Fast Forward sometimes causes playback to stop, especially at the higher fast forward playback speeds. When this happens you have to click stop then restart playback of the video file that you were watching (you don't have to close or restart the client software though). I have verified that this consistently happens even on a LAN connection, so it's nothing to do with internet bandwidth or transmission. This really should never happen for a DVR and is an unfortunate black mark against it. I have not tested the web-based (IE browser) software because I think the PC CMS software does everything needed for most remote access. The DVR also comes with mobile software for Android/Blackberry/Symbian & Windows Mobile devices (untested by me).- The miniCD that was included with the DVR was defective - I could not read the software from it and on visual inspection it had a bumpy defect on the data side. I downloaded the software from D&T's website at [...]BUILD CONSTRUCTION/INCLUDED ACCESSORIES:- Remote does not come with batteries. Some other DVRs include them.- There were a few solder splashes inside the case. I removed them but production staff is obviously not being careful enough - they could potentially cause damage to the internal electronics.- The plastic cover that covers the DVR's infrared remote sensor came out and was rolling around inside the case. I guess this was not glued down as it should be (this is a cosmetic issue, the remote will work without the cover in place)OVERALL, I would recommend this DVR, even though it's an 8 channel DVR. In terms of the last DVR I reviewed (16 channel Nightowl Zeus DVR) the DT-L3108HV has better image quality, a more usable interface, and is also smaller in size (although it only holds a single hard drive).UPDATE: There is one stupid design flaw - the clock is powered by a non-rechargeable battery that is SOLDERED-IN and not user replaceable! When it dies your clock will stop working as it is only powered by the battery (even if the DVR is on). It is unacceptable that the battery is not easily replaceable.I now recommend the following DVR model instead: 8Ch H.264 Onvif CCTV Hybrid DVR, D1 Realtime DVR, 1080P NVR with 3G, Wifi, HDMI Output CCTV Security Systems as it is an updated version that has 960H camera support, newer firmware, a user-replaceable battery and can work with either analog cameras or certain IP cameras (for better quality images). The software and user interface is virtually the same as on the DNT.I hope you have found this review useful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPUK2TNR38DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042KYU3M#wasThisHelpful","R3CPUK2TNR38DI","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I purchased the Zeus DVR model with the factory installed 500GB SATA hard drive. Apart from the hard drive difference there is no functionality difference, thus I am reviewing this DVR here.THE GOOD:+ DVR can record D1 resolution on all channels, approx 7 Frames Per Second on each channel.+ DVR can accommodate 2 drives.+ DVR has 2 fans help cool the internals, especially the drives.+ Has HDMI output in addition to VGA, so you can easily connect to a large TV or monitor.

Very blocky video playback!PLAYBACK COMMENTS:- Local Playback options (i.e. you are at the DVR using the USB mouse) is very limited and cumbersome. To playback you first select a channel, then calender date, then click search, then click on a time (in half hour increments). Then you select which channels to playback (default is all 16, and if you don't want this you have to click on each channel to deselect). Finally the video starts playing but you have to go thru the whole painful process again if you want a different time. There are no controls while playing to easily jump to a specific time or a ""timeline"" that you could easily jump around while playing.- I just mentioned it but will do so again: You can only select time in half hour increments while doing local playback at the DVR.Local playback is retarded and cumbersome but I was hoping that the PC Client software would make up for this. It's better than the local DVR interface but has issues as well. (I used the latest DVR firmware and client software at the time of this review)PC CLIENT PLAYBACK:- For playback you cannot full screen a video file, even though you could do this if viewing ""live"" video.- When playing back there is no ""Snapshot"" feature, even though there is one for ""live"" view.+ One ""plus"" is that you can click on the timeline of a playing video file and you can jump to various times.- You can't setup the client software to autologin (i.e. without entering login details like username, password etc). Some DVR client software allows this and it can be convenient.- For some strange reason there is a ""bandwidth control"" that appears ONLY in the PC client software Remote Setting but not locally at the DVR itself using the local interface. So if you don't use the PC client software you'd never know it was there!- You cannot group cams to view remotely - either view all cams or manually click on each cam to start/stop playback.OVERALL, I DON'T RECOMMEND this DVR - the interface flaws and poor design really make using it a chore. It's a pity because the manuals/specs/client software/firmware is available online, which is not the case for many DVRs. It's a shame, with a little reworking of both the DVR firmware and client software this could have been a great DVR.

"For those that don't know Sony's Effio chipset has adjustable on-screen (OSD) controls for adjusting picture details as well as special functions (privacy mask, lens iris adjustments, adjusting day/night trip point, turning Wide Dynamic Range on/off etc). This camera might indeed use the Effio chipset but does NOT have the controls molded into the cable as other Effio cams do. Therefore you are limited to whatever ""defaults"" the manufacturer programmed (and there's no way of knowing what these are).THE GOOD:+ Attractive, lightweight (due to black plastic case).+ Lots of IR LEDs for night vision.+ Comes with power supply.THE BAD:- Not fully adjustable as other Effio cams for the reason pointed out above.- This is not a varifocal cam, you cannot adjust lens to match your desired view - it's a fixed 3.6mm (wide angle) lens.- The seller has used the same amazon product ASIN for different products at different points in time.

Some might prefer that there was a PCIe x1 connector instead of one of the PCI slots.- Network is 10/100Mbit via a Realtek RTL8201CL (no Gigabit Ethernet on this board).- There does not seem to be any updated BIOS other than what the board ships with. Biostar's website does not list newer BIOS for this board other than one uploaded on 2010-08-26.OVERALL, I would recommend this board if you need to build a cheap system for general use or for a family member doing ""typical"" computer use (Office, Web browsing, etc). A cheap single-core CPU that works on this board is the AMD Sempron 145 Processor (SDX145HBGMBOX)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKD338ELAAC1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6W56A#wasThisHelpful","RKD338ELAAC1A","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am experienced with microcontroller systems but new to Arduino. Here's what I think of this book:THE GOOD:+ For a beginner it's very readable and isn't ""here's a bunch of theory and then we do fun stuff"". The book is very much hands-on oriented, giving just enough explanation related to the task at hand (which is both good & bad, more on this below)+ Book is thin and small, will not cause ""I have to read and understand all that?"" anxiety for beginnersTHE BAD:- The use of timer interrupts is not discussed at all in this book. I found this disappointing as timer interrupts are a common way to handle ""background"" tasks (this is where you can run code at specific time intervals). One could argue that this is not a beginner topic but since pin interrupt-on-change interrupts ARE discussed I think timer interrupts should have been as well. UPDATE: The follow-up book Programming Arduino Next Steps: Going Further with Sketches (Tab) covers timer interrupts and other fun stuff.- There are many issues that could be expanded on, even a couple of sentences would be helpful. Examples include:Arduino maximum pin current sink/source & applied voltage limitations. This is briefly mentioned in Chapter 1, but the author just mentions to be careful to not exceed the 40mA current limitation. He should have also mentioned that you can damage the chip this way (also if you exceed max voltage to an I/O pin). This should have been repeated in Chapter 6 which deals with digital interfacing. One of the most common mistakes in interfacing is overlooking the max operating specifications and damaging the chip or decreasing long-term reliability.In Chapter 10 where the author discusses Ethernet shields he mentions that you need the ""official"" shield based on the Wiznet chipset rather than the cheaper ones based on the Microchip ENC28F60 chip. He could have stated why - the reason is because the Wiznet chip handles the gory details of TCP/IP communication for you (and is more expensive than the ENC28J60 which requires the host chip to do the TCP/IP processing, which is NOT suitable for beginners).OVERALL, it's a gentle introduction for beginners to Arduino. If you are new to Arduino I would recommend buying an extra board or chip in case you accidentally damage it. It can be helpful for troubleshooting to try the same code on a different board to see if the problem might be with the board. Also, search the internet for ""10 Ways to Destroy an Arduino"" to avoid expensive mistakes.As a bonus, here are other useful Arduino-related items that I have reviewed/purchased and you might be interested in:Cheap UNO clone: SainSmart UNO R3 ATmega328P Development Board + USB Cable Compatible With Arduino UNO R3 Mega 2560 Nano RobotCheap Mega2560 clone: SainSmart Mega2560 R3 ATmega2560-16AU + ATMEGA16U2 + USB Cable for Robot Arduino UNO MEGA2560 R3 Duemilanove 2013Serial 2x16 LCD using I2C (only 2 I/O pins): ZITRADES New IIC/I2C/TWI 1602 Serial LCD Module Display For Arduino BY ZITRADESCheap Ethernet Shield: RioRand (TM) Upgraded Ethernet Shield W5100 for Arduino UNO R3 & MEGA 2560 DuemilanoveI hope you found this useful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIXAU1LLP34D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071784225#wasThisHelpful","RMIXAU1LLP34D","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm reviewing TV-IP110WN Hardware version 2. This is a 802.11n/wired Ethernet camera with no night vision capability.THE GOOD:+ Supports 802.11n+ InexpensiveTHE BAD:- Images have a lot of motion blur to them (in good light). For some reason other Trendnet cams that I've used don't exhibit this problem. I find this motion blur unacceptable. I do not know if this is something new to TV-IP110WN version 2 or if it was also present in version 1.- Frame rate is only adjustable in 5FPS intervals (5FPS, 10FPS, 15FPS, etc)- Only MJPEG compression is supported (no MPEG4 or H.264)OVERALL this camera feels like a cheap imitation of a Trendnet camera - I guess they have to cut corners and make them cheap to sell at this price? Unfortunately due to the motion blur I can't recommend this camera. Instead you might want to check out others which I have reviewed:TRENDnet TV-IP602WN ProView Wireless Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance CameraTRENDnet TV-IP312WN SecureView Wireless N Day/Night Internet Surveillance Camera Server with 2-Way AudioCisco-Linksys Wireless-N Internet Home Monitoring CameraLoftek Newest CXS 3200 Wireless/wired Pan:340&,<,ir Cut, Dual Audio Alarm Ip Camera,8-10 Meter Night Vision ,67 Viewing Angle,easy Installation.white(replace 2200)I hope you found this useful!","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4IYQ0R0AXFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UBSHQO#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4IYQ0R0AXFK","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CXS3200 is a Pan/Tilt indoor cam with nighttime infrared LEDs. Interfaces are 10/100 Mbit Ethernet & 802.11b/g WiFi (note no N!)THE GOOD:+ Inexpensive for a Pan/Tilt cam with IR capability, cheaper than ""brand name"" cams.+ Very quiet Pan/Tilt movement.+ Cam has IR LEDs for night vision. Also supposedly features a true IR filter for correct outdoor colors in daytime. (But remember this is an indoor camera only).+ Max resolution is 640x480, using MJPEG compression only (no MPEG4 or H.264)+ I like the bracket included with this camera, it is easy to install and adjust. You can even compensate for different bracket mounting angles which is nice. (Related to mounting is the firmware ability to flip and/or mirror the image, useful if the camera is mounted upside down)THE BAD:- Wifi is 802.11b/g NOT N. I'd recommend that you only consider this as a wired cam, especially since only MJPEG compression is available.- Firmware is missing some useful features. For example there does not seem to be a way to set preset P/T position for quick and easy position presets (where the cam moves to with a click of a button). Because of this you cannot set a certain position that the cam will ""powerup"" to. This is a big disadvantage in my book and is a feature in Trendnet PTZ cams that I like.- Frame rate appears to reset to default 30FPS after a power failure or reset. (Other cams retain the setting).- Also in contrast to other cams (Trendnet, Linksys etc) the setup interface feels almost like a prototype and is unpolished. At first glance you might miss additional option pages that are on the right side of the page, as opposed to the left side.- Like the Trendnet TV-IP110WN this camera has a problem with motion blur. Moderately fast motion will blur. I suspect the cam has a fixed (long) shutter speed.- At time of writing this there are no firmware updates on Loftek's website.NOT TESTED BY ME: Whatever software that comes with the camera (since I'm using BlueIris). Also I didn't test camera functions like emailing photos, FTP uploads, etc.OVERALL, it is an inexpensive camera without many bells or whistles. I doubt you will find a Day/Night Pan/Tilt camera for much cheaper. (I deducted one star for no 802.11n, one star for motion blurring, and one star for no preset positions and the ability to powerup to a preset position). You may also want to check out my review of the TRENDnet TV-IP602WN ProView Wireless Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance Camera for another Pan/Tilt cam.I hope you found this useful!","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUN8H397ELOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C32Q8O#wasThisHelpful","R3UUN8H397ELOG","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gigabyte GT440 GV-N44D3-1GI is a Nvidia GT440 powered card with 1GB of DDR3 memory.THE GOOD:+ Card doesn't require external power.+ Card has a nice large 80mm fan to cool heatsink. This fan is a 3-pin fan so the card can sense the fan RPM speed. (This is good as some cheaper graphics cards tend to use a 2-pin fan without the RPM feedback so the card has no way of knowing if the fan is working. I have fried a card or two because of this problem and I'm guessing I'm not the only one). I like the large fan on this card, in my experience larger fans are more reliable than smaller ones.+ Card has VGA, DVI, & HDMI ports. If your monitor has a VGA connector you wouldn't need a DVI>VGA adapter.+ Card delivers good performance for the price. This would be a good card to upgrade to if your graphics card is old (Note this is a PCI Express card, not AGP)THE BAD:- Because of the large heatsink/fan, the card blocks the expansion slot adjacent to this card. This is pretty much the norm for most graphics cards. Some cards have a ""double wide"" expansion slot bracket (which I don't like) but this one doesn't.- This particular model has 1GB of DDR3 memory. There is another model that has 512MB/GDDR5 memory which is faster. However if you're upgrading this will most likely be faster than your old card so it's not a big deal.- Card is not low-profile and cannot be used for LP systems/cases.- Unlike most new cards, the box is NOT shrinkwrapped! This made me a little uneasy but I bought 2 cards and both boxes were the same, no shrink wrap present.OVERALL, I would recommend this card, especially for upgrading. It is not a high end card, but the price isn't high end either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HH4ZB0MH5Z8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MF4IBQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HH4ZB0MH5Z8G","A2ROZACRW31PC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROZACRW31PC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are amazing scissors and not for the faint of heart. They are like the machete of scissors, and need to be in harms way to fully appreciate their features. Which just happen to include:1) powerful serrated blades that will slice coins in half or anything else you can fit in their mouth.2) a ring cutter that works and doesn't grind the gold or silver into powder like twist-ring-cutters.3) foldable design for smaller storage.4) carbide glass breaker for aggressive entry.5) foldable seatbelt/cord cutter hook.6) hardcore sheath that mostly works.But on the downside, several things are apparent including:1) the sheath is not user friendly meaning inserting and deploying the Raptors is clunker than it needs to be.2) the Raptors cannot be inserted in to the sheath with the cutting hook deployed. WTF?3) the fixed carbide glass breaker causes occasional palm punctures when prying or pushing on the scissors.4) the sheath seems to hold them backwards for most of my deployment where my thumb ends up in the wrong hole.5) and finally, what's with the black?

"Nice light but has quite a spot component to it. I also have the 12v Milwaukee LED light and two things surface. 1) the Milwaukee is much better as a work light since a spot light is more like a flashlight. And 2) the Dewalt has a much better form factor and features that really work. The magnet on the Milwaukee barely holds it still, and it's shape prevents it from pointing easily in many directions.In a nutshell, I'd say the dewalt is more of a every-day light especially when not doing tool work, and the Milwaukee is an excellent wide spectrum work light. If I was plumbing, doing electrical or digging around in a hole or chimney, I would use the Milwaukee hands down. If I want to know whats going bump in the night or what's crawling around the back yard, then definitely the Dewalt.Really, the Milwaukee produces a beautiful wide spot-free distribution of light.

"5 stars because it does exactly what it should as it should. However I also have the Rainier Arms Raptor Ambidextrous Charging Handle - .223 / 5.56mm and like it better.The Troy is an update of the traditional design, while the Raptor is a total re-engineered handle. The paddles in the Troy roughly mirror each other while the Raptor paddles are side-specific and have beefed up pins rather than the tried-and-true pins in the Troy.Both are necessary upgrades IMHO, but for roughly the same price, the RA Raptor is the better choice. When one closes in on a Benji for a simple Al charging handle, it better be golden. Also-rans don't turn me on.

I don't know if you'll ever need to, but most of my other Benchmades have this ability, and it is massively handy.Of course, Benchmade offers a cleaning, tightening and sharpening service for only $5, or free (you pay the one-way shipping) if the knife seems to require warranty service due to loosening.No matter what, this knife is a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQ3AM3MW19FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036K0HWW#wasThisHelpful","R1GQ3AM3MW19FW","A1FXT4VNDA25LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FXT4VNDA25LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, as a Gold Ring Leupold scope, this little fellow is top shelf all the way. The optics and operation make it a joy to use all day long. Absolutely no hesitations there.But the size is what you need to be aware of. Not that there is anything wrong with the size, but instead is this the size you need?  Some other reviewers seem to have been expecting something else than the world's finest compact spotting scope.Where this scope is ideal is when you need 1. World-class optics, 2. extreme light weight in a spotting scope, 3. a 10x-20x range, 4. reasonable but not exceptional low light capability, 5. ability to easily handhold the scope, and 6. you are looking for a binocular supplement, not a binocular replacement.The Gold Ring 10x20 compact spotting scope is not for everyone. It is like the Macbook Air of laptops. Truly amazing, but with limits. However, it is those limits that allow it to be truly amazing.The major difference between this scope and its larger brethren is that you will have this scope with you. You will bother to set it up. And you will bother to bring it along no matter where you go. It doesn't matter how nice or big a scope you have. If you don't bring it with you or pull it from its case, then you might as well not have a scope.Normally compact spotting scopes are substandard designs, optics, and focus. Further, many of those junk compacts have the physics to go to 60x but have no where near the optics to pull off such a stunt. In this case, the Leupold 10-20x Compact flawlessly presents the world every time and across its entire zoom range. No corners cut here.If you need/want something in this form factor, this is the scope to get. If you need something that reaches out to 60x, look elsewhere. And also hire a sherpa to carry it. Oh, and don't say I didn't warn you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBX6P1862ILW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HN5GHQ#wasThisHelpful","RBX6P1862ILW7","A1FXT4VNDA25LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FXT4VNDA25LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Standup Paddle Board (SUP) fishing is the next big things, and this pack is perfect.Wearing it like a sling keeps the right hand more free to throw a line or paddle. The sling does not have an attachment point on the right side near the waist.The main pocket is larger enough for a lunch, jacket, tackle, and some other EDC odds and ends. Where this kid rocks is that, compared to a backpack, the sling allows you so slide the pack from back to belly where the zipper awaits you. If you wore it on the opposite shoulder, the zippers would be on the bottom, so this essentially a right handed pack if you want all the benefits.It will keep your stuff dry if you fall off your board and get back on reasonably soon. The zippers are the water resistant kind that are easier to zip/unzip, but not hard like those of waterproof duffles, etc.Honesty, I think it could use a few more external attachment points, but not a big deal.The waist belt is quite nice, but a little overkill given the single lightly padded shoulder strap.Another side note: this can ride higher on your back if you want allowing for a CO2 inflatable PFD to be worn around the waist. And the shoulder strap has a small release buckle on at the waist contact point allowing you to dump it quickly...if you can manage to pinch the sides of the buckle.

"is that Fishpond went back to the drawing board with no traditions to uphold. From the standpoint of universal design and effective human/machine interaction, the Pitchfork scores big time. The large finger holes provide plenty of grip even if hands are cold or gloved.The cutting surfaces provide a snip exactly where you want it, not almost where you want it. The eye cleaner is stellar and near impossible to poke anything but what you want. I would have said impossible, but someone out there will manage to puncture their waders with it no matter where it is.And of course, there is the coolness factor. In this case its two-fold. First, it looks great. Second, it feels great to work with. Given the clipper is one of the most used fishing tools, why not add some class and tool-apprecation to your vest.So for the cost of a few lattes you can move up from your fingernail cutters to a precision instrument that would be home in a surgical theater as well as a blue ribbon stream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEI3TC76NYJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KM4VPS#wasThisHelpful","R3PEI3TC76NYJZ","A1FXT4VNDA25LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FXT4VNDA25LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Normally the charging handle blends into the background working day in and day out with no issues. So why mess with success? Because sometime even successful designs need help.Most operators are range bunnies who never push the limits of their gear. However, when things go south in an hurry, the charging handle moves front and center as the only way to move a round into battery, for working through a jam, and cycling the most important workings of the rifle.The design of the Raptor gives you the best chance for successful operation regardless of hand, palm, or stump operation. There are two critical levers that can not fail: the charging handle and the trigger. If your not pulling on one, then you're pulling on the other.Further the durability factor is important when cycling the action with whatever you have to work with. Things break. And they break faster when you are not careful. And if you need to be careful with it, then you need to leave ""it"" in the safe.For those choking on the price, think of it as only $50 more than a basic charging handle, and only $10 more than a BCM GUNFIGHTER Ambidextrous Charging Handle (5.56mm/.223) w/ Mod A44 (Ambi).So toss down the extra ten and move to the top of the food chain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WY3WIZ44H02G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KMH3M2#wasThisHelpful","R2WY3WIZ44H02G","A1FXT4VNDA25LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FXT4VNDA25LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Patriots was a mostly fun but occasionally tedious ride through one vision of the ""Crunch."" From what I understand, it was written as a survival field manual but in novel or storytelling form. While more entertaining than a field manual, it did require the tidbits of potential wisdom to be mined from a mildly shortsighted and narrow minded narrative. I'm sure the author would disagree, but given that the book folds over many years, few contributions are given to society at large by the main characters except some murderous assaults on evil gangs (of which the ""good"" shooters gloated a little too much given that they just killed a bunch of people based upon reports by others. Essentially the distopian justice dolled out by the book's heroes really provides a strong foothold for a future dictatorship in sheep's clothing.I certainly won't fault the author for trying to teach important skills while entertaining the audience, but there is actually an even better but intended message here that should be taken to heart: if there ever is a crunch event of some sort, the mindset of many will parallel that of the leaders in Patriots. Distilled, this means that there will be plenty of holier-then-thous running around dressed in camo and shooting those deemed less worthy--then grinning afterwards because they just scored more brownie points with their particular version of the afterlife.Luckily, the simplicity of the story and the writer's endless distraction with guns and acronyms has opened the window into viewing others who survived but have carved out much more noble and useful niches in the post-society. And while the major characters of the book are busy patting themselves on the back, others in the neighborhood are likely avoiding the ""patriots"" due to their penchant toward extreme violence, paranoia, and a deeply engrained attitude of shoot first and skip the questions.The highlighted militia followed in the book started the journey with quality preparedness, but post-event, they quickly devolved into self-anointed apostles who can kill without remorse, steal with justification (leaving useless cash is the same as stealing even if it does make the their feel better), and pretend to follow Jesus.So the take-aways of this book are really found in the vignettes and cameos we get from other non-militia survivors who run farms, show up at the barter fairs, and appear here and there along the countryside for it is within those other voices that we readers realize that the violent gun-worshiping ""patriots"" are actually a fungus that grows on the fringes of society and must be overcome or pacified before America can get back to business.Perhaps the characters in Patriots would be better served by reading a few history books rather than working on their CQB skills. Rawles makes it clear that there will always be plenty of room for mistrust, conspiracy theory even if there is no evidence, no facts, and no names attached to the so-called information.By the time the book fizzles out, it is clear that America can only survive if it models Germany in the 1920s. Huh? you ask. That's my point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O3H5WNBO1FQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ODHO8G#wasThisHelpful","R2O3H5WNBO1FQO","A1FXT4VNDA25LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FXT4VNDA25LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sure you can carry spare parts, but think about it, what spare bike parts do you carry beyond a tube or two?On the ride side, this trailer tracks like it's on rails.

"It's 1968 in this crime novel. Sam McCain is a lawyer that moonlights as a PI to pick up some extra cash. He's called out to a hippie commune outside Black River Falls, Iowa by the leader, Richard Donovan, for a matter he couldn't talk about over the phone. Sam had represented the commune a number of times in court(the sheriff was a bigot in addition to being incompetent and just plain stupid; not mention a nemesis of Sam's).He's shown a body in the barn, a young woman, the daughter of one of the richest men in town and he knows a s*** storm will hit the commune over this one. Everyone is sure who the killer is, Neil Cameron,a young man who had fallen for the young woman, a tease among the young folk of the town, and been rebuffed. A Viet Nam vet who came back a broken man over something that happened over there.Sam doesn't believe he did it, which puts him in the middle of opposing sides, as usual, as he continues to investigate the killing, and the others that come, much to the displeasure of the father, the sheriff, the folks who hate the commune(one completely nutty local radio preacher comes to mind).This was a good that is scheduled for release in October","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ET6CSL0RBZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605982601#wasThisHelpful","R34ET6CSL0RBZT","A391VTDTFIM6X3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A391VTDTFIM6X3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a biologist. And I have a young daughter. I'd like to foster her interest in the natural world, and help her learn about the things around her. Including little things, like insects. This set is a good way to go about that. The bug vacuum isn't super powerful (I don't see any risk of danger), but strong enough to actually pick things up, including small to medium sized insects, without harming them. The switch that flips the door (magnifying glass) down on the chamber works well. Things won't escape until you want them to. It is a terrible magnifying glass however. Most kid toy ones are. I'd suggest a better one eventually, but this one isn't too bad to start with.The critter barn isn't bad either. It's a basic container for insects, or other small animals. It has a light, a built-in magnifier (low quality). The lid is easy to get on and off, which is good, because the little door thing might work to get things in, but out would be more difficult.An alternative to a set like this for older children might be getting actual entomology (insect study) equipment from a company like Bioquip, the same company scientists (like myself) order from directly to study small animals. For about the same amount of money, you could get a decent insect net, some vials, and equipment to start making a small insect collection.And whatever you do, don't forget a field guide. If you're going to have small critters in hand (or in a container), it's a very good idea to have a way to identify and learn about them. My favorite resource is currently the National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Insects and Spiders & Related Species of North America. It's absolutely fantastic, and far better than the A Field Guide to Insects: America North of Mexico, Kaufman Field Guide to Insects of North America (Kaufman Field Guides), or National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders (National Audubon Society Field Guides). None of those are terrible, but the NWF guide is better, for all ages (plenty of pictures).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAU8HB11CBD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUS460C#wasThisHelpful","RAAU8HB11CBD1","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This replaced an older Onkyo receiver that had a few issues, and didn't work like it should anymore. The first thing I noticed is that this one was significantly lighter in weight. That may not be a good sign, I always heard that heavy audio equipment meant quality components. I'm going to give Pioneer a pass on this and assume that maybe newer technology can be lighter without sacrificing quality. Maybe.I do wish this were a 7.1 or 7.2 unit rather than 5.2. My older receiver was a 7.2, which allowed me to bi-amp the front speakers in my 5.1 setup. Can't do that with this one. The sound quality is still fantastic though. I don't know for sure whether it's better than the Onkyo receiver I had, but it's certainly not any worse. I'm getting very good sound from this unit through my Polk speakers.Setup was as simple as these units can be. I tried out the setup app than can be used with the unit, and it walked me through the process easily enough. The only printed manual that came with the unit was a quick setup guide. It was helpful, I suppose, but limited. The receiver also came with a CD with the official user manual on it. I hate that. I would strongly have preferred a printed user manual rather than a file on out-of-date technology. Haven't bothered with the CD yet, and probably never will, unless I have a problem.The on-TV-screen menu system could use work. It looks terrible (graphics quality), but does what it needs to, I guess. Not quite as much customizability there as I would have hoped, so I may need to actually track down that user manual some day for some advanced features, but the receiver is giving me good sound when I want it to, for movies, TV shows, and listening to the (FM) radio. Which I guess is all I need it for. I may try out some of the more advanced features soon, I'll update my review if/when I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KRINELSCIVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V84S1PS#wasThisHelpful","R19KRINELSCIVL","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked the idea of the game, but the implementation falls short in several areas. The dough is crumbly, and sticks to my carpet and the inside of the game box far better than the boards it is designed to be used with. It is also difficult to get out of the non-flexible fish molds, making it a frustrating experience.Game play is pretty straightforward, and easy  enough for children old enough to get it.

"I like this game. I'm a biologist, and I know a lot of animal nerds. Among this crowd, the game works. But for those with only a mild interest in the natural history of some of the greatest creatures on the planet... well, the game's weaknesses start to show. It's not fast paced, and not particularly fun. It doesn't have the playability of Settlers, and this isn't a game you're likely to come back to again and again once you've got the cards memorized. Cards Against Humanity is a different game each time, but this really isn't.Ideal audience: nature geeks, including and especially children.

"This is my fourth Android device, and the only one of the four that I want to use ever again. The other three (one phone, two tablets) have all become frustratingly slow. This G4 blows them all away. The screen is big enough that I don't miss using my tablets (7 and 8""). It's larger than my other phone, but still fits in my pocket just fine, and is an excellent size. The resolution is amazing, and everything displayed on the device is sharp and crisp, with plenty of detail. Colors are good. Perhaps a bit oversaturated, but vibrant and good-looking (I'm a professional photographer, so this is important to me). And there's no lag at all when using the phone. Since this is the flagship device from a major phone manufacturer, it has everything: dual cameras (and nice ones at that), flashlight, scratch-resistant glass (slightly inwardly curved, too), auto-dimming screen, excellent audio quality, advanced bluetooth features, dual band WiFi, etc.My only cons:I wish this phone came with a manual. There were no instructions in the box besides a little quickstart sheet, which wasn't very helpful. I guess that's why I have Google. Still... some features are not intuitive, like how to shoot raw images with the phone. Still need to figure that out.The charger is shaped a bit weird. Sticks out farther than I'd like from the plug. And it's white. I'd prefer black.I have the leather version, and while I like it now (looks great, and it's reasonably 'grippy'), I'm not sure I'd choose that one. The stitching isn't likely to last indefinitely with moderate use, and it's less cleanable than other options. It is nicely made, though.Anyway, this is clearly one of the very best phones available right now, if you can afford it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R89O76UTE2O8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMGSDRQ#wasThisHelpful","R89O76UTE2O8E","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to review a product like this. What I can say is that I like the product packaging. The long neck on the bottle makes the additive fairly easy to get into the engine. I wish there were a better way of measuring, since I didn't have to add the whole bottle at one oil change. There are no measurement markings on the bottle at all.Did I notice a difference in the way my engine ran, or sounded? Nope. Am I 100% convinced that a stabilizer like this one is necessary (or even helpful)? Nope. There is evidence that oil additives beyond those already in the oil itself might do more harm than good, as another reviewer pointed out.

"Like most Perky-Pet products, this item doesn't feel like it's built all that well. Good enough, but cheap. I don't expect it to last forever. But it does what it should: sticks to my window, holds seed (black oil sunflower is the best general choice for most birds), and... well... it's clear? That's about it. There was a little bit of ""assembly"" required snapping in the feeding ports, but it took less than a minute, and the instructions were pretty clear. I made sure to clean my window and the included cheap-feeling suction cups well before installation, and that part went fine. The suctions cups seem to support the weight of feeder, plus seed, plus visiting birds, so they're good enough for now. It did take birds a while to find it, but that's based on placement location, and is to be expected of any feeder. I also have the Birdscapes Clear Window Feeder 348, and think I like this one better, as the main body of the feeder slides out and away from the window for easier filling. That Birdscapes one is much tougher to remove for filling, and is intended to be filled in place, which isn't as easy.Anyway, it works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1S48LTE6QB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8R2SOA#wasThisHelpful","R3J1S48LTE6QB6","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would not think highly of an educational anatomy toy that did not properly display human anatomy. If you feel that children should not be exposed to facts and reality (and their own body parts), then I would suggest you re-evaluate your own beliefs, not these items.The magnetic part on each layer is thin, and not very good. Layers do not stick to each other well. And the thin tagboard used to make most of the layers isn't exactly 'wood'.

"At twenty bucks a piece, this is not your cheapest cloth diapering option, but it's certainly a good one. This diaper is about as adjustable in size as they come, but that doesn't mean it'll work for your tiny newborn. For the smallest kids, I'd suggest a smaller diaper, like the Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop,Size 1, or something else small that doesn't tell you it'll fit all kids.This is my first all-in-one for my daughter. Most cloth diapering I've done has been with a separate diaper cover and a diaper insert (I love the OsoCozy Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, in both sizes). This one saves a step, but is a bit less customizable (I typically use a smaller insert during the day, and a thicker one at night, for instance). You can still add another insert with the one already attached to this diaper, but it's already fairly bulky.The velcro used is good, but I do prefer snap closures, which I think tend to last longer and attach more securely.Stitching, materials, and everything else is nice. Definitely a step up in quality (and price) from the chinese diapers I've stocked up on from that big auction site. A good choice, if you like the all-in-one design, prefer velcro over a snap closure, and have enough money to get a sufficient quantity of these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPACM238I1QF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLRI5BE#wasThisHelpful","RPACM238I1QF4","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had an older-model Kitchenaid classic for a few years that gets somewhat regular use, and this has more than replaced it. Honestly, the mixer part is about the same, though I think the Kenwood has a better/stronger motor. Where this unit really shines is the all-in-one performance it gives. The mixer is great. The blender is great. The food processor is great. And the whole package takes up only the space of the mixing unit, it's not really any bigger than my Kitchenaid mixer.Build quality is solid, everything feels well made. The two small changes I might want, and where Kitchenaid still has an advantage over it, are the following: I wish the handle on the mixing bowl were more useful, and vertically-oriented like the new Kitchenaid bowls. Also, the design of the Kitchenaid splash guard thing allows it to be removed without removing the attachment in use, while with this one, that isn't possible. Could lead to a messy situation if it needs to be removed in the middle of a project.Oh, and when they say not to store mixer attachments in the bowl, they really mean it. I forgot I had them in there while testing out the food processor, and since the mixer spins at the same time, it really mangled the whisk, and scraped some metal off of the bowl itself. Oops. Not sure whether I should count that as a strike against the product or not. It was my fault, but it would be nice if the other parts of the device were disengaged when you were using a different one.Still... overall, the product is great, and a welcome addition to my kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Q9PN6GEVJ0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYFICRO#wasThisHelpful","R30Q9PN6GEVJ0G","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this is the thinnest, worst magnetic sheet I've ever seen. Super thin. I guess that makes it easier for printers to handle (that part went fine), but it's barely sticking to my fridge, so I wouldn't recommend it. Besides that, every sheet in the package (yes, all three of them) is significantly warped, so that individual business card magnets will not lie flat against a surface. Unprofessional, and not worth purchasing. My preferred solution: adhesive magnet sheets I got from a popular auction site that are pre-cut in business card size.

"This is my second mattress of this type. The first, a Signature Sleep Contour 8-Inch Mattress, Queen, is the one I sleep on. This new one, a twin, is for guest bed use and for my toddler as she outgrows her smaller bed.Pluses:First, the fact that it's delivered to your home (in basically a large duffel bag, inside a huge box), and offers such a neat 'unwrapping' experience. Yeah, it's fun. The mattress quality is actually surprisingly good. The bed fluffs up without a problem, and it's not as wimpy or spongy as you might think. Actually, not at all. It's a mattress, and feels like one. This twin mattress is a significant step up from the cheap 'bunk bed' and discount store bargain mattresses. It's supportive, a decent weight, and feels great to lie down on, even for us normal-sized human beings. The wrapped coils are nice, and noticeable (in a good way... motion isolation).Minuses:Two things I can think of: one, like most mattresses (all?), it'll sag a bit over time. I don't think this style is worse than any other, but expect it to have a shallow depression after a few months to a year. Flipping and rotating the mattress will help with that. Also, due to the way these mattresses are packaged and delivered,the sides/edges cannot be reinforced like they are in some other nice mattresses. So, the edges have some 'give' to them, which you might feel when sitting on the edge. Not really a big deal, since you don't sleep on the very edge, and this particular mattress (unlike my queen mattress) has stronger, more supportive coils at the sides to deal with this issue, which is a plus for this one. This one also features respectable 13 gauge springs (my queen: 15 ga), which should help with both of these potential 'negatives'.Overall, I think it's a great mattress for the price. Yes, you could probably get something better if you were willing to shop around locally and pay FAR more, but in this price range, I'm not sure it can be beat for value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYRY4A4VJ2Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQIPLPU#wasThisHelpful","R3QYRY4A4VJ2Q7","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On a 7"" tablet, there's only one way the 5-unit toy can be placed on the screen (diagonally, across the whole thing). For younger kids, this will be thoroughly annoying, as it likely won't register correctly on the device.The toys don't always register correctly even when they are placed on the screen in an appropriate location. Multiple times, we had them come up as the wrong numbers, possibly because the entire surface of the toy didn't contact the electronic device simultaneously. Wanna teach your kids bad math? That'll do it.The apps are quite limited. I used two with my child: Tiggly Addventure, and Tiggly Cardtoons. Addventure has only two scenarios. Kids can play through both in about five minutes. Then what? Well... they can do the exact same thing again. Cardtoons is also limited, as each number (1 through 5) only has half a dozen or so 'cards' attached. Repetition will start popping up quickly. Yes, the apps are well designed, and have great graphics, but they get boring very quickly. The company should (and probably will) add more scenarios to its apps with updates.I found the apps far more fun and enjoyable when used in ""finger touch"" mode, without the toys completely.

"This is not a cheap trail mix. In fact, it's about the most expensive I've ever seen, and you can likely get something similar at your local grocery store for under half the price (yes, even for a premium mix). However, the ingredients are all organic, and are pretty good. The mix contains no funny chemicals, just things you'll recognize as food. Plus chocolate (not sure if that counts). Most trail mixes have a mix of salty and sweet, whereas this one is very light on the 'salty'. There is no added salt (besides what's in 'salted peanuts, one of the minor ingredients), and as a result, had a pretty low sodium content. I actually found that kind of a negative, personally. The mix is a bit bland without the added 'salty'. Likely pretty good for you though.Each bag is pretty small. 6 ounces isn't much, and will likely be consumed in a couple sittings if you're anything like me. It's a bit too pricey for me to actually purchase, but it's not a bad choice if you like coconut and 'tropical' mixes, need to buy things on Amazon, and have way more money than you know what to do with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18P6YG5GPKX1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNOB1BC#wasThisHelpful","R18P6YG5GPKX1Y","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They didn't even paint any lines on it to show proper alignment for opening/closing. It is not one simple motion to open/close the pole. It's about three separate (and not intuitive) actions.

"I do not understand the reviews complaining that a device that should be sharp is actually sharp. Grating = cutting, people! More like shaving, actually, and you don't want to grate with a dull tool, since it will behave just like a dull knife or razor will: tearing things up, cutting unevenly, and giving the user an unpredictable (and potentially dangerous) experience. While it may take some getting used to if you're used to a terrible grater stamped out of a flat sheet of metal rather than a nice one, you want it sharp. Just learn to handle the tool properly, and you won't cut yourself. If a grater isn't capable of cutting you, it probably isn't doing a very good job of its intended purpose either.Now, the grater itself: it's great. I usually find I only use one side of the four-sided graters, and having to wash the whole thing (including the inside) is a pain. This is much simpler. One grater. No 'inside' to try to clean. Nice and sharp, so it cuts well, with little resistance. The nonslip rubber handle and base (that you set on your table, plate, or other surface) work well. It's a decent size, but not too big. I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PN83XAWYCL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051T92AY#wasThisHelpful","R27PN83XAWYCL8","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was expecting something different. Something more like Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder or maybe The Art of Roughhousing. You know, a useful work of nonfiction presenting relevant information to parents to help their children.This book... wasn't those. The word ""meditation"" in the title should have clued me in. This book is short. And jumps around. It's the author's thoughts on life, the universe, and everything. Lots of little autobiographic stories. Yes, it does include a bit on how children should be allowed to engage in relatively unstructured, 'dangerous' forms of play. I liked that part. The author apparently even did a little research so she could throw a statistic or two in there. But most of the book was her part-poetic, part-biographical meditative ramblings, which I did not find very useful, or worthy of my time (which is saying a lot; this book is short, and a pretty quick read).I'm sure there was a point to this book.

"This book contains three of the four classic Sherlock Holmes novels, and none of the short stories. If you've never read these, this book would be a good place to start. A Study in Scarlet is the world's introduction to Holmes, and the Hound of the Baskervilles is perhaps the best-known work. They're in here. This particular book has a nice introduction to Sherlock Holmes by a Conan Doyle biographer, and a timeline of Doyle's life that is quite comprehensive.But what I'd rather review here is the book itself. It's perfect. I had heard of (but didn't have anything from) the ""Everyman's Library"". Basically, it's one publisher's goal to put all of the world's classic literature in the hands of ""everyman"". This publisher's series has been around over a hundred years now, and I have to say, this is probably the nicest book I have. Hardback, in cloth. A ribbon marker. Nice, acid-free paper, and a print binding that should easily last a hundred years. It's just very well made, and a beautiful thing to hold (and smell; yeah, I sniff books). It's a true reader's book.Sure, you can get other editions of Holmes, or any other book in the series, but I was genuinely impressed with the binding and construction of this one.I do kind of wish it had at least the one missing novel. There are other books out there that collect all of the Sherlock Holmes work together, including the stories.

"It's like a lab manual for The Secret. Pam Grout presents specific, concrete steps to take to prove to yourself that the 'law of attraction' works (though she uses other terms). Technically, this is yet *another* 'lab manual' for that, since her book E-Squared came first, and this one can be thought of as a sequel to that one. I hadn't read that one, and wish I did first. While E^3 can be read without having read E-squared, I wouldn't recommend it. That one sets the foundation. This one provides additional exercises.The exercises are fairly easy and straightforward. Each will have you looking for signs or manifesting something for a period of about three days. In my experience, what you get out of it will be a direct result of what you put into it. Signs follow those that believe. So at least try to suspend your skepticism. Technically, if you're still a skeptic, you shouldn't be reading this book. Start with one of those others.

"The author most definitely did a fantastic job at making this book useful to artists of all skill levels. Some of it is a bit much for a beginner (like myself), but this is definitely a resource you can grow into. It isn't really a ""how to paint"" book (though there is plenty of that, mostly broken down by style and subject matter). It also covers the types of acrylic paint out there, putting together a studio, what kinds of brushes (and other materials) to buy and why, how to package paintings for shipping, how to interact with galleries, title your works, and just about everything else. I might suggest you take a class or get another starter book if you haven't done this before. There isn't a bunch of handholding for those making their first strokes, but there's a ton of useful information at every other skill level.

"I like this assortment. It has just the things I use, and not too much I won't. Three pots (small, medium, and large), two skillets (small and medium), and a saute pan that can doubles as a large skillet as needed.Sizes are about right. The smaller pan and skillet work well when cooking for one. The largest sizes would probably work well for up to four people at a time or so, depending on the dish.Build quality is excellent. Nice, heavy construction. Don't see these things warping or failing mechanically any time soon. Also, they look fantastic. And the nonstick finish is the best I've used. Works really well.BUT...They're aluminum. Sure, it's a hard anodized aluminum, but it's my least favorite metal for cookware. Aluminum has been potentially linked to an early onset of Alzheimer's and is just not a healthy metal to be ingesting. That means absolutely *NO* metal utensils in or on these dishes (wood, silicone, or plastic only), and they will end up having a limited lifespan once the anodization wears off and the nonstick finish starts peeling.I've also used a very similar set (also by Kitchenaid) that I'd recommend instead. It's stainless steel, but almost identical otherwise in terms of what it includes, and was approximately the same price. While stainless steel won't have quite the same nonstick properties, metal utensils become okay, and the cookware WILL last forever, as there isn't a finish to 'wear off'.I also love cast iron. Unlike aluminum, ingesting small bits of iron from cookware is actually good for you, and properly treated/conditioned, gives almost as good of a nonstick finish as whatever was used on these products. And will also last forever.Anyway, if you're okay babying this set, it'll treat you well. Quality is good, and it looks fantastic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDWLBN7MI8MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJAC8A0#wasThisHelpful","RKDWLBN7MI8MX","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clearly inspired by Uno, the game play is nearly identical. Instead of numbers, this game uses short words, with an emphasis on the vowel sound.

The vowel sounds are color coded to aid the learning process.Anyway, it's simple, well put together, and a nice choice for those households with kids of the right age (4+ recommended, kids as young as 2 or three can use it as well if/when they're ready to learn). It says 2-8 players, but I really think 8 would be stretching it. 2-4 players would be about right.Note that if you end up liking the game, or want to start with the complete set (there are six different levels, this listing is only for the first one), there is currently a nice special on the product's web site.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFOHOURKXVRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAR2GAC#wasThisHelpful","R2NFOHOURKXVRK","A3V15SFD7918WZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V15SFD7918WZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd already had the post-Revolution and Victorian books in the ""Everyday Life"" series, and just bought the Westward Expansion/Civil War volume, so decided to buy the other two books in the series. This, the first, is, sadly, a bit tedious, and that's a shame, because there are facts here I'd never read anywhere else, such as that the Pilgrims had little experience in farming; or how the amount of land a colonist had in different parts of the country determined what type of fence you would build (incidentally, ""good fences make good neighbors"" was a truism: if you did not have your crops properly fenced in and cattle ate them, it was your fault, not the owner of the cattle). There is a continual emphasis on the colonists' use of wood from the plentiful forests, England having nearly been deforested by that time by the regular need for wood. One of the interesting points of discussion is how the traditions of English life changed, for instance, that in England farmers lived in the village and walked to their fields every day; once in the United States they moved their homes to their fields.

"I admit, I was a little taken aback by some of the reviews for this book. People were very upset that Birdsall had moved up the Penderwick family timeline, and then included a very strong, troubling plotline halfway through the story. But as I settled into the book, I found that the time progression had not spoilt the storytelling nor the characters.Batty, the youngest ""original Penderwick sister,"" is now ten years old. Oldest sister Rosalind is in college, and Jane and Skye are both involved in their education and their own lives, so Batty preoccupies herself with her stepbrother Ben and two-year-old Lydia, her new half-sister. She is still deeply in mourning for her beloved Hound, the family dog, who died a few months before. Then she discovers she has a new talent, and, to further it, she starts her own business, walking neighbors' dogs. But along the way a secret will be revealed that will shatter Batty to her very soul.The storyline presents a very important lesson about what we say in front of children and how they interpret what they overhear. Batty's emotions are very real and very raw, and the chapters concerning her reaction might be upsetting to sensitive children. But the story is also incredibly realistic, painful, and touching, and I read through it with a lump in my throat, especially when Batty is working through her feelings at the death of Hound. So many parents don't understand how deep children's feelings go in regards to pets, and how they may hide those feeling so not to be considered ""silly.""A different type of Penderwick book, but rewarding on its own merits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SQCI9GQPMG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375870776#wasThisHelpful","R31SQCI9GQPMG4","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the Revolutionary War is upon them, and one by one their neighbors turn against them, for they are loyal to King George III. Prudence's best friend Abigail slowly is turned away from her as even the school is segregated along Tory and Patriot lines, the miller will not grind her father's grain.

Turner makes the point that the Tories were only traitors to those who had a Patriot viewpoint; otherwise they were just like anyone else, trying to make a living and abide by the laws, and that loyalties even crossed family lines as they would later do in the Civil War (you are never quite sure where Prudence's brother's feelings lie).

"Several books have come out about the ""Lusitania"" in this, the 100th anniversary of her sinking, and this treatment, by the author of ISAAC'S STORM and DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY turns the story into a tale of suspense, juxtaposing information about the passengers going aboard the ship and about the ship itself against the story of the U-20, the submarine which sank her. We meet the experienced captain of the ship, William Turner, and some of her famous passengers, including bookseller Charles Lauriat, Englishwoman Margaret Mackworth, producr Charles Frohman, Alfred Vanderbilt (yes, of those Vanderbilts), and Theodate Pope, a rarity in that era, a woman architect, plus the captain and crew of the U-boat.I particularly enjoyed how Larson fitted in the details of the time into the tale of the danger ""Lusitania"" was sailing into and the politics and hostilities that prompted the attack. Even the smallest details are enjoyable, such as how a heat wave struck New York days before ""Lucy's"" departure, while men still wore winter-weight hats (fashion dictated no lighter straw hats until May 1).

"This is sort of a book written by committee, and it shows.On the other hand, it's a nifty prequel to the Disney 2015 summer film TOMORROWLAND, which shows you what happened before the film begins. It opens initially in 1926 when 10-year-old Henry Stevens visits an exhibit about the future with his father, but the action chiefly takes place the first few days of July in 1939, as we follow Clara Brackett and her teenage son Lee as they attend the very first World Science Fiction Convention. A comic book is being given away at the convention, and it appears to hold the key to a secret that Lee and Clara become privy to by following clues contained within. But there are darker forces at work: the Nazi scientist Rotwang [Rotwang is the name of the evil scientist in METROPOLIS] and the spy he employs.There are certain neat situations in this book, including making Amelia Earhardt one of the heroes, but for me it tries too hard to recreate the campy adventure novels and serials from the 1930s. A pity, too, because the Plus Ultra organization, its founders, and what they have discovered are intriguing. Lee and Clara are appealing characters, however, and it was worth following them through their adventures to the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CX8BAOH7K1BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484704215#wasThisHelpful","R3CX8BAOH7K1BV","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally read this book in 2010, and this was my commentary:Think of this of ""a short history of nearly everything having to do with the home."" Bryson takes us from attic to cellar in the old vicarage he calls home in England to tell the story of private life. After examining the pivotal year of 1851, the Crystal Palace and the Great Expedition, and the land surrounding his home, Bryson starts with the basic structure of all human shelters, the one-room living space that became the medieval hall, and then visits each individual room to chronicle a different aspect of society: the bathroom to examine sanitation; the kitchen to talk about food (of course); the scullery to discuss servants, etc. The home becomes a springboard of discussion to architecture, social customs, furnishings, plants...even sexuality, and all in Bryson's engaging fashion.The true test of this book: it kept me absorbed in [the] 3 1/2 hour [DragonCon] ticket line in over 70 degree heat. Now that's interesting writing!In 2013, Doubleday brought this out in an illustrated edition, with vintage artwork, maps, schemata, drawings, photographs, portraits, etc. on glossy paper. I drooled the moment I saw it. And, by golly, I fell in love all over again, Adam fireplaces, Palladian homes, wonky WC fixtures, and all. Worth getting if you are into home histories or Bill Bryson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWCB2HP6SUH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385679432#wasThisHelpful","R2AWCB2HP6SUH5","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher prepares to head to her stepdaughter Belinda's school with her good friends Sakari and Melanie to see the girls participate in sports day, her husband, Scotland Yard inspector Alec Fletcher, and his team are called to Epping Forest to investigate a case of three bodies found buries in a secluded hollow. One corpse is still fresh and has a target pinned to him which says ""Revenge!"" The police officer on the job has already badly botched the investigation and takes an instant dislike to Alec, but Alec's superior is just relieved that this time it isn't Daisy who's discovered the body.At least not until a mystery involving a body draws Daisy into its orbit.The 1920s set Daisy Dalrymple mysteries usually have a light touch, although various circumstances arising from the Great War often come into play, but this one has a darker tone, a good half of it concerning Alec and his team (Sgt. Tring, Ernie Piper, and DC MacKinnon) investigating their crime while Daisy, her friends, and their daughters observe the drama at the school with three war veterans, two teachers disabled due to injuries, and a bullying, jingoistic games master. But Daisy's suggestion that the dead men might have a military connection brings out a story that is stylistically more Maisie Dobbs than Daisy's usual forte. A nice combination of plain sleuthing and moral repercussions make this story a cut above some of the entries. A solid entry in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z16FJVBJBFP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250002575#wasThisHelpful","R2Z16FJVBJBFP8","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1955, old-time radio, as it's now called, was dying. Television was making vast inroads into radio program ratings, and NBC's Sylvester ""Pat"" Weaver knew a different type of show was called for, one the audience would enjoy but would not demand their complete attention like television, made for car rides, days on the beach, and lazy weekend pastimes.The show he came up with was ""Monitor,"" a quirky combination of news, human-interest stories, comedy, music, on-location reports, sports, and anything else that kept the show on the go and ""doing things."" The result was a unique bit of radio that lasted for twenty years, albeit, especially in its last two years, with many changes.I remember ""Monitor"" mainly from Sunday afternoon ""rides in the car"" with my mom and dad, either to the seashore or the back roads, listening to James Daly or Henry Morgan, but mainly for the unforgettable sound of the ""Monitor Beacon,"" which could never be mistaken for any other sound in the universe (it's now my cell phone ringtone). I don't remember any specific bits of programs, but Mom recalled music on Sunday afternoon, five minute bits of OTR favorites Fibber McGee and Molly (Jim and Marian Jordan) in the early 1960s, and a mixed bag of stories and news.Author Hart loves ""Monitor"" and it shows. He takes every fact and facet he's collected and investigated and makes the volume a joyous look back for ""Monitor"" fans and all those curious about how radio met the challenge of television without resorting to endless records and disk jockeys (and, yes, there were ""Monitor"" imitators), from how the show was conceived, the cast chosen, and regular features of the broadcasts. After his first book about the series, ex-""Monitor"" employees and fans of the show contacted him, so this new edition contains even more stories and some memories from ""Monitor"" folks. Recommended for radio fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XX37Y3IZT9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=059528177X#wasThisHelpful","R11XX37Y3IZT9P","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Adam Walker practices medicine in Plumford, a small Massachusetts town on the banks of the Assabat River. One day while walking along the river, another man flags him down: he has just found the body of a young black man at the foot of a cliff. The man happens to be from the neighboring town of Concord, a rather odd fellow known as Henry David Thoreau. Soon Adam and his artistic cousin, Julia Bell, back in Plumford to care for her ailing grandfather, are drawn into trying to figure out how and why the young man was killed, as the town fathers are not interested in the strange death of the young ""Negro.""Thoreau makes an interesting addition to the cast of the mystery; however, the majority of the story is Adam and Julia's, told from the point of view of both their journals. The author, or actually authors, a husband and wife team, do their very best to make Adam and Julia sound like 19th century characters (albeit very liberally-minded ones) and have Thoreau's part in keeping with his character, making him into a central character without deifying or maligning him. The mystery was suitably convoluted, but be aware that this is not what you might call a ""cozy"" mystery if you're thinking of neat murders deduced by sweet elderly ladies in drawing rooms. There are breathless and frightening violence, virulent illness, and other rough crimes. If you understand that, you may enjoy this well-written period mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS3MUAK8RIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758290233#wasThisHelpful","R1FS3MUAK8RIT","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have checked the credits of 1960s and 1970s drama series, I'm certain the name ""John Meredyth Lucas"" will be familiar to you. He worked as a director or writer on series like BEN CASEY, MANNIX, and STAR TREK, and also many of the episodes of the long-running spiritual series INSIGHT. But his television career was just part of Lucas' unorthodox life. The son of a silent movie actor and a scenario writer/actress who later divorced, his stepfather became the acclaimed Golden Age film director Michael Curtiz, who did, among others, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CAPTAIN BLOOD, and CASABLANCA.This is an eye-opening book in more ways than one. While Lucas' later television and movie directing tales are interesting, his young life in Hollywood's chaotic movie colony are amazing and often horrifying, like the time he was seduced, at the tender age of twelve, by a drunken actress at one of his mother's parties. Today there would be lawsuits and arrests; in those days it was just something that happened. Lucas also has no bones about showing all aspects of his life: how he skipped school and sometimes drank too much. However, it's a fascinating tale of high- (and sometimes low-) living, the behind-the-scenes lives of movie people, and filmmaking in the silents versus in sound movies. Mother Bess Meredyth comes off as a woman before her time, Michael Curtiz a larger-then-life character from a movie.The text is liberally peppered with family photographs and behind-the-scenes publicity photos. Very enjoyable!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NVY3NB9VAH5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786418389#wasThisHelpful","R1NVY3NB9VAH5M","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific collection of English mystery stories, only two of which I had previously read (a Sherlock Holmes story and ""Death on the Air""), presented chronologically from the beginning of the 20th century through the 1980s. (There is a Dorothy Sayers story, but it is a Montague Egg, and I have only read Lord Peter Wimsey.) There are stories about amateur detectives and others that are police procedurals, and even stories where the people involved don't know there's been a mystery until the story is nearly completed. Some of the stories feature series detectives, like Inspector Thorndyke, Adam Dalgliesh, Father Brown, and Mrs. Bradley. In keeping with English tradition there is a sleeping-car murder, a crime ala Crippen, and murder at an Oxbridge-type institution, plus a murder at Oxford. I was quite taken by ""Superintendant Wilson's Holiday,"" in which that man does indeed have a busman's holiday in an entertaining police procedural. But the story that really blew me out of the water was Agatha Christie's classic ""The Witness for the Prosecution."" I'd never read it before and really, really loved the twist!Anyway, for mystery story fans, a worthwhile find to hunt down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3989JYQLG29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0192141872#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3989JYQLG29","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Great War is over and young Kitty Weekes is on the run. On false pretenses, she takes a job as a nurse at a convalescent home for shell-shocked soldiers, as much to escape her past as to earn money to make a living. As the new girl, she is given all the dirty jobs, yet she perseveres, slowly gaining the trust of her fellow nurses and the patients, from the patient man confined to a wheelchair to the angry man whose family are embarrassed that he is in a mental institution. But mysteries still abound: like the shadowy Patient Sixteen, and the growing uneasiness that something else, something evil, is creeping into the walls of Portis House, manifesting as an ugly black mold growing uncontrolled in a lavatory.As in all of St. James' mysteries, there is a supernatural element to the story, and the story is a mixture of thriller, mystery, romance, and an examination of the treatment of what is now called post-traumatic stress syndrome. The way the soldiers are treated is almost as frightening as the sinister feelings creeping through the house, and Kitty's encounter with a family member is as chilling as it is sad.The story is at its best when dealing with Kitty's learning process and her survival and the regard she comes to have for her patients (and the patients and the staff for her), and for the portrayal of the soldiers she nurses. The supernatural element is a bit derivative, and the final solution to the problem a bit overwrought, but the characters and the hospital and era setting overwhelm any misgivings I had about it. An edge-of-your-seat enjoyment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DUOJUMG9KF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419480#wasThisHelpful","R26DUOJUMG9KF0","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book sounded so intriguing that I ordered it despite the fact it was a hardback, and I was not disappointed. Dundas intertwines the adventures of Sherlock Holmes into the life story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and at the same time discovers the continuing fandom surrounding the character from its beginnings in journals written by men all the way through ""The Baker Street Babes,"" a podcast group comprised mostly of women who came to Holmes fandom through the BBC series SHERLOCK. He takes us through the stories and the novels, while visiting sites including (of course) Baker Street and Dartmoor, links Holmes' life with the real-life Victorian era, investigates the pastiches and the films, from William Gillette equipping Holmes with a calabash and a deerstalker to Basil Rathbone fighting Nazis in 1940s Britain to Benedict Cumberbatch texting in 21st century London.It's a great jolly mixed bag of fact and fiction and I loved it all. Dundas has a nice relaxed writing style that easily takes us from modern Baker Street to Holmes and Watson's digs to Conan Doyle retreating into Spiritualism after his son's death to modern literary spinoffs like Laurie King's Mary Russell mysteries. It's a perfect grab bag for any Sherlock Holmes fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAOH5KE7IF08F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544214048#wasThisHelpful","RAOH5KE7IF08F","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a suspenseful adventure set before the San Francisco earthquake and fire by the author of the ""Al Capone"" books. Like Jacqueline Kelly's Calpurnia Tate, protagonist Lizzie Kennedy is chafing against the social strictures for young women in 1905. She's stuck in a snooty girls' school and has no friends, and would prefer to go on house calls with her physician father. Lizzie's one true friend is Jinn, the family's Chinese cook, but he disappears and no one will tell her where he is. Then rumors of the plague begin, and Lizzie finds Jinn's son, Noah, hiding out in Jinn's room.Choldenko has created a real page-turner here, what with Lizzie trying to keep Noah hidden, the puzzle about Jinn's disappearance, and trying to keep her activities hidden from her imperious Aunt Hortense, who oversees the family with a will of steel. It also makes the subtle point that as much as Lizzie loves Jinn, he has an entire Chinese life that she has never considered; she sees him only as he is involved in her life.If I have one quibble with the book, it's that Lizzie seems to have a lot of unmonitored time, considering that Aunt Hortense is supposed to have eyes like an eagle, and she manages to ""borrow"" horses easily. But the characters are engaging, especially the friendship that grows between Lizzie and Noah, and the setting compelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETVZ23GL22C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385742533#wasThisHelpful","R3ETVZ23GL22C","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What, you say, could possibly be left to say about the film? Well, actually, this book touches on many of them, and most of them are good: chapters about the stars before they appeared in the film and then after their appearance (including Christopher Plummer's turnaround from snide comments to admirer), an interesting chapter that takes Maria's original THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGS and summarizes each chapter to note what made it into the stage play and into the film, the history of the film on home video and of its showings on television. One chapter talks about the two German films about the Trapp family that were made in the 1950s. A helpful chapter chronicles the changes between the stage play and the film (which should have been required reading before NBC presented their live version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC stage play so that so many people wouldn't have whined about how ""the story was out of order"")Sadly, there's an interminable sixty-four pages of listing each and every theater that THE SOUND OF MUSIC appeared in during its roadshow appearances in the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, plus a couple of other countries, down to how long the movie theater itself stayed open! Surely this could have been summarized in less than ten pages by hitting the highlights (for instance, a list of the cities where it ran the longestin some cities it played for 118 weeks at the same theatre! [yes, that's over two years, and this was before the invention of multiplexes]and a few unusual facts about the theatergoers, such as a British woman who saw THE SOUND OF MUSIC 960 times during its roadshow years). Thirty four pages are devoted to the original stars of the stage playand then every single one of their replacements and each of the cast members of the revivals! A moderately interesting chapter is about the soundtrack albums, but it goes into el cheapo knockoffs as well. Another long chapter which is moderately interesting but really should have used some trimming is about SOUND OF MUSIC references in everything from movies to television shows, including multiple instances on THE SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY; if it was an elaborate parody or an extended scene, this would have been worth it, but some of these cites are one line and seem like mere paddingthere's 69 pages of this!If you're a SOUND OF MUSIC completest, by all means buy, but I'd look for the cheapest deal or wait until you can find a sale copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADU0KVH15GN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480360430#wasThisHelpful","R3ADU0KVH15GN9","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caroline is back at her cousin's farm in the country, homesick for Sacketts Harbor, to help out as her aunt and uncle get on their feet after having to flee their prosperous farm in Canada during the War of 1812. Traitors to the American cause are selling supplies to the British and Caroline soon fears that her uncle Aaron is one of them. But as they get acquainted with the neighbors, it seems that several of them could be the culprits, too.My main complaint with this book is that Caroline and Lydia are supposed to be keeping house and doing farm chores while Aunt Martha is nursing a sick neighbor. ""Keeping house"" in those days was an intensive job which involved day-to-day drudgery. Where the dickens did they get the time to keep an eye on the potash still and walk miles and miles from neighbor to neighbor to ""borrow"" things while asking questions? The little clues help you solve the mystery pretty well, nevertheless.I need to complain about this newest sequence of mysteries, though. For one thing, I hate the dreadful ""Beforever"" theme that they're now smacking on all the books. ""Beforever"" what? It's stupid. Plus the cover drawings of each of the girls is pretty vacuous; Kit is perhaps the worst. All the girls look alike except for hair and eye color, and Caroline is shown wandering around the woods in what looks like a good dress and her hair all in curls. Really? Really?

"Well, I'm disappointed. Usually the Kit mystery is always the best of the three new mysteries that American Girl issues every year. This one was remarkably simplisticwhile the Caroline and Samantha mysteries puzzled me for awhile, it was almost immediately obvious about the identity of one character and who the ""bad guy"" of the piece was (and that person was a pretty disappointing villain, too). Story: a famous swing band is coming to Cincinnati and Kit is lucky enough to win tickets to the concert. (Kit and her dad are big jazz/swing fans.) She has the chance to interview ""Swingin' Slim Simpson""and Mr. Gibson even says, if it's good enough, he may publish Kit's story in the main paper rather than the children's section. (The one real fantasy aspect of this continuing storyline.) But someone is trying to sabotage the Simpson band performance!The plot ""hook"" here, promoted in the description, the theft of Slim' special trumpet, happens so quickly and is resolved so quickly that it's barely interesting.

Samantha still speaks too familiarly with the servants (and they right back).

"I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for ""free"" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention.But I've never been ""in love"" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said.As far as I can tell, there's nothing this phone can't do, or I haven't run into it yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BRP74RBC1CAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZTSNNS#wasThisHelpful","R2BRP74RBC1CAT","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun, yet properly puzzling mystery story that takes place at a science fiction convention. Our protagonist is Jacob Foster, a young man whose ambition it is to be a police officer. He's taking his mind off his nervousness about applying for the academy by attending a convention with his friends, but discovers he'll have to put some sleuthing skills to work after a young woman is found dead and it becomes apparent that she was deliberately poisoned. The last thing Jacob and any of the other convention workers want is a panic spreading out among the attendees.Laura Baugh chronicles a typical multi-focus SF convention on paper and represents it perfectly: the fun, the chaos, the nonstop action, demanding guests, and overworked staff, addressing everything from cosplay to the vagaries of DVD releases of fan favorites to behind-the-scenes drama. Jacob is Everyfan right from the start (registration messes up his badge; how typical!), someone you would enjoy being friends with, and his companions, including an aspiring voice actress, come off as ""real folks"" and not stereotypes. I was also partial to Jacob's Aunt Lydia, who, in one marvelous scene, tells off a couple of sneering jocks in fine style. (It's one of those scenes you can't read without sticking your fist in the air and saying ""Yes!"")In addition, there are sly references to a fan-favorite television show that never got released on DVD which are worked so appropriately into the text it brings a big grin to your face.I enjoyed this so much I've already read it twice, and I'll probably read it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVLDPXCDNMFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5UEB7I#wasThisHelpful","R1XVLDPXCDNMFF","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally had to order these shoes from Amazon because none of the shoe stores here had it, and neither did Reebok or anyone else online. I felt quite odd ordering shoes here.I have worn the Reebok youth/big kid/boys shoe (whatever they're calling it this year) for years because I have a small women's foot (size 6) in which no manufacturer makes a shoe wide enough anymore (even Hush Puppies, which used to be my go-to). Even if I can find a 6W in a Reebok it is not as wide as this shoe. Plus it is an identical shoe to the women's shoe, but usually $20 less! (Another example of how women are overcharged for clothing.)I admit these modern shoes are not as good as the ones they have made in the past. I notice the soles on these are a 1/4 inch thinner than my old pair, which are two years old. The stitching that fastens the tongue to the shoe is bulky and rubs against my right foot, but that foot is always slightly swollen since I tore the ligaments in it 13 years ago. Frankly, since I was in junior high I have never had a shoe that, however comfortable later on, did not hurt me until I got them ""broken in.""

"One doesn't learn much about Calvin Coolidge in history class. He succeeded Harding after he died, he was president during ""the Roaring 20s,"" he believed ""the business of American is business,"" he was a Republican who supported some progressive causes. He was from Vermont, served as Massachusetts governor, and lost one of his teenage sons while in office. But his most famous quality was his reticence; he never used five words if one would do, and his nickname was ""Silent Cal.""Shlaes fills in all the missing pieces about John Calvin Coolidge in this stout volume that goes from his ancestors to his death, his schooldays at an academy, his early days practicing law, etc. It's incredibly detailed; as with William Patterson's book about Robert Heinlein, it's like Shlaes was a fly on the wall. He even makes a note at one point that the Coolidge family's collie was sick. Still, most of the narrative is enjoyable, although I felt like much of the time Shlaes was trying overly hard to make me like Coolidge, and that, although he didn't talk much, he was a much warmer person than he appeared. Shlaes also emphasizes how hard Coolidge tried to cut down on Government spendingand how in many cases he did.The biggest irony of reading this book was that I was doing so during the investigations into the Department of Veterans Affairs, because  in the 1920s Coolidge was furious about excesses and graft at the Veterans Bureau, as it was called then: tales of employees receiving equivalents of today's six-figure salaries for a month's work, or stealing supplies from the veterans to sell for profit. Things, sadly, never change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20E63BTOH0J55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061967599#wasThisHelpful","R20E63BTOH0J55","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When first the television series MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT and slightly later the film THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN were released, James Thurber's books enjoyed a resurgence, and THE THURBER CARNIVAL, THE THURBER ALBUM, MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT, THURBER'S DOGS, and this book were all republished. I devoured them all, and even though I had barely heard of ""The New Yorker,"" quite enjoyed Thurber's memoir of the eccentric original editor of the magazine, a country boy who wanted to present the most sophisticated of city magazines, an earthy man who was nevertheless shy about sexual references and had difficulties talking to most women, a man who did not finish school but who provided expert editing of the articles that made ""The New Yorker"" a survivor. Ross' personal quirks were well known to anyone who worked on the magazine, and Thurber affectionately chronicles his foibles and his ""Rossisms.""For a full story of Harold Ross and his magazine one should go to other sources, but for a memoir of Ross by someone who was there during his tenure, crossed horns with him, but still respected him, Thurber's account is amusing, if not often laugh-aloud funny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBJ5Q9D0FSTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060959711#wasThisHelpful","R2WBJ5Q9D0FSTD","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's almost Christmas, not to mention Jimmy's long-awaited thirteenth birthday, when he and his friend Blake, son of the town vet, come up with a scheme to get all the animals in the overcrowded no-kill shelter adopted by Christmas. Jimmy's idea has been inspired by an elderly toymaker, Gabriel Nicholson, who's helping out with the town toy drive. Plus he's coping with playing Joseph in the Christmas pageant and trying to understand his grumpy neighbor Mr. Krebs, who seems to hate animals as much as his granddaughter Megan loves themand wondering why his parents seem to have forgotten his birthday.This story is based on the LASSIE television series episode ""Lassie's Gift of Love,"" although in this version Mr. Nicholson now travels in a classic truck rather than a wagon, and has a horse named Bess instead of a donkey name Holly. (Bess is another borrowing from Eric Knight's LASSIE COME-HOME, the name of Rowlie Palmer's horse.) Mr. Krebs in the book doesn't seem half as grouchy as Matt Krebs in the television version, and the animal adoption scheme could have come straight out of a plot from THE NEW LASSIE. It's a pleasant enough Christmas tale, however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1GBPBCIYIJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781402646#wasThisHelpful","R1U1GBPBCIYIJL","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jimmy is looking forward to a camping trip he'll be taking after school closes with his Dad and Uncle Cully, but when a man in his Dad's congregation is badly injured, Uncle Cully takes Jimmy and Lassie camping on his own. They are faring well, even after having their canoe set adrift by another visitor to the Lake Superior islands they are camping at. But when they see a beautiful eagle and find a lone cabin, once the home of a naturalist, Jimmy, his uncle, and Lassie are plunged into danger.This is based on the LASSIE television series two-parter ""The Treasure,"" with certain parallels: camping, a character named Cully, an eagle (but not a golden eagle), a naturalist's cabin, and a mysterious message about treasure. In this outing the marauding poacher is more deadly than the television version, and part of the adventure serves to lead Uncle Cully, who's not a Christian any longer, to find his faith. There are some really lovely descriptions of the forest here and the beauty of nature. Jimmy's musing about his uncle's lack of faith may annoy some, but it's a nice solid adventure story, and even Jimmy's little sister, Sarah, after being a non-entity in the first book, does a good turn for him in this one. Of the first three books, this is my favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV8ONDT1QFBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781402638#wasThisHelpful","R2MV8ONDT1QFBM","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard of this series of books for a few years now, but had never seen a copy until I walked into a used bookstore and found the first three books of this five-book series written in the 1990s for a Christian publisher. In this incarnation, Lassie belongs to the Harmon family and specifically to 12-year-old Jimmy, whose father is a minister, and in the first book of the series, Jimmy's faith is tested when Lassie is locked in a van and taken several hundred miles from home. His parents take him looking for her, but every lead seems to go nowhere. God, reasons Jimmy, knows how important to Lassie is to him, so why did God allow this to happen?If you're a Lassie fan, the basic plot may sound a bit familiar: it's because Bray based the books on plots from the television series. This one is based on ""Lassie's Odyssey"" and we follow both Lassie's travels and the Harmons' efforts to find her. She eventually, as you might have suspected from the title, ends up in a circus. There are also touches of the Timmy episode ""The Dognappers."" The elder Harmons are named Paul and Ruth, the next book features an ""Uncle"" Cully, and the third a ""Mr. Krebs"" and a mysterious ""Mr. Nicholson."" As for the story, I found some of the prose a bit stilted; Bray was trying to give it a LASSIE COME-HOME touch (she even repeats the story of how Sam Carraclough taught Lassie not to pick up meat off the ground) and her descriptions of Lassie's thoughts and the countryside are often beautiful but sometimes awkward. The Christian bits of the prose are not intrusive; it's basically still a matter of faith with Jimmy to believe that Lassie will still come home.(Incidentally, Bray, taking another cue from Eric Knight, describes Lassie as a tricolor, but the television Lassie is a sable. A tricolor is mostly black.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17WXN1B54ARQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078140262X#wasThisHelpful","R17WXN1B54ARQB","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stories about children who overcame physical handicaps were very popular when I was growing up, and this book is a classic: the story of a Catholic family faced with an almost insurmountable problem who rose to the challenge.Karen was born three months premature and didn't go home until she was nine months old. Her parents soon notice that she doesn't move like other babies. She is diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and at that time (the 1940s)  there was no support at all for children (or adults for that matter) with cerebral palsy. The first doctor her parents took Karen to basically told the Killileas to put her in an institution and forget her. The next said she was probably mentally deficient. They went through more than a dozen doctors before they found one to help Karen. Plus their elder daughter had sinus problems, a bout with rheumatic fever, and then a tuberculosis scare; and money was short and for a time the father worked two jobs.This is an old-fashioned book with the appropriate mores of the 1940s-1950s. I was amused to see how so many modern reviews of this book on Amazon had shocked people exclaiming how often the characters smoked and how bad that was! Even in the Sixties everyone smoked! Doctors recommended cigarettes in advertising. I remember family parties and weddings blue with smoke. I was more appalled by the way so many doctors treated Karen as if she was some sort of vegetable. They couldn't seem to get past the fact she was ""crippled"" as if her motor problems affected her brain. And this was the state of medicine only 25 years before I was born! (I recall a neighborhood friend whose sister had severe Down syndromeback then they were called ""Mongoloid""and her family was considered unusual because Louise lived at home and was not in an asylum.) The work Marie Killilea and her family did eventually resulted in the creation of the United Cerebral Palsy organization. Still, this is an inspiring story, even today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO52A9NOS65IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440943760#wasThisHelpful","RO52A9NOS65IE","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, this book is just fun: ten stories based on Dave Stevens' classic comic book ""The Rocketeer,"" later made into a little more family-friendly film by Disney that was still one heck of an adventure.All the pulpy tropes are here: square-jawed hero Cliff Secord who has a secret identity as a crime- and Nazi-fighting ""rocketeer"" using a jet pack developed by Howard Hughes, his lush and curvy girlfriend Betty (based on Bettie Page) who's usually to be found half-clad, his grumpy mentor and whiz mechanic Peevy, evil Nazis and mad scientists, and even some exotic locales, not to mention flying monkeys, sharkmen, Egyptian curses, doppelgangers, a snoopy tell-all reporter, supercilious flatfoots, goons, gun molls, and more. Plus there are some delightful cameos by real life people, and those were the three stories I enjoyed the most: ""The Red, White & Grey"" featuring Western author Zane Grey, ""Codename: Ecstasy"" with Hedy Lamarr, and ""Rockets to Hell"" guest-starring Johnny Weissmuller and featuring a creepy setting and enemy. I'm wondering if a sequel anthology is planned because at least three of the stories, including ""Rockets to Hell,"" are definitely set up where another story is possible.Unlike those classic pulps, Betty, even in her half-clad state, has brains, and doesn't turn into a fainting, clingy, actual pulp damsel in distress. One of the stories talks about discrimination against women specifically (perhaps a bit too didactically), and there are other female characters who are strong and no one's ""dame."" Do note if you have a child who's a fan of Disney's ROCKETEER that this is a much more adult universe and not suitable for the very young: nothing is described, but Cliff and Betty are not chaste, and there are many instances of graphic violence, especially in ""Atoll of Terror,"" which owes more than a tip of the hat to H.G. Wells. As Peevy might say, ""This ain't no kiddie story, y'know.""Oh, I immediately gave this to my husband to read. He gives it an enthusiastic ""Five Stars!"" too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGYNDGEJQ26Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613779070#wasThisHelpful","R2FGYNDGEJQ26Y","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest, when I saw the synopsis of this novel, I was on the fence about buying it. I loved the first book in the Josephine Tey series because it so closely reproduced a 1930s novel. The second and third books were good, but had their problems, especially aspects of the second. However, I took a chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised yet ultimately disappointed. The story is told in flashback, with Josephine's longtime friend Archie Penrose discovering that a double murder and suicide that had taken place in 1936 were not all that they had seemed. The main portion of the story takes place in Portmerion, Wales, where Josephine is meeting with Alfred Hitchcock and his wife with the object of making her book A Shilling for Candles into a film, as well as celebrating her birthday. But first one, then two brutal murders take place.Upson carefully builds her setting and characters, so carefully that the book is half over before the actual crimes take place. It's well crafted and described, and, especially with the settings, very evocative, but one must be patient to get to the meat of the story, which builds like...well, like a Hitchcock film. Lots of talking, and revealing of secrets happen. Hitch himself, debating whether to make the jump to Hollywood, has brief flashes of appearances (mostly planning macabre practical jokes), so we don't really learn much about him. And, frankly, I'm tired of the Josephine/Marta storyline; sometimes a romance adds something to a story, this one just stalls it. I'd recommend for the atmosphere and the description, but your patience may be tried sorely aiming for the plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MBNDNM0PBIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062195433#wasThisHelpful","R13MBNDNM0PBIP","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, originally published in 2006 and recently updated for the 50th anniversary, puts yet another spin on a DOCTOR WHO history. Most usually follow season by season, perhaps just an episode guide, others with more elaborate guides, down to one that tracked inconsistencies in the stories, and then there are Mad Norwegian Press' mega-guides. However, this one, after chronicling how the show was conceived, examines the series by eras and how the shows changed over time, influenced by the mores, the customs, the influences, and even the politics of when they were filmed (for instance, spies were popular in the 1960s, so Jon Pertwee's Doctor was action-oriented; however, because the series was now in color, which was more expensive to film, the character remained Earthbound for most of his run because Earth-set episodes were cheaper). Of equal interest is his analysis of the changing role of the companion.Even after reading the ""mega-guides,"" The Discontinuity Guide, the paperback episode guides, and other series guides, I still found a lot to like about this volume, which also includes commentary on TORCHWOOD and THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTDGZNM8C4RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780761406#wasThisHelpful","R1CTDGZNM8C4RU","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grace Wheaton, after having been threatened and emotionally used by a thief in the previous book, has accompanied her boss, millionaire philanthropist Bennett Marshfield, to Europe, where she meets his oldest friend, an Italian art collector.

But even reaching home doesn't end the danger for both Bennett and Grace.This is an enjoyable outing in the Manor House mysteries, with many suspects and red herrings, although about twenty pages from the end it becomes blindingly obvious who the culprit is. One of the things I appreciated the most was that Grace's ordeal from the previous book has not been forgotten; she reacts to several dangerous situations in the same manner as a soldier would suffering post-traumatic stress and is suspicious and quick to react.

"Eat, sleep, breathe...books. This is for everyone who has felt kinship with the literary characters they grew up with, and how they have shaped, whether or not we realize it, who we are and how we think. Ellis grew up reading the classics and loving their authors and characters, from LITTLE WOMEN to Sylvia Plath, from WHAT KATY DID and Anne Shirley to Cathy Earnshaw and the ladies of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, books that were sometimes far removed from her upbringing as an Iraqi Jew in London. She not only tells us of the books she loved growing up, but also how she looked at them re-reading them as an adult, and how her favorite characters in the books changed from childhood to adulthood.Ellis has a nice breezy style that makes this an easy and enjoyable read, and it's always fun to see what devoted readers log as their favorite books, even though I occasionally thought her book choices odd (but that's just different tastes). If one thing bothered me, it was Ellis' opinions of her old favorites. While I view my old childhood favorites differently than I did as a child, I don't see them as lacking as Ellis did (for example, Katy Carr). They're the products of their time and it's not their fault they don't conform to modern ideas.

"My husband sustained a fall down the stairs in January and has had trouble walking ever since. During a gathering with friends, he saw a two-handled handcrafted cane that helped the user get out out chairs. While this cane wasn't handcrafted, the two-handle arrangement looked useful for him, and it certainly has been. He would have given it 4 1/2 stars if that option existed. He loves the lightweight, all aluminum construction and the hollow handles which can be used for keys, dog treats, etc.; the flashlight on the top handle proved very useful to see while walking our dog on vacation at night as we were in a cabin in the woods with no streetlights (I used it myself; it snowed on one of the days and it was helpful in keeping my balance as well). The second handle below the first is super-helpful for giving him an extra boost out of a sofa or chair. Faults: the light switch for the flashlight is in a place where it is easily triggered and it is often turned on without noticing.

"The saga of Diana Bishop, once reluctant witch, and Matthew Clermont, a vampire whose ""life"" spans centuries, begun in A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES and SHADOW OF NIGHT comes to a conclusion as Diana, Matthew, their family and their friends face a new enemy just as they are growing closer to securing the enchanted book that Diana once summoned from the Bodelian library at Oxford University. An old friend is lost, other old friends return, and the family makes new allies, but it is obvious that Diana is being stalked even as she comes into her full powers. Revenge is the motive and it is Matthew that will have to pay if Diana is not turned over to the stalker. The chase takes them to England, France, and even Venice.I buried my nose in this book when it arrived and didn't come up for air until it was finished, but yet have to admit that I did not find it the strongest entry in the trilogy. The violence and the description of it that happens in the last half of the book is very strong and that may have contributed to this feeling; yet the violence that occurs is not gratuitous to the plot. It is very graphically depicted, so be forewarned. Several other surprises are revealed, and, as always, Harkness goes into the minute detail of the previous books, which I enjoyed but I know some readers did not. Still, a satisfactory conclusion to the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JD0IE67XCCNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025593#wasThisHelpful","R1JD0IE67XCCNL","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure how I missed this Heinlein juvenile for so long; it was his first, written back in the late 1940s, but taking place in some indeterminate future where man has already gone to space and rockets are used as freighters. Three teenage boys, Art, Morrie, and Ross, model rocketry enthusiasts with their own workship, find an unconscious man outside their launch area and are afraid it was caused by their rocket which exploded. The man turns out to be Art's uncle Don, an atomic scientistwho soon is impressed by their talent and wonders if they'd like to accompany him on a flight to the moon! But it turns out there are people who wish to stop Don Cargraves and young proteges...permanently.While Heinlein uses solid science in his rocketry, the plot is pure Boy's Own Adventure story, what with intelligent high schoolers recruited by an adult to go on an adventure; Samuel Scoville would be proud of this space-age successor to his Boy Scout stories. If you can buy the smart-kids-recruited-by-scientist trope, the rest of it is a great adventure tale. Swelp me, I was boggled by their discovery on the moon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVTWKYXEBE6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8XGKVU#wasThisHelpful","R2IVTWKYXEBE6T","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Police detective Frank Malloy knows he'll never live up to Sarah Brandt's social inheritance, even though she abandoned her place in society to marry a doctor and now, after his death, works as a midwife in the poorer sections of town. So when Sarah's father, millionaire Felix Decker, asks to see Frank privately, the detective is mystified until the problem is explained: a well-known businessman died in Decker's exclusive club, and he wishes Frank to find out the culprit so the club can take care of the problem by themselves and not create a scandal. But once Frank starts talking to the family, something more ugly than a quarrel between friends emerges.This is probably the first Brandt/Malloy book in which after things are revealed, that you wish the killer won't be caught because the victim was such a right bastard. This means, of course, that there are multiple suspects, and multiple false leads for both Frank and Sarah to track down, and there's suspense down to the penultimate chapter. Once again, Sarah's bored society mother helps in their investigation (I'm coming to quite like the woman!), and the sordid realities of some parts of Victorian society are revealed. This is a nice solid entry in the series, even if only the tiniest progress is made on the attraction between Frank and Sarah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99LRL9HX3XNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255379#wasThisHelpful","R99LRL9HX3XNC","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's taken me two years to read this book; I started it, then went on to other things after getting one-third of the way through and didn't get back to it until this spring, when I had to quickly re-read the first third to re-acquaint myself with what had gone before. Is this procrastination due to this being a bad book? No, but like THE WAR THAT ENDED PEACE, it's a dense book with a great deal packed within each chapter (perhaps too much), which chronicles the Victorian era from Princess Victoria's ascendancy through the death of the Queen.However, instead of being a simple linear history of the Victorian era, each chapter focuses on a different subject that is pertinent to the timeline, so that while the history starts routinely enough with chapters about Britain before Victoria and the background of her family, subsequent chapters address not just historical events (the Crimea, the Irish troubles and the famine, the Boer War) and personages (Lord Palmerston, Gladstone, ""Chinese"" Gordon, Disraeli), but artists, authors, playwrights, health conditions in the slums, science, medicine, and other topics. Truth to tell, the politics is, as always, chiefly boring, but I enjoyed the chapters about pre-Raphaelite painters, expatriate British living in England, the Raj, the impact of Darwin, people of color in Victorian society, public schooling abuses, country parsons, Gilbert and Sullivan, Oscar Wilde, and dozens of other personalities and social dilemmas. If you've a serious interest in the Victorian era, you may enjoy this book, but it's not for those just looking for a summary of the time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A6ONRNFZET6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393325431#wasThisHelpful","R3A6ONRNFZET6Z","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liv Montgomery, fresh from a nightmarish career as an event arranger in New York City, has moved to the smaller upstate New York town of Celebration Bay to continue her career in a calmer venue. At least she thought it would be calmer, until during last-minute preparation for the town's annual fall festival, a man is found dead in an apple press.Some cozies are artificially set and cast, while in others the characters and settings come to life. I could believe in the little community of Celebration Bay, which has created a new persona for itself by living up to its name and hosting festivals that draw people from all over the country. Liv and her neighbors, even the annoying former event arranger Janine, who has a grudge against Liv, are suitably ""real"" enough, although minor characters are quite sketchy. The mystery is suitably complicated, although close to the end I figured out most of the puzzle. Yes, there are cozy mystery conventions: our heroine gets herself into a perilous situation while investigating the crime, and, as seems to be common with mysteries with a female lead these days, there's an exasperating male romantic interest. And I did get tired of the descriptions of Liv's dog Whiskey as a ""Westie terrier."" C'mon, after three or four times we know he's a terrier; just call him a Westie. Or vary it with ""West Highland White terrier."" However, I liked the story and the regular characters enough to buy the sequels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYFO3U6360CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425251551#wasThisHelpful","R3GYFO3U6360CW","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He's dead. No, he's alive, because Queen Mab isn't going to let her Winter Knight get away. So Harry Dresden has accepted a devil's bargain, because he knows he has to protect his Chicago home town from the evil that is emerging.Butcher starts out with a bang. Harry awakes, alive, only to have Mab try more and more inventive ways to kill himseventy-seven different scenarios, all told. And that's just in chapter one! He acquires a malk (kind of a supernatural cat) that he names Cat Sith to help him, as well as a young woman who seems to be being put through the same paces as Harry. Then Mab's insane daughter Maeve (think Bellatrix Lestrange, only more insane) makes an appearance just about the time Harry makes an enemy of a bloodthirsty Redcap.After that, it gets crazy.This newest (in paperback, anyway) Dresden adventure brings back all the old favorites: Karrin Murphy, Waldo Butters, Harry's half-brother Thomas, Harry's temple dog Mouse, his apprentice Molly, Mac the bartender, and even little Toot-Toot, Harry's fairy ally, and his troops (whom Harry keeps happy with pizza). Occasionally Harry gets to take a breather, and you do, too, only to have another situation crop up to leave you breathless. Once you start turning pages, it's hard to stop. Plus there's some great Karrin action, and a heartbreaker of an ending. Yeah, I'm still hooked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV4JNZQTL8NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045141912X#wasThisHelpful","RRV4JNZQTL8NS","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth and final book in Teale's seasonal odyssey across the United States with his wife Nellie; the four books were written between 1947 and 1966, and this final book won a Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. Teale, a naturalist, originally wrote for Popular Science, but then became a free-lancer, and authored over a dozen books about the subject.You would think that this book would address the snowy and cold areas of the country, but the Teales begin their trip in San Diego and work their way east, only encountering true winter weather when they get to the edge of the midwest. They see whales, observe the plants of the desert surviving brutal drought, observe birds over the entire trip, their favorite being the cheeky chickadee, have adventures along the Mexican border, then head into snow and ice storms as they drive toward the northeast, where they hunt for diamonds, discover a colony of white squirrels, explore Big Bone Lick and its cache of prehistoric bones, visit a sugarbush and a deer yard, and join a man who collects witch hazel. Along the way, they visit fellow naturalists, avid birdwatchers, and the home of ""Snowflake"" Bentley, who took the first microscopic photos of snowflakes.This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves exploring the natural world, whether in person or vicariously through books. I'm hoping to turn up his other three books to visit the seasonal US in an era before superhighways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PA1E0KXU94JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312044585#wasThisHelpful","R1PA1E0KXU94JA","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Julia Grey and her husband, investigator Nicholas Brisbane, are once again home in London, with Julia trying to persuade him to make her a more active partner in his cases. She is stunned to find him working for her impeccable eldest brother Bellmont, the stolid ""white sheep"" of the erratic March clan. When she discovers a connection to the celebrated spiritualist Madame Seraphine, Julia's foray in investigating on her own only leaves her trapped in Madame's homeonly to find her husband hiding there as well.The story starts out a bit predictably with Julia's experiments and the expected bantering with Brisbane, whose reluctance for her to participate in investigations still persists despite promises made to her in the previous novel. This is growing a bit tiresome, but at the end of the novel it appears it may have been resolved. One can only hope. My favorite part was the sequence with the gypsy camp, and the mystery was excellent. Several old favorites appear, including Julia's headstrong father, her sister Portia still doting over her former lover's child, and her younger brother Plum, whose growing attraction to a young woman brings out another aspect of the mystery. Sometimes Julia, and Brisbane, the  stalwart moody Victorian hero, are both over the top, but they're fun to read.

"A book about colonial Boston and its role in the Revolutionary War. How could I resist? The narrative opens in 1760, with an account of the Great Fire, and ends with the reading of the Declaration of Independence. In between there are Stamp Acts, acts of rebellion, and ""the shot heard 'round the world.""My favorite part of this book are the descriptions of everyday Bostonthe sights and sounds and smells of the streets, tar, ocean breeze, livestock, the hammers and squeaks of pulleys and shouting from the waterfrontand the people who lived there, from the poor apprentices at the wharfs to the solid working people to the opulent rich like John Hancock. Populated by the characters of the Revolution you know (Samuel Adams, John Adams, Paul Revere, Israel Putnam, Joseph Warren) and ones you probably don't (Samuel Prescott, William Dawes, Josiah Quincy, Robert Newman, Mercy Otis), it's a vivid narrative of the passions of the opening salvo of the Revolutionary War. A super epilogue follows up on the fates of all the people, and some of the places, mentioned, including the Tories forced out of the city after the British evacuation. At times a bit wordy, but readable and absorbing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7P83AKUA9F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594161755#wasThisHelpful","RF7P83AKUA9F0","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this last of the Monk television adaptations by Goldberg, Adrian Monk's life seems to be going fine. While his former assistant Natalie Teeger is still in New Jersey, trying to decide if life as a police officer in the little town of Summit is for her, her daughter Julie is helping Monk with his cases, and Monk's agoraphobic brother Ambrose is marrying his ladylove Yuki (see MR. MONK ON THE ROAD). Monk even has a girlfriend now, but that's the problem. When some of his theories don't pan out, he feels like his happiness may be losing him his edge in solving crimes. Then to add tension to the perpetually tense detective, his mortal enemy ""Dale the Whale"" is being transferred from prison to hospital for surgery. When Dale escapes, it's Monk's good friend Captain Stottlemeyer who gets the blame.Goldberg neatly ties up all his own plot threads before leaving the book series to be taken over by Hy Conrad, including the return (no spoileryou knew it had to happen) of Natalie. I'd figured out some aspects of Dale's part of the crime about halfway through the book, but it was great to see Natalie now as a partner, and for Ambrose's happiness to be complete. No goofy jokes in this one, just a satisfying conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1G7IHGG1K9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451416031#wasThisHelpful","R2K1G7IHGG1K9X","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The combination of country house mystery and Christmas is irresistible, and Georgie is one of my favorite cozy characters.

"Miss Gwen's (see PASSION OF THE PURPLE PLUMARIA) bestselling new book, a Gothic thriller called THE CONVENT OF ORSINO, has Society all a-twitter about vampire stories. Sally Fitzhugh, younger sister of ""Turnip,"" is intrigued when she hears the rumor that the Duke of Belliston is a vampire and takes a dare to check out his garden, where she comes face-to-face with a less-than-vampiric duke himself, who nevertheless has returned to England under a cloud of suspicion, as it has been long since believed he murdered his own parents.

"As a native Rhode Islander, a mystery set in 19th century Newport, Rhode Island, was irresistible to me. Our heroine Emma Cross is a second cousin to the Vanderbilts, alas, with none of the money. She makes ends meet by writing dull society columns for the local newspaper; the only type of reporting her editor thinks is fit for a woman to do, even though Emma would like more of a challenge. But while reporting about a party at the Vanderbilt ""summer cottage"" the Breakers, Emma is a witness to the murder of Cornelius Vanderbilt's financial secretary, and, even worse, her black sheep brother is blamed for the death. Emma knows feckless Brady can't be the murderer, but who is? Could it even be one of her cousins, people she grew up with, played with as children, and still sees socially as an adult?I'll probably end up buying the next book in the series just because of the setting, but I really didn't believe in Emma as a 19th century heroine. Certainly there were forward-thinking women in those days, but she sounds more like a 20th century woman playing Victorian heroine. I was also disappointed with a main subplot; why make our heroine a self-sufficient working girl and then immediately introduce a love interest?

Not only did I read it, I enjoyed most of it, although my old bete noire algebra struck againeven with Bellos' amusing and simple explanations, I still didn't understand the algebra, and the statistics chapter was just as bad.

There are chapters, predictably, on pi, the Golden Ratio, magic squares and other math puzzles, gambling odds, and bell curves. Other chapters discuss different societies' ways of numeration, math tricks including Vedic mathematics, number sequences, data collection, and infinite numbers, and we learn about people who play with these numbers, some just for fun, others for a living.I hate math, but I loved this book.

"The Doctor negates Clara's wish to see King Arthur and instead takes them to 19th century London where a unique power spike impossible in Victorian times has just occurred. Despite the Doctor not wanting to bother the Paternoster Gang, they meet Jenny Flint almost immediately; she is searching for a man who was about to seek Madame Vastra's help and then died by mysterious means. Strax is also on a search, for whomever killed his sparring partner, a pugilist named Bellamy. Very soon, the five of them realize the mystery revolves around the Carnival of Curiosities performing at the Frost Fair, and particularly with a shadow play performer named Silhouette.I'll assume Richards was given copies of the early 12th Doctor scripts and perhaps an outline of where the character was going; he hasn't quite captured the eccentricities of Capaldi's Doctor, but it's getting there. The villain of the piece is pretty typical of what's been on the series before (going back to the classic series as well), but the suspense is well done and Clara's newfound spunk is in full bloom. The story has a ""Weng-Chiang/Fang Rock"" atmosphere about it that will please fans of the old series, and I found I enjoyed this more than I expected, and more than I have of books based on the previous incarnations in the new series.

"In this second of the Celebration Bay cozy mysteries, town events' manager Liv Montgomery is overseeing what plans to be the most beautiful Christmas the town has known. The square will be nostalgically dressed for the holiday season and all sorts of events are planned, but there's one fly in the ointment: the tacky new Christmas shop that has opened right on the square, spoiling its cozy nostalgia with windows festooned with drunken reindeer, beer-belly Santas under palm trees, and other tacky and inappropriate decorations, with the proprietor a grumpy Scrooge of a woman. Just when the town inhabitants think things can't get any worse, the man the owner of the Christmas shop hired to play Santa Claus has his throat cut in the store during the town Christmas parade.Freydont populates her town with people you'd love to know: the friendly bakery owner who cooks delicious treats (even for Liv's West Highland White terrier), the gregarious coffee shop owner, the nurturing quilt shop owner, the ex-hippie natural gift shop proprietor, a friendly good ol' boys club of a town council, two darling elderly ex-schoolteachers, Liv's 60-ish assistant Ted who has daily ""singing"" bouts with Whiskey the terrier, the bewhiskered older man who always plays Santa Claus so well, one bitchy ex-events' manager (well, there had to be one unfriendly person in town), and even a sexy but usually diffident newspaper editor. The mystery is reasonably convoluted (although you know the nice people who are accused can't possibly be guilty of the crime), the Yuletide atmosphere so Christmassy it will make you hear jingle bells and shiver against the chill, and personal attractions begun are continued.Readers of police procedurals and Nordic noir, take note: this isn't your bag, but if you're the type of person who likes cozies and Christmas, this book will be perfect for your holiday reading. It even ends up with a meal so luscious it will make you hungry, and some mistletoe.

"Sadly, Patterson passed away just weeks before this second part of his biography of Heinlein was published.Like the first volume, Patterson has filled the book with so many miniscule details of Robert Heinlein's later life (after his marriage to Virginia Gerstenfeld) that you wonder if he was a fly in the corner during the entire period of time. We follow the development of the Future History stories, go to Hollywood for the filming of DESTINATION MOON (whose fate was tied up with another movie about, believe it or not, a squirrel), build a home in Colorado and cope with fallout from Heinlein's ex-wife Leslyn, travel along with the Heinleins to Russia, Australia, and even Antarctica, observe the long development of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, understand Heinlein's support for blood drives after a transfusion saves his life, and finally follow his long slow slide into ill health as he aged. Patterson's approach seemed warmer in this volume and I didn't feel as if I was being held at arm's length as I was in the first half. Heinlein fans will definitely enjoy this concluding volume.

"This is one of four books in which naturalist Teale and his wife Nellie travel across the United States during one of the seasons and observe wildlife and ecosystems. While most fall volumes concentrate on leaf coloration and homely pursuits that include pumpkins, winter vegetables, and animals preparing for hibernation, the Teales' track starts in New England and then takes a meandering way westward through Michigan, the upper Plains states, dip down to the Great Salt Lake, go north to Oregon and end up in Northern California, both at the shore and inland, all done in the days before the interstate. They discover unique bird species, find the places where the butterflies stop over on their migrations, tour the redwood forests, view the autumn sky from a homemade sky-watching station, investigate the roamer of the plains (the tumbleweed), see migrating salmon, discover pikas and fern farmers, and even tell the story of a man's arduous multi-month search for his beloved dog lost in the wilderness. These books are a must for anyone who enjoys reading about wildlife and natural habitats, and there are great views of road travel before the superhighways. Like a virtual nature hike.

"I bought this for events like outdoor craft shows and festivals so I could stop and sit down when my husband took a break with his walker. I admit I hate carrying it around, but I hate carrying anything around.

"This is my second Bracketron purchase, the first having been from Radio Shack. I'm sorry to give poor Radio Shack even less business by not buying my replacement unit there, but really--$35 at Radio Shack, only $12 on Amazon? I'm saving for retirement here, guys, give me a break.Anyway, I like this unit because it works on my air vent rather than having it dangling from or standing on a suction cup. I know through bitter experience how quickly these suction cups lose their suction; I'm not risking breaking a $200 smartphone. I plug my phone into the power cord, wire it for sound, and while I'm using the GPS listen to podcasts or music. With a little finagling, it's just on the correct angle to see with a quick glance while you're driving. Using voice commands I can make a phone call without having to take my hands off the steering wheel. Waze guides me through traffic. Rick Steves keeps me entertained. I love my Bracketron.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7H3XJLAJ8ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B2PPYC#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7H3XJLAJ8ER","A2NLIB986TEESZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLIB986TEESZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this tablet to put on the stand of an exercise bike so I could watch Netflix and Amazon Prime and listen to my google music library while working out. I already have plenty of other devices for the more typical uses of a mobile device.In reality, this is probably a 4-star tablet, but I am giving it 5 stars, because it's unfair and counterproductive to hold it up against products costing three or four times as much, such as an iPad. It'd be like docking a Toyota Corolla a star for not being as nice as a BMW.I think I have a good frame of reference for judging the Lenovo, in that I am a long-time Android tablet user, with two Nexus tablets and a drawer full of Amazon devices in the house. As I type this review, I am sitting here with a Nexus next to the Lenovo. A new Nexus 10 is $450, against the Lenovo's $180. So let's keep that in mind: the Lenovo A10 is 40 % of the cost of a Nexus. With that said:- The only thing that seems hugely different and inferior to me about the Lenovo is the case. It is flimsy, flexible plastic and I would not want to test it with an accidental drop from arm height; I don't think it'd survive. It really does feel cheap. Then again, it IS cheap. If you're looking to carry it around and actually work on it (as opposed to what I'm doing, basically keeping it in one place, where it's not going to get banged around), I'd recommend a solid/hard cover or case.- The screen is very nice. Color saturation is too high for my tastes but others might like it. I don't think the screen is quite as sharp as the Nexus, but it's still light years ahead of the SD screens on other budget tablets. It's 1920x1080, not the 1200x800 ish resolution of most of the competition. BIG difference.- I see some complaints in the reviews about WiFi connection, but I have had no issues with this. WiFi has been very reliable, and there is no lag or stuttering while streaming movies.- I also see some complaints about the sound, but I don't share that view. I think the sound is quite good -- in fact, as good as the Nexus, and louder. I saw some reviews complaining about the volume being too low. Maybe they fixed that in between those reviews and my buying it, because mine seems plenty loud. It was kinda dumb of them to put the speakers on the rear of the unit, but actually, somehow those speakers manage to project enough clear sound to be enjoyable, even when the unit is resting flat against something that blocks them.- I haven't tested it hard, with multiple demanding apps running. For the basic stuff that 99 % of people would do with a tablet - watch some movies, do email, chat, surf - it seems adequate. Apps open pretty fast, things are smooth on screen, no real complaints. It certainly isn't as zippy and snappy as a Nexus, or iPad, or other high-end tablet. It's a bit slower. You can see it in the load times when opening an app or getting a new movie to start up, and so on. But it's a minor lag, not an annoyingly huge one.In all, I think Lenovo has put together a compelling little package: a tablet with mediocre (but not terrible) horsepower and low-end exterior casing, but with a very nice, large, true HD screen and good sound, for a truly rock-bottom price. I am giving it the full 5 stars because when you compare it to other tablets in its price range, it is truly a 5 star product. But I want to add the important caveat that in no way can it be compared to a $450 Nexus or an iPad or other high-end tablet. It is what it is, a budget tablet with a really nice, clear HD screen.Based on the research I did, the only serious competitor was Amazon's own Fire HD. I compared them side by side in a retail store, and frankly, the Fire HD felt nicer - better build quality, much nicer casing. For me, it came down to wanting a clean, true Android experience, instead of the Amazon OS. I'm just used to pure, undiluted Android, from using Nexus tablets -- for example, all of my purchased apps are in the Google Play store, which the Amazon OS can't access. If I was more of an Amazon content consumer / Kindle guy, I'd have probably gone with the Fire. I think the Fire is nicer to hold and look at. That said, there is a lot of criticism of the Fire as far as wifi, reliability, software crashing, slow, etc, whereas the Lenovo is providing a stock Android experience, which is pretty reliable and proven at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZ4Z30EM7MWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05L9Y#wasThisHelpful","RYZ4Z30EM7MWB","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this desktop about 3 weeks ago. It's extremely quiet - I can barely hear it at all. It's very intuitive and easy to set up. Works perfectly with my new HP 27"" monitor. I trust HP. I know that's kinda stupid, since all the tech companies are sourcing their gear from the same suppliers and pretty much the same near-slave laborers, but I've always had good luck with HP equipment. I've got the same smartphone, laptop, tablet, blah blah, as everyone else, but there is still something to be said for a big, beefy desktop tower with a gazillion USB 2.0 and 3.0 and other ports, plenty of expansion space for future needs, a wicked fast i7 processor, a decent graphics card, and all the rest of the goodies. I am a big fan of Win 7 and will be the last person to give up the ghost and switch over to an inferior new Microsoft product, and there aren't that many boxes out there still being sold with Win 7. I did a ton of research before settling on this Envy box. For folks new to HP as a possible solution to their gear needs, keep in mind that ENVY is their higher end box; Pavillion and just ""HP"" are the lower end. You want to spend the extra $150 or whatever to get the Envy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YV77CQE5D7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I1VWQW#wasThisHelpful","R6YV77CQE5D7G","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great little speaker for the money. I compared them side by side with a couple other cheapo PC speakers we have, and the sound was generally better. Tight, crisp highs, clear midrange, and considering the diminutive size, pretty good sounding bass. One thing I especially like about them is that they do not artificially color the sound too much to make up for the size; some small PC speakers have a kind of odd hollowed-out area in the mid range from either base enhancement or the engineers' effort to create too much wide stereo effect. These sound pretty flat, like the source audio is supposed to sound. Of COURSE you are not going to get the kind of bass or fullness of sound that you'd get out of a 2:1 setup or a larger speaker, so don't expect that. For casual Youtube, web surfing, and occasional music listening while you work, these are really, really good. Would they be satisfactory as your main music listening speakers? Come on, that is not what these are for. For that, you have to spend a lot more money, at least 3x the price. For this price, these are solid 5 stars. I do think these are most effective at low or medium listening levels, and their limitations show up as the volume is increased, as is going to be the case in any speaker of this size. So just to reiterate the point, these are for casual listening while you're working or surfing, not for hi-fidelity music appreciation or shaking the walls of the house. For their intended purpose, they are excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9QAC3GAOOQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028N6YH0#wasThisHelpful","R2F9QAC3GAOOQU","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly wasn't happy about spending so much money on cat litter, especially after all these years of spending $4 per huge bag for standard litter at the grocery store. But we've had a cat who for two years had been getting progressively less regular about urinating in the box. As the smell and mess of cat pee gradually took over our house, getting into the hardwood floors and all over our couches and bed, we lashed out in desperation with every possible thing we could think of. Nothing worked. As we contemplated taking the kitty to the vet for antidepressants or something, my wife took a last look around the web for yet-another-thing we could try. And she stumbled onto this product.Bottom line: it works. We've been using it for about a month, and during that time, there has only been one minor ""incident"", easily cleaned up, on about the 4th day. So maybe the feline wasn't yet fully with the program. Since then, she has been, 100 %.Do I despise spending so much money on what is probably $4/bag cat litter with a little catnip thrown in? Yes, yes I do. About as much as I regret not coming up with such brilliant business idea. Nevertheless, the stuff *does* work and it's saving a whole house worth of furniture and floors, and we no longer wake up every morning wondering what part of the house we have to go clean.Totally works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37D8XC4X2KCQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009X49IC#wasThisHelpful","R37D8XC4X2KCQ2","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great product, and it really does work. I use it for Achilles issues, and it makes a difference. Plus, unlike a brace or heel lifts and what not, you can wear the tape all day long and get continuous relief. The website says you can wear it in the shower, and while true (it does stay on) it tends to stay a little wet and does get uncomfortable. Also, I do get some rash from the tape, especially if it gets wet.

"Very effective product for Achilles problems, either as a stand-alone solution, or in combination with other solutions such as KT tape and heel lifts. I have moderate chronic Achilles tendonitis which can be very difficult to get under control, especially with any kind of exercise. I started with the CEP brace, and it did a lot of good - immediately, like, within 20 minutes. It isn't really intended to be used when not active; it should be used during exercise (walking, jogging, etc). I didn't find that it was 100 % solving my Achilles tendonitis and read some other reviews where people had combined it with KT tape. For me, that turned out to be a great combination, and now I always use the two together when working out. If I add heel lifts to those two items, I can usually get a pain free workout - though stacking 3 different products on the ankle/heel is not totally conducive to comfort. All in all, I think this admittedly expensive product delivers on its promise, and is well worth checking out if you have Achilles issues. It's at least as useful as any of the exorbitantly expensive products peddled by podiatrists and physical therapists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZPZS7VA03DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LCPA3Y#wasThisHelpful","RNZPZS7VA03DA","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This awesome cleaning brush is the Final Word Ever on grill cleaning brushes. I grill 4-5 times per week and am psychotically picky about my grill tools. I don't even let other people use them. Normally, I buy and use whatever the highest-end Weber tool is for the purpose (tongs, spatula, etc). Weber does make a good grill brush, by the way. But of course, no grill brush gets in between the grill slats, right? Wrong. The Kona 360 Clean Grill Brush lets you get right in there, into those little spaces between the iron grates. It's such a clever design I wish I had thought of it myself. Kind of like if they came out with a shower sponge that surrounds your entire body and scrubs you clean, all at once, except applied to grills. And so, the first-ever non-Weber tool joins its Weber brethren on my grill hooks. The search is over. Best-in-class product, by a wide margin. No reason to buy any other grill brush again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32BAGST659VWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPAE1JW#wasThisHelpful","R32BAGST659VWB","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I switched over from an iPhone to the Android world 2 1/2 years ago with the Samsung Galaxy 3, and happily used and enjoyed it until it died a week ago. I was stunned when I visited the AT&T store to see how much they had improved things since then, and purchased a new Galaxy 6. However, I did spend some time fondling the Note 4 while in the store, and a few days later returned the Galaxy 6 for a Note 4. (I did look at the iPhone 6 and 6+, but for some reason iPhones just don't do it for me - I much prefer Android, even though I'm not a tekkie).The main difference and issue between the Galaxy 6 and Note 4, of course, is size: 5.1 "" screen vs 5.7"". While the Galaxy 6 is truly a one-handed phone, the Note 4 is only marginally capable of being operated in traditional one-hand smartphone style. Really, it is more of a tablet, in terms of how you handle it. On the other hand, after about 3-4 days of usage, I've gotten used to it. I also haven't used my Nexus 7 tablet since taking the Note 4 home; in fact I'm not even sure where it is right now. For me, being able to reduce from 2 to 1 devices for everyday carry, Starbucks hanging out, etc., is a huge benefit, and more than makes up for the fact that the Note 4 is a bit large to carry around all the time.The screen is AMAZING. So is the camera. The picture quality, displayed on this best-in-class screen, is nothing short of breathtaking. This phone truly takes everything to the next level (except audio - the small rear speaker is oddly cheesy and downmarket for this extremely expensive and premium phone).I could go over the details, but many others have done a fine job of describing the various points in other reviews here. I think my point is just that this is a fantastic phablet. News reading, book reading and such are all fairly easy on this device; Netflix watching is superb; gaming is not bad. Call quality is outstanding. It just upgraded to Android 5.0.1, which has some really nice new features (such as centralized notifications management for all applications in one place).If you want a really large phone that doubles as a small tablet, look no further. If you're intrigued by the concept but want something that fits more easily in a pocket and hand, a Galaxy 6 might be the better choice. I can see the merit in both arguments. That said, having owned both I'm very happy with the Note 4 and plan on keeping it for a full 2 years. I think once you get used to this kind of screen real estate and power in your pocket, it's hard to go back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDXKZ43WBHWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N532FRU#wasThisHelpful","R2WDXKZ43WBHWO","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If the phone is sitting vertically, then the slightest breeze or touch will send it toppling over.

"A great product which I recommend with no reservations. I don't use the Dunham Cloud boots for hard-core backpacking/hiking but just to tool around town, walk, etc. For that purpose, they're great! They fit and feel much like my various New Balance shoes (Dunham is a New Balance brand). One thing about Dunham and New Balance is that the sizing is almost always consistent across the brands and different models, so once you're set on a certain size/width, you're set. I returned some Timberland boots because they were too narrow and just not that comfortable - a little tight. These are the opposite - massively roomy toe box and roomy, spacious interior from toes to heel. I really like that about them. My sense is that, overall quality wise, these are a cut or two above other similar boots at this approximate price point, making them a good (though not inexpensive) deal. No boots are ever as comfortable as shoes, but these come reasonably close.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYMYUOH9LLIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JVWOLG#wasThisHelpful","R3JYMYUOH9LLIC","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great shoes. They are comfortable, roomy, supportive (with excellent arch support), and stable. I got them for fitness walking, but they quickly replaced pretty much all my other shoes for going outside for any purpose. No, they're not quite ""high fashion"", but they're reasonably attractive casual-wear for anything from a weekend to a casual office environment. The 928's are really the gold standard for higher-end walking shoes or for people who are on their feet all day; I'm not sure there's anything better out there. I like them so much I already bought a pair in both colors and a back up pair in brown. They are so much more comfortable than other shoes, especially if you're going to be standing or walking a lot, that it's hard to describe. One thing worth noting is that they're not heavily padded; the feel is more ""supportive"" than ""springy"". Kind of like sleeping on a firm or medium-firm mattress instead of a cushy soft one. These are not cheap, but you get what you pay for; the build quality is high and attention to detail is solid. I'm very satisfied and, at least as of right now, don't see myself wearing much of anything else shoe-wise in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204RSRXICOFNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JTW8SC#wasThisHelpful","R204RSRXICOFNW","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is so much misinformation on the web from disgruntled iFit users that I feel compelled to weigh in. Speaking of weighing in, I've been losing 2.5 pounds per week consistently since getting it. Anyway ...Here is, in a nutshell, what iFit does, assuming you have an iFit enabled exercise machine (basically, those made by Icon Fitness, which includes brands such as NordicTrack, Pro-Form, etc.):- create custom maps using Google Maps on your laptop, send them to your exercise machine, and then run/walk/cycle along to Google Street Views - anyplace in the world. Today I took a tour of Stonehenge, and yesterday I walked along a river in Australia. On my treadmill. How cool is that? The incline/decline on your machine adjusts automatically to track to the topography of the Google Map - so as you walk up a hill on the map, your machine adjusts accordingly. There are hundreds of maps provided by iFit if you don't feel like making your own. And there are THOUSANDS created by other users that you can tap into; the sharing between members is extensive. One member has created a massive database of 1,200 maps, fully searchable for location (by country), type (beaches, trails, cities, etc), hilliness, distance, etc. The Google Maps thing is absolutely the coolest fitness concept I've ever seen, and it may be the flagship feature of iFit, but it's not the only feature. There is much more:- download iFit Outside to your phone, go for a run/walk, and it'll use GPS to create a Google Map of your run/walk. It'll immediately upload the data to your iFit account, including the map, time, elevations, speed, pace, calories, etc. You can log into your account at the iFit site and review the map and every detail of your workout. As it does with a treadmill (or other equipment) workout, iFit logs all the data from your outdoor workout and adds it to your accumulating totals.- every workout you do on your exercise equipment is automatically uploaded to iFit after you complete it - all the data: time, distance, elevation, heart rate (if you're using a chest strap), etc. It's all reviewable on graphs and charts, and iFit totals it by day/week/month and forever, so you can monitor progress and see your accumulating totals. I have used the graphs showing heart rate overlayed with incline level and speed to great effect, learning how and where I can push harder to get improved cardiovascular fitness, and I have been able to see my results improve by the week on the charts.- you can log your weight, food/calories, etc. I'm not personally a fan of calorie or weight logging, but weight logging does serve an important purpose in iFit. If you log your weight, iFit will automatically use it to calculate the calories for your workouts on your machine - or even your outdoor walks/runs. This will provide you an infinitely more accurate picture of calories burned than any kind of generic formula.- any workout you do on your machine is stored forever in iFit so you can repeat it anytime- iFit displays pretty much every piece of data you can think of on your machine as you work out. It is the most comprehensive data-display I've ever seen on a fitness machine. There's nothing you'll want to know about your workout that isn't displayed on the iFit panel. Speed, pace, incline %, heart rate, calories/hour rate, distance, distance remaining to complete workout, and on and on and on.- you can set goals on the iFit site and it'll track your progress against those goals, alerting you to where you're falling short and prodding you to improve where needed.- it has social features (forum, blog, etc) for people who are into that kind of thing.So basically, it's a total system which integrates your exercise equipment, the iFit web site, and your outdoor exercise activities.But still, the Google Street View thingy is the most amazing feature and is itself worth the ticket to the dance.Now, about the complaints. Sadly, iFit is a bit buggy. One weekend it was basically not working at all for me, and I've noticed a wide assortment of minor annoyances, from workouts that aren't logged 100 % accurately, to the fact that it knocks 2-3 calories and 2-3 seconds off my workout totals (sounds minor, sure, but I do one-hour workouts only to see it logged as 59:57, which is annoying, so now I do 60:03 workouts). Occasionally iFit workouts don't log at all, and though you can always enter them manually (by typing in the time, distance, calories, etc., as they appeared on your machine after the workout), it's just not the same as having the machine take care of all of it for you. In short, iFit is more than a Beta product but something less than a fully debugged, rock-solid application. iFit needs better system testing. probably more programmers, and somewhat more of a customer-focused commitment to proactive bug and problem fixes. Having gotten to know quite a few iFit users, some of them have had great experiences like me, but others have encountered more substantial and/or persistent problems and been frustrated by the buggy nature of the system. Everything has worked about 95 % for me, but even as a satisfied and impressed end-user I can see that iFit has work to do to elevate this from ""cool idea that kinda works most of the time"" to a truly reliable, stable service.Some of the complaints about iFit are flat-out wrong. For instance, the complaint that once you join, you then have to pay to download specific map packages. That is wrong. I have downloaded hundreds of iFit maps and workout collections, and have never been charged one cent. It's all free, once you're a premium member, at least for anything that I've downloaded.There's really nothing else like iFit, or even close to it, on the market. Put simply, it is the ONLY fitness system that lets you walk, run or cycle anywhere on Planet Earth from the comfort of your own house, getting in shape while seeing the world - from their or your own custom Google Street View maps. That is just brilliant. And as noted earlier, there's a lot to iFit besides the Google Street View feature. Integration of an exercise machine with outdoor exercise and the web into one overall tracking system for fitness is really, really helpful, and probably more important than the Google maps for getting and staying on track.I can understand why some people are frustrated with iFit, but I encourage people looking into iFit to consider the forest for the trees. It is a brilliant fitness system. Like a lot of iFit users, I am waiting for them to put the resources on this to make it 100 % stable and polished, but in the meantime, even with its quirks and annoyances it's a truly unique and excellent platform for getting in shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HJVEZTAHO4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPS8ZB2#wasThisHelpful","R14HJVEZTAHO4A","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Solid laptop for the price. Core i3 chip and 500 meg drive is more than sufficient for basic work/entertainment computing; it isn't a gaming machine, of course. The 17"" monitor is crisp and bright. Keyboard feels a little un-springy but is otherwise fine. The mouse button isn't great: instead of two buttons, you get one long bar, and have to push at the very ends of the bar to get a left or right click. Also, the touchpad is far to the left side of the laptop, instead of in the middle, where it should be. A big upside is that it ships with Windows 7 home premium, instead of the odious Windows 8. Overall, it's a solid value-laptop for people who don't want to spend a lot of money but want all the basics: large screen, an Intel Core processor, and Windows 7.

"I use this shoe (and *only* this shoe) on the treadmill. I had previously been using the 860v4 but then got the 860v5 and it's even better. The new version has a strong plastic mid-sole arch support that really provides a lot of support, which was absent on the v4.  It's well worth the higher cost to get the arch support, but the shoe is lighter, too. This shoe provides the perfect amount of padding and support and fits fantastically well on my feet. It provides ample space for the foot and is a bit on the roomier side, compared to some other running shoes. This is as comfortable a shoe as I've ever worn.

"This is a tremendous product, as fit for purpose as a product could possibly be. There are some better headphones out there in terms of audio quality, but for noise cancellation, nothing even comes close to the Bose 25s. I had the Sony equivalent, which were about 2/3 of the cost (hence my purchase of the Sonys), and they were NOTHING compared to the Bose for noise cancellation. In addition, the QC25s are extremely comfortable for my large head and ears, and I can wear them as long as needed with no fatigue. I use the QC25s to work out on a treadmill and watch a small TV while my wife uses a rowing machine and watches the main room TV at full volume. With any other headphones, or even with the QC25s and noise cancellation turned off, it's a cacophonous madhouse - a giant TV blasting, exercise equipment and fans running, etc. - I can barely hear my own TV at all no matter how loud I turn it up. But when I turn on the noise cancellation, almost all of the noise in the room just ... disappears, and I can comfortably listen to my own TV show at a low volume. It doesn't eliminate ""all"" background noise; for example, you can still hear voices and some higher-pitched sounds. But it almost entirely eliminates low frequency noise, background hum, buzz, fans, and other constant/ambient sounds. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal. The price seems ridiculous, but they are worth every penny if you can afford them. In case it's ambiguous, just to be clear I ***love*** this product.I wouldn't even consider getting on a plane without these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345JPP9KB7VU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1NEUKK#wasThisHelpful","R345JPP9KB7VU6","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A useful, informative and often insightful book about the lead up to the Battle of Hastings, the major players involved, and the battle itself. Tetlow fills in a lot of blank spots in the history, with interesting and informative speculation, making the story into more of an overall narrative than the raw history would provide.That said, the book has some historical inaccuracies. Simple example: Tostig Godwinson is said to have been Earl of Northumbria for a year, whereas no one questions that he had been Earl for 10 years prior to his exile.Except for some errors of that nature and questionable accounting of force sizes at the various battles, Tetlow does a good job of distinguishing fact from speculation from probable falsehood.Given the enormity of the 1066 story in western history, there aren't really a lot of books that focus on that one year. Most Conquest books spend the first third on the earlier background (Edward the Confessor's reign), a third on 1066, and a third on the post-Conquest situation of William ruling England. Those are useful too, and the more one understands the previous King Edward's reign, the better one can follow and appreciate what happened in 1066. Indeed, in a lot of ways 1066 was the final outcome of political and historical developments that had occurred years earlier. That said, it is good that there's a book that, although it does cover the previous years briefly, really drills down on 1066 itself, devoting time and patience to dissecting the specific events of the year. Good balance of political vs. battlefield coverage.Every 1066 book has a bias one way or the other, and this one is slightly (but not overly) biased toward the English (versus the Normans). Tetlow takes a properly skeptical opinion toward the Bayeux Tapestry, the propaganda of William of Poitiers (which fed most of what we think we know about 1066), etc.The book does fall a little flat in its coverage of Harold's brother Tostig Godwinson. His cruelty and maladministration is covered in depth, but his motivations are not, leaving him a cardboard monster instead of the complex person that he probably was. There are other books that provide a more nuanced view of Tostig.I've read pretty much every book on 1066, and this is one of the better ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB5K292DQD8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594160643#wasThisHelpful","R1OB5K292DQD8Q","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well made. Reasonable price. Between the two sizes, I'd probably recommend the 51 oz one. They have the same footprint on a table; the 51 oz version is just taller. So it holds 50 % more coffee while taking up no more space on a table or desk. The 34 oz one is small and is smaller than it looks in the picture - really not much larger than an 18 ounce cup of coffee.

"If 1/3 of the words were removed, I think this'd have been an excellent book. It has an interesting, intriguing premise and a fun story. But it is exceptionally wordy. Once I figured out that you could skim or skip entire chunks of text (4-5 pages at some points) and lose not a shred of the plot/story, it got better, but it was still a struggle to make it to the end. The wordiness problem occurs on two levels: (a) just generally taking 200 words to say something that could've been said in 10, and (b) a really onerous attempt to make the reader feel the fear, through incredibly repetitive long, drawn-out descriptions of the main character's fearful emotional responses to things. For those who are either very patient or proficient at skimming, buried in this book is a solid, fun story. The beginning is better than the end; the early characterizations make for worthwhile reading, while the characters in the last half of the book turn to cardboard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FHIAW6YNF8TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425218643#wasThisHelpful","R3FHIAW6YNF8TQ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something silly and depressing, and yet useful, about a book like this. It does exactly what you'd expect it to do: convert history's most masterful prose into garbage modern idiomatic English. Some of that is so comical that you'll find yourself sending snippets to your friends by email for days, and they will write back, ""LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL"". You'll feel guilty for reading it, and you may end up wondering whether you have just aided a wee bit in the general collapse of western civilization.All that said, I'm really glad I purchased it. Shakespeare is hard to read. Some of the archaic language can be sussed out with patience, but some of it is impenetrable. The real prose appears on the left side, and the ... for lack of a better word ... ""translation"" appear on the right (facing) pages. Nobody's stopping you from reading the real prose on the left pages and ignoring the modernized version. But when you hit those words and phrases that can't be sussed out, a quick glance at the right-hand page leaves you with an ""ah, I get it now"".It's a very useful tool that I wish wasn't necessary but found very beneficial. And when all is said and done, it got me re-exploring Shakespeare, and I'll probably buy others in the series, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F10BQHADNXYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586638467#wasThisHelpful","R2F10BQHADNXYQ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About two years ago I decided to teach myself Old English. It has been quite a difficult journey, because while there are some shared words and similarities between old and new (modern) English, the truth is that Old English is, to us, a foreign language. The grammar is way, way different than modern English, and once you get done learning the few hundred words that are similar or identical (gold, God, etc.) and congratulating yourself for being able to say ""Hello! My name is Bob and I am hungry and I live in England"" in Old English, you end up here: ""willath hy hine athecgan gif he on preat cymeth."" And at that point you realize that the complex Old English training/learning materials out there are far too overwhelming for the average adult learner to deal with.This book is the antidote. It is VERY easy to understand and digest in manageable chunks, and literally from Page 1 you get a sense that you're making progress and learning how to read Old English sentences. The language study is combined with useful cultural tidbits, and the book covers things that, in retrospect, seem blindingly obvious but that other books fail to cover -- such as the fact that the written letters of Old English don't all look like our letters; no matter how hard and how much you memorize verb tables, you will not be able to read the simplest ""real"" Old English text until you learn to recognize how they wrote their s, r, and g's. And especially the w's, which were called wynns and looked like thin, squashed p's. I learned that on about page 10 of this book, and it quickly informed me as to why, after managing to get the basic gist of the language in my head, I had still been unable to read a SINGLE word in an actual handwritten Old English document. Well, now I can. It isn't that difficult.The book will not fully prepare you for reading Old English texts; it is more like a primer that will get you launched in the right direction. To read the Seafarer or Beowulf in original Old English, you'll need to take it further than this book. There are plenty of other books that can help you do that, once you've got the basics down.Although superficially aimed at children, in point of fact it is a brilliant exercise in adult learning. I would go as far as to say that this book is the most ingenious piece of adult learning material I have ever encountered on any topic. It is simply flawless at getting a newbie engaged with its topic.Very sadly, I heard that the author Matt Love has passed away, so I guess we will not be seeing the additional volumes which were planned for this series. My understanding is that many more volumes were planned, and one can only imagine how they would have propelled the adult learner to mastery of this difficult subject matter.

"This is quite a good book for income-oriented investors, that is, people who are primarily seeking high yields to deal with the extreme low-interest-rate environment we've been in for a half decade now. The main thrust of the book is that:- it is possible to earn a reasonable rate of return of 3x (but in many cases much more, even though the author doesn't really say that) times the rate offered by bank CDs.- however, you must be SMART about how you pick these investments, because many of them suck- you can apply a methodology to find the good ones, which is really what the book focuses on.Without going further than reading the book (the author offers a stock picking/identifying service online) I was able to choose a number of investments that have been performing well. They are averaging an 8.5 % yield, which is much, much more than 3x CD rates. They don't all fully meet the author's guidelines, but I wanted more yield. If nothing else, the book forces you to examine what risks you're willing to take and how far off the path to low-risk success you're willing to go to jack up that yield just a little more.I notice that a few reviewers criticize the book for being basically a brochure for his online service. It's possibly a fair critique but I didn't really feel that way. He's packed a lot of thoughtful ideas and good ways to look at income investing into an inexpensive paperback. If you want more in-depth guidance, you have to pay for it, just like with anything else. The book itself is a great value.I liked the book and would recommend checking it out if you're seeking high-yield income investing ideas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y4WSNSAIERQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601451636#wasThisHelpful","R2Y4WSNSAIERQN","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 3rd Safariland glock holster. I really like this product line. The Glock 21 is large and not that easy to find a good holster for. In this particular holster, the G21 is held very securely (but not too tight for me, as some other reviewers have complained about). I have not had an issue with the holster rubbing against the front sight, also a complaint of some reviewers. The two big advantages of this holster (for any Glock model) are that the kydex is very tough and thick and completely covers the trigger guard - a huge plus for any gun without a safety, such as a Glock - and the ""unlock"" mechanism to get the gun out of the holster is very intuitive and easy. You can get the gun out fast, but no one can easily grab the gun off your holster. For these reasons, I rate the product 5 stars.  Of course, it goes without saying that a G21 is not an easy gun to conceal and I would therefore not even think about this holster as a ""concealment holster"". To me, it's an open carry / range holster only. I suppose if you had a large sweater, loose pants, and a jacket, you could do it, but realistically, there are much more suitable firearms for that task.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNPSMZMRPGX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U43C1U#wasThisHelpful","RWNPSMZMRPGX3","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who are into historical source documents and English history, it'd be very, very hard to beat this one. Henry of Huntingdon was not an eyewitness to the Norman conquest and surrounding decades (he was born 22 years after the battle of Hastings) but he was close enough in time to the action to give you a more visceral, detailed, up-close-and-personal account of the action than is available pretty much anywhere else.There are some (including the introduction in this book) who point out that this isn't ""historical analysis"" in the way we understand it these days. In the 11th century, history was more of a rhetorical art, with fake (made-up) speeches intending to communicate how the author imagined the main characters' thought processes, and so forth. However, I found that it was actually a pretty straightforward historical work, minus the tedious ""and the English lost because they had failed God"" type of stuff, which is endemic to any period writing. They just had a very different view of the role of God in the everyday happenings of man, than we do. It's easy to find historical errors in his work, but he did not have Google, Wikipedia and a modern, large body of historical books on the subject available to him. Constructing his history from hearsay, scant source documents, and passed-down oral history, it's remarkable how well his history squares with the known facts and other contemporary-ish sources. As he himself points out, once the book gets to his era, that is, roughly 1100 and later, the history-telling is much more based on his own observations, and it shows; it becomes more personal, fact-based and confident in its assertions.The only criticism I am going to level at this book is that the footnoting is terrible. Why, oh why, oh WHY, did they not put the footnotes, which often contain the most important and interesting information, directly on the pages where they are referenced? And, OK, if one has to put them at the back of the book, fine. But why use asterisks instead of numbers to reference the footnotes?

"I really like what they've done with this mag pouch. Very handy at the range and, though I don't really expect to ever have to ""deploy"" it except in a range/practice setting, it's nice to know I can put a mag in the 21 and have three on my belt if I ever needed to.

"I haven't used it yet, and hope never to have to do so. But I did examine the unit and it appears to be of excellent quality. I especially like that it holds 100 gallons, versus some competitive products that are more in the 60 to 85 gallon range.

"When I got this thing, I almost laughed out loud at how much stuff they packed into it. Solar panel and hand crank for power generation. AM/FM radio. Flashlight. Emergency beacon. Alarm. USB port for charging a cell phone. I wish I had been on the design team - that would've been a lot of fun.

Period.I do have a higher end version of this type of device, which was more than twice as expensive. It's more rugged than this one, and has a few feature this doesn't (but no beacon). So, if you want one of these for general emergency preparedness, this is not the only option you have.

"Not to be unoriginal, but I completely agree with an earlier reviewer who said this is as rare and magical as unicorn blood. Couldn't have said it better myself. More prosaically, I'll add that this is the best hot sauce I have ever used - out of hundreds. Not too vinegary, not too sweet, not too salty*, and it has the perfect heat level (maybe a smidge too hot for non-chili-heads, but for hot sauce lovers it hits that perfect, perfect, perfect ""medium heat"" -- some burn, no pain but not bland either).* Actually, there is one hot sauce that tastes even better than this one, Belizean Heat. That one is absolutely the best tasting hot sauce in the history of the universe. (And they are both from Belize ... hmm, must have good habaneros there).  However, Belizean Heat has 410 mg of salt PER TEASPOON, making it pretty much bottled salt. Sontava is less than half of that. So, on pure consideration of flavor alone, I'd probably give the nod to Belizean Heat, but considering everything overall, inclusive of health implications, Sontava is the top choice.I buy this stuff in 12 packs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YAFE1UGPBUTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SAW7FM#wasThisHelpful","R2YAFE1UGPBUTN","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this small keyboard. I got it so I could futz around and make some music on my laptop, when I wasn't in my office/music studio. And it's perfect for that application. It is truly plug-and-play: I plugged the USB cable into my laptop, and seconds later, it was recognized and available to my DAW (Digital Performer 8) as a midi input device. They keys feel like every other synth-action keybed I've used; as a piano player I don't love that weightless, plastic feel, but that is what is out there for this kind of price point. I do REALLY like the overall dimensions of this unit. By eliminating unnecessary knobs at the top and sticking to just the basics on the left side (mod wheel, one midi CC controller), it's very easy to toss this thing around, put it in front of a laptop, etc. I specifically wanted a midi keyboard that didn't have all those sliders and complicated mappings and so forth, and this one delivers.

"It is painful to give this item a 2-star review, but ... so be it. This $500 and change chandelier is absolutely magnificent and you are sure to get nods and whispers of approval and jealousy from your neighbors and friends. It is perfect for a 6 - 7 foot long table. BUT ... ours arrived misaligned. It was impossible to fix. We had to rig it with spacers picked up from Home Depot to make it level and straight. My feeling is that for $100 or $150, you expect to maybe get a lighting fixture with a small problem, but for $500 it should be PERFECT. It was not. And I'm not talking about a little bend; I'm talking about a fundamentally misshapen piece of metal that created a massive nightmare installation project. That upside-down-U shaped bracket which holds the 6 lights? Ours was lower on one side, so that the six lights tilted about 10 degrees down on one side (and up on the other).

"This isn't the midi controller a major studio would choose, but for those of us recording in homes or small project studios, it is a very nice piece of gear and a great value.It's plug and play, for the most part. I attached the USB cable and was getting sounds out of my apps of choice (Kontakt 5 / Digital Performer 8 on a Windows 7 machine) in about 10 seconds, but it took longer to get the non-keyboard controls (sliders and knobs) set up properly. It's worth noting that the sliders and knobs feel EXCELLENT and punch way above their weight for the price.The keyboard keys are standard cheapo synth keys; I don't love 'em but I don't hate 'em either. It would be nice if this unit was offered in a slightly more expensive version with semi-weighted keys, but there is nothing wrong with this keybed. The velocity curve out of the box is kinda weird; you have to hit the notes HARD to get volume out of them, or even to get them to sound at all. No biggie for the white keys, but it is difficult to engage the black keys hard enough, and you tend to fire a lot of blanks in fast passages. Adjusting the velocity curve to a higher setting definitely helps with the problem -- but takes some digging around in the manual, and leaves you with less dynamic range to work with.The LX61 is light and easy to toss around from desk to wherever; it only weighs about 9 pounds.I could nitpick about this-and-that, but for $200 it's a steal and I'm not complaining. It feels good, with high quality sliders and knobs. It looks good, too. It took a little futzing with the manual and knobs to get it set up right, but pretty much all midi controllers are like that.I struggled with whether to get the 49 or 61; I think either'd be fine. I chose the 61 because it doesn't take up a lot more space and offers a bit more usefulness. The 61 is only 38 "" long, which fits easily on almost any desk. But if I didn't plan to play two-handed piano pieces on it, I probably would've bought the 49.Recommended product - but be prepared to spend a little while with the manual to get the most out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7TVY77HDKWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDBR0SK#wasThisHelpful","R2L7TVY77HDKWK","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Native Instruments products piecemeal since around 2006, and recently decided to take the plunge and upgrade to Komplete 9.Native Instruments might be best understood as the Google of music plug ins: an ambitious, creative company with a sprawling product line which includes a market-proven, best-in-class flagship product (Google Search; Native Instruments Kontakt); some off-the-wall experimental stuff that's cutting edge but maybe not of much use to most people yet(Google's driverless cars; NI's Reaktor), and, in the middle, a whole slew of product lines that range in success from ""OK"" to, occasionally, ""superb"" (Google Drive, Google Maps, etc. ; Native Instruments' dozens of synthesizers, virtual instruments, effects, etc).Komplete 9 is sort of like the experience you get when you go ""full Google"" - logging into Gmail and then using  Youtube, Gmail, Google calendar, Google contacts, Google+, etc. Some people love the integration even if some of the individual products aren't best-in-class, some don't value that, and some resent becoming part of a vendor's collective hive. I think this accurately sums up how people express themselves about Native Instruments on discussion boards. I for one like being part of the Google hive and I also like having the comprehensive Komplete platform to make music. Like any ""Total Solution"", not every single component of Komplete is a market-leader, but enough parts of it are to make it worthwhile as the main platform in your computer-based studio.I paid $400 for Kontakt in 2007, $200 for Battery, and $200 for Massive ... and I thought those were fair prices for the quality and depth of the apps. Komplete 9 includes those three apps, plus the two highly regarded soft-synths Absynth and FM8, plus Reaktor (more on these, later). Komplete also includes some two dozen instruments and effects sets that work within those apps. All of that for $500. It's an absolute steal, an incredible, mind-boggling amount of apps, content, and sound libraries for the buck. It would cost THOUSANDS to replicate all of the functionality and content in Komplete by purchasing it piecemeal from other vendors. The Kontakt library has over 1,000 usable, good to excellent musical instruments and sound samples you can drop right into your tracks, and that is just one piece of Komplete 9. I cannot overstate how much solid, basic value is packed into Komplete.As noted, all of the content is at least good, though not all of it is best in class. Let's take a look, from best to worst:- Kontakt is the best sampler/sample player/library on the market, period. With Kontakt, you can be lazy and just use it as a solid B or B+ instrument library, or you can go deep and spend the next three months learning how it works and then do very serious sound design work -- your choice; Kontakt is agnostic about what you do with it and will comply with whatever you want from it. The stock library is good enough to start making music, but the magic of Kontakt is that you can keep adding sound libraries to it until it is exactly what you need it to be, although that does cost money. A lot of people just pull up the presets in Kontakt and there's nothing wrong with that; in fact it's great fun, and pretty much destroys any need for outboard sound modules. But the thing to understand is that if you're willing to get under the hood, you'll find goodies like a high quality convolution reverb, dozens of other effects, and ... well, it'd take days to describe what you can do with Kontakt once you get beyond hitting the presets. Of special note is the New York Piano, which seems to be a sampled Steinway concert grand. It's phenomenal. Fits into any mix and is a blast to play solo. It gives you most of what you'd get from a top piano instrument such as Synthology's Ivory. But Ivory is 3/4 of the cost not of this piano but of the entire Kontakt 9 package !!!! So that's a really, really good example of the incredible value packed into Komplete 9.- Absynth, Massive, and FM8 are some of the best soft-synths on the market; just the presets on these tools are enough to cover 99 % of what you'd need from a synthesizer, especially the brilliant FM8 presets.  Over the years people have been very happy to pony up the money to buy those apps individually, and now they're tossed in the box for, basically, free. Massive is extremely easy and entertaining to program, and can be learned in a few hours. Absynth and FM8 are harder to learn, and I tend to just punch in presets on those two. Again: the FM8 presets are just stunning.- Monark is a new MiniMoog synth which is fully competitive with the best MiniMoog emulation synths out there -- I know, because I own all of them. It's not better, but it is as good, and, again, it's basically free.- Battery, NI's drum sampler/library, is a very solid program that, though not quite on the level of the best VI drums out there, is a program I've always liked and enjoyed using. Battery is not an A product but is perfectly acceptable. It has taken a turn in this new version toward hip hop and electronic sounds, as opposed to clean drums, which was a bit disappointing to me, but the Kontakt core library now includes a few outstanding acoustic drum kits to make up the difference.- Komplete now comes with a lot of effect plug ins. They're not thrilling but they get the job done. I would say their quality falls somewhere in the middle between the stock plug ins that come with a DAW, and high-end plugins from companies that really specialize in, say, reverb or compressors. If you have the budget for serious effects plug ins you can do better than what's bundled with Komplete, but if you're relying on your DAW's effects, Komplete provides a nice step up.- Guitar Rig 5 is an amp simulation program that I don't think is as good as the competition but is serviceable and will mostly get the job done when you're trying to get realistic guitar sounds into your tracks. I'm not in love with most of the sounds but I do love the user interface and overall useability. 1K Multimedia makes a better guitar amp simulator (Amplitube), but it's much more complex, costs tons compared to the bundled Guitar Rig, chews through CPU like a chew-toy, and it is very difficult to deal with that company for support if there's ever a problem. My advice would be to start with GR5, see how far it gets you, and then maybe take a look around for alternatives ... or find a way to love it.- Reaktor: this is a special case that defies ""good or bad"" analysis. Reaktor is a very complex program which is difficult to understand. Basically, it contains modules that you use to create your own synthesizers. It's sort of like a lego set for music creation programs - a high-level programming language for building soft-synths. The learning curve is very steep, and I can't imagine most musicians would try to get beyond the presets with Reaktor; I know I didn't. Nevertheless, it's a powerful tool for those with programming chops. NI itself and many other folks have created impressive instruments in Reaktor: the excellent synthesizer Monark is one of them. Reaktor is a nice-to-have, not something I'd have bought on its own, but good to have in the arsenal, especially for when NI or others release cool new presets like Monark.To take an extreme view of what Komplete can do for you, consider that with Komplete, the DAW program REAPER for $100 to record your tracks, and a $200 midi controller, you can make professional-grade music in your house for $800. Or, you can up the ante a tad and pick up iZotope's Ozone for $200 and then you will be able to do your own mastering and produce truly finished pro-level music, for $1,000. Of course you will still need a mic and an audio interface, and maybe you'll want a few pro-grade plugins for EQ, reverb, and compression, but you get the idea. For about $1,500 you can have it ALL. That is what Native Instruments has made possible, a world where pretty much anyone can have all of the functionality of a recording studio for $1,500 or thereabouts. Of course, Komplete does not include the talent to make great music; that, the user must provide.Big thumbs up for Native Instruments, and my highest possible endorsement for Komplete 9, a truly deep product with layers and layers of stuff to explore, learn and use, at an incredibly reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72J2M2NX6BMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSB47ZE#wasThisHelpful","R72J2M2NX6BMJ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got a WaterRower about a month ago, to replace an old elliptical machine we'd had for 12 years. The elliptical was a good machine, but was taking a toll on my back. We looked at different rowing machines, but settled on the WaterRower, mainly due to the reduced noise and the pleasant swoosh of water while rowing. It's also a great looking machine, probably the nicest looking piece of exercise equipment I've ever seen. Perhaps to an Olympian or serious competitive athlete that would be an unimportant or even silly purchasing criteria, but for normal, everyday people looking to get in shape without turning a large room in their house into a ""gym"", the WaterRower really is an aesthetically pleasing piece of kit.Rowing is quite challenging, in fact more challenging than any other aerobic machine or workout I've tried. For the first week, I could only go about 4 minutes in total each day, with breaks every 40 - 45 seconds (although I could still do 20-30 minutes on the elliptical!). I had gotten very out of shape, and rowing is unforgiving on out-of-shape muscles. It was brutal. It took about two full weeks for me to get broken in on the machine and to be able to do a full kilometer of rowing (roughly 8 minutes), still with a break every minute or two. Now I am able to do 2 kilometers (in about 14 minutes) with just one break in the middle, and I have to say I have really started to like it. Rowing works a lot more muscles and muscle groups than other machines; when you finish a vigorous rowing workout you can feel it from your shoulders to your toes. With each passing day I feel more flexible and stronger, and I am losing weight. It is getting very easy to see how this machine can really deliver the fitness and weight loss results that I seek.The only real criticism I have of the WaterRower is the computer readout gadget. It isn't backlit, and it doesn't have color. It provides the basic information -- strokes per minute, heart rate ($100 extra for that option, ugh), time, distance, and 500 meter pace, the latter being the data point that rowers care most about -- but lacks the kinds of motivational tools, cool graphics, or competitive games that my wife and I are accustomed to seeing on exercise equipment. Supposedly there are third-party apps that you can use with a laptop to make things more interesting, such as rowing against a pace boat, or down scenic rivers and so forth, but NONE of them, as of this date, are for sale and operational. It looks to me like a small third-party market started to take off for WaterRower ten years ago and then kind of folded. The only app I could find which is working just provides basic performance info (pace, time, etc) on a computer or TV screen. Yawn. All that said, I knew when I bought it that the computer aspect is seriously lacking. WaterRower's top competitor, Concept2, has dramatically better computer functionality, apps, Internet community, and all that stuff. We thought about all that when making the purchase, but my wife and I decided that the relative quiet and pleasant, motivating water-swoosh sound was the core of what we wanted, and that we could live without an advanced tech side. Do take note that if you want the heart rate monitor -- and if you are out of shape, older or overweight, this is barely an option; you MUST have one -- it is a $100 added option. So add $100 to your cost projection for this machine.I would sum up the upsides of the WaterRower like this:- Genuinely attractive unit which fits perfectly in a well-furnished, upscale house. It does not turn a room of your house into an ""exercise room"".- As quiet an aerobic machine as anything we've ever used, with an incredibly pleasant swooshy water sound while you're rowing. Honestly the best-sounding piece of exercise equipment I've ever used- Comfortable seat on a supportive dual-rail system- Well-made machine which I think will last many years; the quality is apparent throughout- Well thought-out design enables you to stand it up flush against a wall in less than a minute, to get it out of the way- Compared to other rowing machines, it seems to have a smoother, more linear motion, which may be unrealistic in terms of actually rowing a boat but makes for a much better aerobic workout- Phenomenal workout - this is true of any rower, but it's still worth saying. This thing is a calorie destroyer. A month of rowing has made me much more fit, both cardio wise and in terms of muscle strengthening.- Not a bad price. It's less than half the cost of a good elliptical or treadmill. People complain about the price on the discussion forums, but in truth a k is not a lot of money for a high quality exercise machine. A WaterRower is not competing with some $399 piece of crap from Target. It's competing with $2,500 ellipticals.Overall, I have to say this was an outstanding purchase, and has my wife and me truly motivated to exercise in a way we weren't feeling in the last few years with other machines. I highly recommend checking one of these out if you're looking at rowing machines. This and the Concept2 are recognized by most people on most rowing forums as the two top-of-the-line offerings. The Concept2 wins big on computer readout and functionality, is incredibly well-made and durable, and is kind of the standard choice among serious athletes, Olympian types, commercial gyms, etc. However, it is noisy and has a huge footprint and makes whatever room it's in into the ""gym room"". The WaterRower has a subpar computer, and isn't as popular with serious hard-core athletes, but is probably just as reliable and durable. It has a huge advantage in terms of being quiet, aesthetically pleasing and non-gym-y, and ... well, you just have to hear the water swoosh to understand how pleasant and relaxing it is to row to that sound.PS We thought about spending the extra $500 to get the walnut, but decided to go with the ash and save some money. The ash is very attractive looking. There's really no reason to upgrade the wood from there, unless you've got money to burn and nothing better to do with it. I have also seen a walnut one and it's very nice looking, but just didn't seem $500 better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZXH1F545UBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A6QIMS#wasThisHelpful","R1XZXH1F545UBI","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite an interesting hot sauce. I'm a huge fan of Blair's hot sauces, of which there are many types - at least a dozen. They are rank-ordered by Blairs in terms of heat level and this is the 2nd mildest sauce in their lineup.The taste is great: a very strong Jalapeno taste with hints of garlic and some other spice(s). Unlike some (many?) hot sauces, which are all heat and little or no flavor, this one is all about the strong flavor. You can really, really taste those Jalapenos, and it goes fantastically well on things that benefit from an intense Jalapeno taste - eggs, chips, etc.  This sauce is *extremely* mild, and by mild, I mean it has almost no heat. It has turned out to be the perfect sauce to offer family and friends who don't like hot foods. The heat is so mild in this sauce that it's really more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. But that's OK - the flavor is superb; it stands on its own even without heat. It's just that if you want some heat, you'll have to add a real hot sauce to whatever food you're putting this on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149M2MGDR85IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DIWWE#wasThisHelpful","R149M2MGDR85IX","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great ""value"" mattress -- one of the best mattresses you can buy at this price point, which we are using for a guest room. But ... it is *very* firm. I've noticed that all of the cheaper memory foam mattresses have complaints about being too firm. It might be that a softer, plushier feel requires a more expensive production process for the memory foam. I'm not sure there is any mattress in this price range that'd be much softer. In our main bedroom we sleep on a latex mattress which is incomparably softer and more comfortable and plush than this one, but was $1,600 -- five times the cost. I think it's one of those ""you get what you pay for"" things. I'd say this mattress is a ""buy"" and maybe the best product available at its price, but if you're not into firm mattresses you may want to look around a bit first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NT6WRRSJ80ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0I8Q0E#wasThisHelpful","R3NT6WRRSJ80ON","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems kinda ridiculous to review an ice scoop, except ... this is a great ice scoop, worthy of a review!  It is plastic, not metal, so you can leave it in an ice bin/bucket in the freezer and not freeze your fingers when you pick it up. The scoop has been expertly designed to scoop just enough ice to fill a normal-sized soda glass to the top. It's tough and durable and ours has lasted a long time.

"I have been using the SterlingPro French coffee press for about a week, and I have to say I am really pleased with it. I've used it four times now.First things first: this press makes a *great* cup of coffee. The flavor is smooth and robust and could not be better. The operation of this (or any other coffee press) is pretty simple, albeit somewhat unfamiliar to most Americans (like me). You just add hot water to coffee grounds (use a ""course"" grind, not fine), and then press the grounds to the bottom, and voila! coffee. The coffee that comes out of a press is generally much better than that from a conventional coffee maker. It's stronger and more flavorful. The usual problem with coffee presses is that there's a lot of coffee grounds left in the coffee, which is irritating. However, the SterlingPro solves that problem, and I had practically no grounds whatsoever in my coffee in the four pots I made with it.The glass canister is removable from the base and can be put in a dishwasher, which is a big plus. Still, there's some hand-cleaning required of the other components, but that was no big deal.The pot and frame have an appealing upscale appearance, which looks great in my kitchen. I'm really pleased with the appearance of this unit.I think coffee presses haven't taken off here because there's a little extra work involved in them. However, they do make better coffee. Anyone interested in or willing to try a coffee press should find the SterlingPro a worthy addition to the kitchen. I have no problem giving this very nice piece of gear a 5 star review.Disclaimer: I received this for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1WVYA754UKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUHACEE#wasThisHelpful","R1X1WVYA754UKU","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this unit for about 3 weeks. I don't really see how you can get more bang for the buck than the LE650.The picture was good out of the box, and became ""great"" after a few hours of tweaking. My tweaks were pretty simple.  I turned down the red levels and color saturation (waaaaay too red and full of color out of the box for my taste); lowered the contrast a bit; increased the back lighting, etc. Go google ""LE650 picture settings"" and pick from among the five or six sites that offer comprehensive setting guidance. Any of them will do.The sound is, of course, mediocre, as one would expect. I got a Sony sound bar, which solved that problem. I think that in this day and age of inexpensive sound bars, TV companies are not even bothering anymore with the sound quality. Does anyone really buy a 60"" TV with the intent of listening to it through the TV's speakers? LOLI have had a few problems hooking up to wireless Internet, which I'm still working through (but with a Roku and a Chromecast, I'm not highly motivated to bother with the smart TV features, to be honest).With all those small annoyances, you might ask: why 5 stars? Well, futzing with the colors, getting a sound bar, and so on are minor things. The major thing with this set is that it brings 60 full inches of glorious HDTV into my living room for under a grand. And here's something else - no minor accomplishment, this:WITH THE LE650 YOU CAN COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY TURN OFF THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT.  100 % GONE, FOREVER.Try doing that with a Samsung. Any Samsung. You will fail, because it cannot be done on a Samsung. Or for that matter, virtually any other TV. But on this TV, the soap opera effect can be completely and totally and forever taken out of your life and destroyed. Please read the top-rated review for this TV here in this Amazon listing, for the adjustments to eliminate the soap opera effect.  It takes about 30 seconds and utterly works.  Some people don't mind the soap opera effect, many detest it. It is a bitter irony of our tech age that the newest technology in TV watching involves a completely unrealistic, irritating ""soap opera"" style of video display on the screen, which is much worse than watching a big fat tube TV from the 1980s. I would rather not watch TV at all than suffer through the soap opera effect. I bought this TV because I knew I could get rid of the hideous soap opera effect, and voila, I could.  For that, 5 solid stars.There are more expensive HDTVs that probably have a better picture, but unless you're comparing them side by side in a store, I really doubt most people could tell the difference. The picture on the LE650 is gigantic and amazing. For the pittance that this set costs relative to some others out there, it has to be highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C356L59DGC41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG5M93Y#wasThisHelpful","R3C356L59DGC41","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The flavor is excellent, probably in my Top 10 of hot sauces. Don't be fooled by the ""Death Sauce"" moniker. It's pretty mild. Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce ""medium hot"". True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. Overall , it's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly, unless you're seeking a truly hot hot sauce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LR316U6EVZQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DIWWD#wasThisHelpful","R3LR316U6EVZQJ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belizean Heat is probably the best-tasting hot sauce ever made. I've been eating, testing, and making my own hot sauces for many years, and trust me, there is NOTHING on the market that tastes as good as Belizean Heat. Unless of course you're not really into hot sauce and just want something mild and easy to put on nachos, burgers, etc., like Tabasco sauce. If you're into Habaneros and medium to high heat level hot sauces, there is simply nothing better on the market than Belizean Heat. Pepper enthusiasts know that Belize, for some reason, produces the best hot sauces in the world, and this one is the best that Belize has to offer.But ...Belizean Heat has 410 mg of salt per TEASPOON. That is basically 1/5 of the recommended salt intake for an entire day of food, for ONE TEASPOON of hot sauce. That is utterly ridiculous. By way of comparison, most other hot sauces are around 100 mg - still a lot of salt, but much more reasonable. Maybe if you're 20 and healthy you can afford to treat yourself to this fantastic sauce once in a while. For those over 30 or 35 it would really be irresponsible to consume more than the tiniest amounts of this sauce.So I am giving it 5 stars for being the best-tasting hot sauce ever, and 1 star for having over 4 times the salt of a normal hot sauce. Average = 3 stars.I was despondent when I learned about the salt content, because I used to go through a bottle of this stuff per week.Fortunately, all is not lost. I started trying every Belizean Habanero sauce I could get my hands on, to see if there was something else that could take its place. And guess what, there is. It's called Sontava, and it comes in X, XX, and XXX heat levels (the XXX has about the same heat level as Belizean Heat; the other two are much milder). Sontava has 95 % of the flavor and goodness of Belizean Heat with 100 mg per teaspoon of salt. Only the suicidal wouldn't find that a worthwhile tradeoff. So I recommend admiring Belizean Heat from afar and picking up a few bottles of Sontava. You won't be disappointed. While I like to have different sauces around, push comes to shove I could easily be happy with Sontava as my only hot sauce for all occasions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUPUG2C9LNFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HAL8UE#wasThisHelpful","R2JUPUG2C9LNFN","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This scale has attractive, contemporary styling which will fit in almost any kitchen environment. The digital readout is large and clear. I tested it to about 10 pounds (the highest weight I'd normally be measuring in a kitchen, i.e. a big pot of soup) and it was completely accurate from 5 grams to 10 lbs. All the usual functions are present - Tare, ounce/kg/lb/reset; it also has a timer. The best feature is probably that it has a hole in the middle (covered up in the marketing pic by the bowl of strawberries), making it easy to pick up and/or hang on a wall. The only downside is that the LED light goes out after a short period of about 10 seconds, forcing you to hit any of the front buttons to get it lit again (the #'s are impossible to read when the backlighting is turned off). Just about anything you'd be doing in a kitchen while preparing food takes more than 10 seconds, creating an annoying situation where you're hitting buttons again and again to keep the display readable. This should definitely be redesigned to provide 60 seconds before lights-out. However, aside from that, the scale seems to be very well designed, aesthetically and functionally.This is a good scale which in my mind is 4.5 stars - 5 stars for a well-designed, useful product, but docked a 1/2 star for the auto-turn-off of the light after 10 seconds. They should really change that. Regardless, still a very good kitchen scale.Disclaimer: I was sent one of these for an unbiased evaluation/review, at no cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPV7SSMUJKS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEOV4WW#wasThisHelpful","R2HPV7SSMUJKS2","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gun laser practice tool for target shooting practice, not just defensive shooting practice. In other words, you can use it to hone your precision aiming and marksmanship skills, not just the less precise draw-and-fire self defense drills which most products of this type are aimed at. The target overlays let you take the laser reception area down to a precise 1/2 inch, which is the correct scale for simulating 50 foot slow fire target shooting within the confines of a house, where your range might be 25-ish feet. Other overlays let you make the reception area an inch, or into an IDPA target shape, or you can just skip the overlays and get about a 1.5"" square to work with. It offers you a few different operating modes - counting your hits, or timed response where it beeps and counts 1/100ths of a second until you score a hit, and there's some third mode I haven't tried yet. It comes on a stand or mounts on a wall, is compact, light, and well made.It would be nice if the laser reception area was backlit. In lower or moderate indoor room lighting, the target area does not look a lot different than the overlays. Out past 20 feet or so, you can't really tell the two apart. The promo picture of the unit in this Amazon listing shows a bright red reception area, but in fact it's black and kinda hard to see. Nevertheless, the unit is great, best product in its category, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8MPFLX2RD0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXODP4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3T8MPFLX2RD0M","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Interesting video, and certain to inform and entertain those seeking some background knowledge on 1066. Pretty well done, too, in terms of the acting and scenery. That said, it's filled with historical inaccuracies and inattention to detail. Another reviewer commented on how weapons are left on the battlefield after the fight, and that is a good observation, because a good weapon was worth years of earnings and these were typically scooped up by the victors and scavengers before the dead bodies were cold. There are plenty of examples of similar oversight by the writers, throughout the video. There is also some general silliness in the writing. For instance, some Viking dude gives a pre-batte prep talk to his men, along the lines of: cattle die, kinsmen die, but the great deed lives on forever. That poetic phrase is from the Havamal, supposedly the words of the pagan god Odin. Good to see the writers studying the sources and documents, but it'd be a bit like a modern military commander reading a passage from Genesis to his troops to get them pumped for battle - it just doesn't fit the situation.

"These are great!  And fun. And durable! We have three cats and they LOVE sitting on our three perches (two of them are combined into a long perch for two cats on one big window sill). These can convert any window ledge (even a 3-4"" wide windowsill) into a hangout pad for up to two cats. And let me say this, it is really, really cute to find two cats chillaxin' together on these window perches. We've had our perches for about a year, and they are functioning perfectly. We might add a fourth, simply because they can turn almost any window into a cat lounge area, and the cats just love that.

"This is a very good toaster. It looks good and is quite stylish on a counter top. Toasting is EXTREMELY fast - considerably faster than any other toaster I've had, which is a plus in the morning. The bagel function is great on this model, giving you a nicely browned bagel, wicked-fast. The only drawback is that it toasts somewhat unevenly, meaning that a piece of toast (or bagel) won't be browned/cooked exactly the same on all sides, so it can require a bit of mid-toasting rotation to get an evenly toasted piece of bread. I notice that some reviewers really slam this unit due to the uneven toasting. I don't think it's that big a deal, personally, but it can't really be a 5-star toaster with uneven cooking.

"A good product, though not perfect. On the upside, it achieves about 80 % of what an old-school smelly, toxic solvent can achieve when cleaning a gun, without any odor or mess and without feeling like you just took a year or two off your life span by inhaling it. On the downside, 80 % is not 100 %. This product does not clean a bore as well as a traditional solvent. Something was given up in the formula in order to get rid of the toxic smell, and whatever it was, it is needed to get a bore totally clean.

"I already had their version of this holster for the G17, and recently added this one for my G19. I love the design. Anyone who's into Glocks knows that, due to the lack of an external safety, it is IMPERATIVE that the holster securely hold the gun in place and completely cover the trigger. This holster does that extremely well, with tough, thick kydex that absolutely will not allow for an accidental discharge. The release mechanism is superb and will prevent anyone from grabbing the gun out of your holster, while being easy to operate for a quick draw. The paddle is probably the best one on the market, securing very well to a belt or even just the top of jeans -- it is nearly impossible to pull the holster out while drawing the gun. Whether it's a ""conceal"" holster is in the eyes of the beholder; I would argue that it is not, unless you're wearing a long, loose sweater or a coat. I like everything about this holster, including the price, and recommend it without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2440V4SCCORGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BNI6DE#wasThisHelpful","R2440V4SCCORGQ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, simply put, is one of the most important resources ever put together for the study of 1066, Hastings and the Norman conquest. It is the resource that no one attempting to study that period can afford to be without. It provides every word written about the conflict in the original contemporary and near-contemporary sources, translated into modern English, of course. Most of the documents it includes are available out there in one form or another, but are prohibitively expensive to acquire one at a time, and require a lot of work to find. This book was, and remains, an incredible and unique resource to the 1066 enthusiast, and is a ""Must Buy"".There are so many fascinating things to learn from this book that it'd take way, way more than an Amazon review to describe it all. At the highest level, I could summarize what I got out of it thusly:  there really was very little written and documented at the time about 1066 (or at least, that made it down to our time). Couple of sentences here, a few pages there. Most of it was written well after Hastings, and by people who weren't eye-witnesses to it. Almost all of the books, movies, and academic analysis done in the following thousand years is based on these sources, and there's just not a lot of source material. Much of it is contradictory, obviously very subjective, and just ... sparse. It makes you realize that we know very, very little about 1066 and have been making gigantic assumptions and guesses about it ever since.Again: this book is an incredible resource, and should be the first thing that anyone interested in getting beyond pop-history and into serious learning about 1066 should purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32M4H68IQWPVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0851156193#wasThisHelpful","R32M4H68IQWPVJ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two of these. One works perfectly, but the other is defective and I've sent it back. I would've given the product four stars if not for the defective one, but I do get a feeling that these have an inconsistent build quality, and three stars is the max for that kind of situation.It's a good and useful lock-box. It's large enough to hold a compact or subcompact handgun (for instance, a Glock 26 or 19, but not a 17), plus a spare clip. It could also be used to store some cash, a passport, etc. Yet it is compact enough to toss in a small drawer or store under a car seat. In addition, it comes with a cable to secure it to anything you can wrap a cable around, such as a car seat mechanism. It is not a ""high security"" safe; honestly, anyone with a screwdriver or a hammer could probably get inside this thing in a couple of minutes. But it will generally keep out prying eyes, and would be enough of a pain in the ass to open such that some punk stealing loose change and CDs out of cars at a mall probably wouldn't bother with it. Understand, though, that any determined thief would be able to make short shrift of it.The combination lock is not the easiest thing to use, which makes it useless as a quick-access gun safe. If you think you might need immediate access to a firearm, this is not the safe for you. This one is more about very basic security of a weapon for transport purposes, or perhaps for short-term bedroom storage. In the home, it absolutely does not replace a real gun safe. If it sounds like I'm being negative about the safe, actually, I'm not. It just depends on what the application is. For temporary securing of a firearm in the car when going into a location where concealed carry is not permitted: great. For keeping a gun secured from curious kids: dangerous, and there are better options. So it all depends. It certainly seems like a lot of product for the extremely low cost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDPOEAFC82VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003841ZBS#wasThisHelpful","R1JDPOEAFC82VV","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, I've been encountering academic gibberish-speak and wondering what the hell it meant.  You know, the whole ""heteronormative society's hegemonic structures establish a paradigm of rationalistic male imperialistic spheres of racist Othering that transformates the cognitive self as selfness into a  ... blah blah blah""  Well, it turns out that it doesn't mean anything; it is, in fact, gibberish.In this informative, entertaining, and eye-opening book, Bawer describes what has happened in universities' Humanities departments, and particularly English Lit. It turns out our kids are not studying quite what we thought they were studying. Apparently, Shakespeare (which some English Lit departments don't teach at all, now) has been replaced by Womens Studies, Black Studies, Chicano Studies, and a slew of other ""Studies"". When identity politics came to the universities in the 1960s and 1970s, it resulted in new courses and new departments for aggrieved individuals and groups to have organized whine-athons focused on their own victimhood. These courses and departments have attracted a slew of mediocre talent as well as outright frauds, who've strained to achieve academic respectability. To do so, they've developed a pseudo-scientific lingo and body of ""theory"", which they call critical theory, from whence comes all the vaguely-subversive but basically meaningless gibberish about heternormative hegemonistic imperialism and so forth. Much, if not all, of the so-called ""theory"" boils down to ""We deserve more power and resources and money; give them to us."" It's just that such a simple formulation would neither win the argument nor give them the veneer of academic respectability they crave, so an entirely new psuedo-language of post-modernism has been invented. This is not a development to take too lightly, because at hundreds of universities degrees as high as Ph.D.'s are offered in these faux disciplines, sending kids with absolutely no skills, education, or ability to think out into the harsh world of employment and competition.Descriptions of academic conferences that Bower attended while researching this book are hilarious, and must be read and savored. I gave the book to my wife and we were  literally laughing out loud at the pretentious clown-shows going on all over the country, where black lesbian women outrank white lesbian women and both rank under black lesbian Chicano women, who rank less still than a lesbian Chicano handicapped trans-woman. The politically-correct, Marxist-leaning postmodern ""theory"" movement has driven itself into ideological chaos and mayhem, with a strict pecking order of victimness that ironically contradicts its now-quaint and quite obsolete egalitarian goals, and you will enjoy every page of it. At the same time, the humor is balanced by knowing that this is really happening. Thousands and thousands of students -- young people, who don't know any better -- are being exposed to this nonsense in insular classes and conferences walled off from the real world, creating yet another generation of Marxist parrots who will, like their parents and grandparents, need to learn how to think for themselves. The postmodern theory movement, in which students engage in group therapy sessions and compete to see who is more of a victim for their parents' $50,000 tuition payment per year, is so entrenched in American universities at this point that it will take many, many years to uproot it and replace it with actual educational content. And that is sad. But it's still funny.I highly recommend this book.

"My favorite target for target shooting in the 25 to 75 ft. range. They are just a god-send for the 40+ year old eyeball. At distances greater than, say, 40 feet, it's really difficult to monitor accuracy and progress using a traditional paper target, especially with a smaller caliber weapon such as a .22. The colorful splatter when a round hits this target is very easy to see at 50 feet and still possible to make out at 75. I use tons of these and only wish they came in a discounted mega-pack for those of us who blow through a pack or more per month. The 8"" width is not really necessary for an experienced shooter at 50-ish feet, and 6"" would probably suffice. But it is a good size target for newbies or those trying to extend their range, e.g. from 50 to 75 feet. What you lose in precise measurement for scoring (due to the imprecise splatter at the hole) you make up for in immediate, visible feedback after every shot. Personally, I am happy to give up a small amount of precise scoring in return for the ongoing visible feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5VE22DCJ6CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001EJEKM#wasThisHelpful","R1S5VE22DCJ6CJ","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blood of Ironside is the third book in the series ""The Lost King"" by Martin Lake. I enjoyed the first two books, which told a fictionalized account of the historical figure Edgar the Aetheling.This book, I loved.All three books in the series have Mr Lake's knack for rich characterization and good storytelling. I think if someone put an apple on a table and said to him, ""tell me a story about this apple,"" he could fill a chapter or maybe a whole novel with an imaginative, gripping scenario, filled with colorful characters, that leads, in the end, in a clever way, to the lone apple sitting in front of him. That kind of talent you either have or you don't. Nevertheless, the first two books were loosely-written, without decisive chapter-ending hooks and other traditional devices that propel the reader from page to page. In this book, Mr Lake demonstrates more command and ease with fiction-writing. This book has all of the same elements that make the other books good - richly developed characters and vividly told stories - while bringing a much more polished narrative flow. I simply could not put it down. It is a great yarn.What makes the historical Edgar Aetheling interesting was the momentous, history-changing times in which he lived, and the larger-than-life people he intersected with -- in particular William the Conqueror. Mr Lake's challenge, as I see it, was two-fold: to make Edgar and his band of kin and supporters, of which relatively little is known, into fully developed, compelling characters, but also to bring the huge historical currents alive in a visceral, realistic way for the reader. On both counts, this book is a success. Edgar and his band of merry, grouchy, troubled, desperate, hopeful, despairing men and women are truly good characters, fun to read about, and engaging enough to enjoy quite apart from the larger historical themes. And the book does an exceptional job of bringing you into the times, to see, hear, smell and feel what it was all about, from the very personal level to the geo-strategic and military level. I am already pretty familiar with the times and people with which this book is concerned, and yet feel that I learned quite a bit.Here's one thing I thought was fascinating about the book. William the Conqueror was (obviously) a major historical figure and an interesting, scary person. But I've always thought that the really interesting thing about William was the impact he had on the world and people around him. In one battle, he brought a decisive end to a six-hundred-year old culture and changed the history of Europe. In so doing, he radically impacted whole generations of people, from the lords to the peasants. His reach into the lives of others was massive. Lake does an exceptional job of articulating how this reach played itself out in so many ways, forcing difficult moral choices on people and forcing them to choose loyalties, pick sides, and even fight against each other. A battle scene toward the end of the book, where Edgar realizes he must fight and kill his own Englishmen, brilliantly brings forth the kind of conflicted, tortured-soul conflict that a game-changing person like William forces onto others. That, I believe, is the true accomplishment of this book.It's a very fun, well-written book and totally worth buying and reading. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9D95FQ7L1NCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EN35XIO#wasThisHelpful","R9D95FQ7L1NCH","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The writer provided me with a copy of this work for review, and I was pleased to read it. It provides a concise overview of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. It's quite short and therefore is not going to go into the kind of detail some might like. However, taken on its own merits, it was interesting and informative. I give credit to the writer for bringing a visceral, ground-level view of the battle alive for the reader in an unusually small number of pages. Actually, I can't think of a better way to get up to speed on a complex event like Agincourt in 15 or 20 minutes. Kudos to the author for having kind of an interesting idea about a new way to present information. It could've used a few more numbers to round out the visceral battle narrative, though. What'd be really interesting would be a collection of about thirty of these short one-day-in-history narratives, pulled together into a big, thick book on the seminal days of history. I think he'd have a real winner there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1RR0GROJY4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNIJPE0#wasThisHelpful","R1F1RR0GROJY4K","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot of hype surrounding this relatively new-to-market cleaning product, which happens to cost four times as much as some perfectly acceptable alternatives, but I can report that the hype is legit. I did the same test some others have done: I took a Glock 19 apart, and cleaned it thoroughly with my other cleaning products: Break Free CLP, Slip, Hoppes 9, etc. When it appeared there was no further carbon remaining on the pieces, I then cleaned the gun again with FireClean.  That resulted in a filthy towel full of carbon, meaning that FireClean had scrubbed crap off the gun that nothing else could reach. This test confirmed to me that Fireclean does what the hype claims. I think it is one of the best cleaning products on the market, and maybe the best.It leaves a nice smooth sheen on surfaces after you've applied it. My local gun smith says he applies CLP *after* FireClean, for another layer of lube and protection, but to my eyes FireClean seems to provide the appropriate amount of lubrication on its own, and the company's directions say not to use other products with it.I believe two products are still needed when using FireClean: a copper solvent, and perhaps a strong bore cleaner like Hoppes 9, for the barrel. For everything else, I think FireClean can get the job done on its own. I still have an open question about whether FireClean provides enough lubrication for a bolt carrier group. It doesn't give you that ""wet"" look that some folks are used to giving their bolts, but it does give all the parts a clean, smooth, slippery surface, which might actually be better. Time will tell. For a long time I have simply put all the parts of a bolt carrier group into a bowl, soaked them in strong solvent, then soaked them in Remington gun oil. I am not sure I'm going to change that formula, despite Fireclean probably being sufficient. Bolts are not really the place for experimentation.A really nice feature of FireClean is that it has no smell and is non-toxic. I cleaned the G19 at my kitchen table with the windows closed. My wife didn't complain. It's great to clean a gun without those toxic smells and that nagging question in the back of your mind of whether you've just knocked a few months off your life span. Even if FireClean were mediocre at cleaning, the lack of toxicity and odor would still be a strong argument for its use. But it is far from a mediocre product.Even at its absurdly high price, this product is worth it, but I do hope that after the inventors have made enough coin to be satisfied, they will bring the cost down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZ1AO7GSXA68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084J3CX6#wasThisHelpful","R1WZ1AO7GSXA68","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent one of these for review, and I have to say, it's a pretty impressive little tool. I tested it on a variety of offending small and medium branches in my garden, and it made short work of them. Just hold the handles and pull back and forth, and voila!, branches gone. I was surprised at how thick a branch this thing could work its way through. Of course, it cannot compete with a real chainsaw, but that isn't its purpose.

"This is a pretty nice range bag, although I wouldn't call it ""deluxe"". It's actually fairly small, relative to most range bags. It can fit 2 guns, a few boxes of ammo, ear and eye protection, and some small (8 or 10 "") targets; that's about it. Aside from its diminutive dimensions, the only thing I don't like about it is that the side pockets (there are four total) don't have much in the way of interior pockets or straps; there is a net inside one of them, which will hold a few magazines, but other than that, they're just empty pockets. Those critiques aside, I have several range bags and this tends to be one I use frequently when I'm just hitting the range for an hour with a gun or two for practice.

"This book and two-CD set is probably the best thing out there for self-taught people to pick up enough Old English to muddle through that ancient language.I decided to try to learn Old English on my own, with no classes, and no previous coursework. I ended up buying about ten different books. Honestly, I found most of them really terrible -- pedantic, too difficult, overwhelming, and demoralizing. In some cases I had no idea why the person even bothered putting together the book, other than to have a book to sell, since it was plainly obvious that no one could accomplish the objective of learning Old English from it.But this one is different. It takes an organic, versus grammatical approach, which -- your mileage may vary -- I just find a lot better suited to the independent adult learner. I did one chapter a day for a while. None of them were overwhelming, and I gradually got a sense of what the language was about. Lots of cultural and historical stuff is included in the chapters to keep it interesting, which is a big, big, big deal for language study: it gets very tiring, very fast, to memorize verb tables and so forth, no matter how motivated you are. This book seemed to be going at the pace I could deal with: fast enough to learn stuff, without making me put it down to clear my head. I learned a lot about Anglo Saxon culture, in addition to the language.I sadly am dinging it a star for the rather bizarre audio recordings.  There are two speakers, female and male.  The female's voice is crystal clear, loud, and very easy to understand.  The male's voice, though, is muffled, lower in volume, and extremely hard to hear and understand. He's a mumbler, and even his words in modern English are barely comprehensible - sometimes they cannot be heard or understood at all. It seems to me that if the whole purpose of a disk is for people to hear words distinctly, then someone should've listened in the product development phase and said, ""Speak up!."" I am only dinging one star, because the audio recordings are not essential to the package, and you can get a flavor of the language from the woman's voice parts. If the audio was much more essential to the total learning experience of this package, I'd have dinged it a lot more than one star.That one complaint aside, I do think this is by far the easiest and most accessible thing out there for learning some Old English independently. And it does give you a jump-start if you then want to tackle some of the more complex books and learning tools out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Q5UFURX3VKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071747737#wasThisHelpful","R9Q5UFURX3VKT","A3U4FCEAT75XLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U4FCEAT75XLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased as a replacement for an Exerpeutic recumbent bike, which I had a terrible ""in-warranty"" experience with (in-warranty in theory perhaps, but requiring me to send the entire bike back at my expense without even offering to troubleshoot or fix locally was a non-starter). Ironically I kept the Exerpeutic - the seat half, anyway - and parked the MagneTrainer in front of it.I had previously purchased the MagneTrainer's little sister, the much smaller DeskCycle, and this is mostly the source of my one star off. That's because the manufacturer makes great play out of how the two units use the same mechanism. Except, that's not entirely true: while the basic magnetic resistance machinery may indeed be identical (I haven't disassembled them to find out), in practice the DeskCycle functions differently - and better. On the DeskCycle, the resistance adjustment knob cycles through a series of positive detents, with a readout (under a clear panel on the top of the unit) showing you exactly what level you are on. With the MagneTrainer, there's just a spinning knob with no indication of where it is set to. This makes it rather frustrating to try to repeat an exercise cycle or to cool down consistently (the latter exacerbated by the knob being too low to easily reach and change ""on the fly,"" a problem shared with the DeskCycle). It just spins.And spins, and spins. Because while on the DeskCycle the entire workout range is within eight clicks and one revolution of the resistance adjustment knob, it takes nearly five full rotations of the knob on the MagneTrainer to go from minimum to maximum resistance. I suspect this is the root cause of some of the one- and two-star reviews of customers claiming they don't see any change in resistance; it is not at all obvious that the user is expected to keep spinning the knob round and round to change resistance.The pedals are awfully small, but they double as hand cranks so I won't hold that against them. It accepts standard 9/16"" pedals so you can always put a regular bike pedal on them. By the way, after a few workouts my left pedal started to clunk every time it passed the 5 o'clock position. An email to the manufacturer returned an almost immediate reply with a suggestion and an offer to have a local shop fix it for free if need be. The suggestion worked - skip the cheap wrench included with the MagneTrainer and put a big regular crescent wrench on the pedal and really crank it down = now totally silent - but the offer to have somebody local fix it WITHOUT ME EVEN ASKING (what a concept!) was a major confidence booster after my prior bad experience with their competitor.The other problem is the slipping around on the floor issue that every reviewer complains about...but I found a 100% fix. Nearly all of my rooms, including my gym, have carpets and none of them are shag; my upstairs are flat carpet tiles and the gym has industrial outdoor-type mats. On a hunch, I verified that the ""hook"" side of a piece of Velcro sticks quite nicely to the carpet. I bought a two-pack of 1""x 2"" Velcro (available on Amazon but cheaper at Home Depot), cut the two pieces in half, and stuck just the four hook sides to the bottom of the MagneTrainer feet. Perfect fit and the unit now does not budge a millimeter under the highest resistance, even without being careful to ""pedal downwards"" as they recommend in the instructions.EDIT: the glue on the Velcro gave way, but I had a fix for that too: a staple at the front and rear edges, going into the rubber pad.As for the rest...one slightly disconcerting thing is that when pedaling at high resistance I can see the resistance adjustment knob drifting from left to right to left as I pedal, but I have not noticed anything bad as a result and at least at first glance, the entire unit seems extremely solid (a property shared with the DeskCycle) compared to other mini exercise bikes. The unit has outstanding resistance and is virtually silent (its plastic body creaked a bit when I finished re-installing the left pedal, but that was because I had shoved it to one side by pushing against it while tightening down the pedal; once I straightened it back out, no further noise). EDIT: the ""creak"" keeps coming back, so I removed the body. That was a pain, so down another half a star. Now that the body is off, I see why the knob drifts left and right: the pedals and pulleys are located between two vertical pieces of sheet metal and they flex a bit as the pedals rotate.It has almost, but not quite, as wide a traveling diameter as the Exerpeutic (i.e. as a regular road bicycle) and provides very good range of motion, much more than the DeskCycle.  Be aware that the readout is useless for accurate calorie count (it does not account for resistance level, which while theoretically possible for the DeskCycle is obviously impossible for the MagneTrainer for the reasons described above). I confirmed this by pedaling one mile at both the minimum and maximum (whoof!) resistances and both read 25 calories. Distance and/or time are what you'll be using in practice. At least with the DeskCycle you'd be able to guesstimate but with no indication of the resistance on the MagneTrainer you can forget calculating calories.So a very well made unit and a responsive company. What's not to like? Oh right, the lack of discrete resistance levels, the resistance knob not being mounted high so you can reach it without stopping, and inability to count calories. Well, there's always the hope of a version 2. Meanwhile, the MagneTrainer is a great bike and a great bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KADH56QZWDT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V53KD8#wasThisHelpful","R3KADH56QZWDT9","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This one does recharge but the spring on the side is far too weak and unless for some reason you have a jack that is angled upwards (against gravity) the flashlight works itself loose over every little bump and stops charging. I have to constantly keep pushing it back into the socket. So three stars for a nice light that is difficult to recharge = annoying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REIN3Y0PA9BAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125QQRC6#wasThisHelpful","REIN3Y0PA9BAM","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does not work with the lighter outlet in any of several Fords, and I'm just about willing to bet any other U.S.-manufactured automobile. Foreign cars? Don't know but would not recommend taking the chance. Every lighter jack I've examined has the positive contact recessed inside a well, probably to keep children from jamming their fingers and other things into it, and this flashlight lacks the tip (that's present on EVERY SINGLE lighter plug) to fit into it. Since the big disc on the end of this will only work with some (non-recessed) jacks and a plug with a tip will work with 100% of all jacks, it does make one wonder what they were thinking when they designed this.By they way I wound up buying the Nebo that DOES have the tip (also on Amazon) and not too thrilled with it either - nice (albeit non-adjustable) light but constantly creeps out of the jack and disconnects so it stops charging.

"Fairly simple setup, and works. Situation: recently ""cut the cord"" by canceling Cablevision and turning in the CableCard to my Ceton 4-tuner USB box. The thing is, I discovered entirely by accident that even though I no longer paid for cable TV, I actually still received the local channels - they must be included with the internet service, but Cablevision doesn't exactly go out of their way to advertise that (they would have gladly had me pay $12.95 a month for channels I already get). But even though technically I could get them, the Ceton was just terrible at receiving them; it would get confused (especially when trying to record two things at once) and required a laborious reset and rescan process. Don't get me wrong, the Ceton is a fabulous five-star device when running off CableCard, I suspect they never thought anybody would ever use it for ClearQAM cable signals and so while it technically lists QAM as one of its capabilities, it doesn't look like they put much effort into it (and yes I have all the latest drivers and firmware). I found a Microsoft Windows 7 patch whose description indicated it was what I needed, but I kept getting the helpful message ""This update is not applicable.""So I replaced it with the HDHomeRun, but not without some trepidation: according to the product description, I had no reason to think it would work at all! For starters, according to the product comparison table it is SD not HD: yes, but only when you are using it wirelessly; a PC or laptop that is hardwired to the network receives glorious HD just fine. And more importantly, according to the Amazon product description it MUST be connected to an antenna. It's even repeated right on the box: Antenna >required<. Except that it's not: ""antenna or television cable carrying QAM signal required"" would be more accurate.The instructions tell you to log onto SiliconDust's web site to download the drivers and set things up, so hopefully they will stay in business (I filed away the driver for a rainy day). And getting ClearQAM to work was a bit of an [undocumented] hassle: first set up the channels ON THE WEB SITE (EDIT: or, as I accidentally discovered, the Home Run program that the setup will install on your desktop), and then and only then go into Media Center and run TV signal setup, otherwise you get a Tuner Not Found error. All in all it took about an hour to set up, although most of that time consisted of the Web Site and then Media Center scanning for channels and I didn't have to be in front of the PC during that time. And worth the effort: unlike the Ceton, the HomeRun instantly switches from channel to channel and it has thus far faithfully recorded my local shows. (EDIT: once in a great while it pops up a ""cannot record"" or ""tuner busy"" message even though only one other thing was being recorded or watched. I have Media Center set to start recording several minutes in advance and while the message is a bit disconcerting, so far I don't think it has actually failed to record a show, I think it just keeps trying until whatever the error is clears itself.) And unlike the Ceton, it's on my home network so it can be used by any of my computers.Speaking of which, one of the selling points is that it will also transmit wirelessly to any device, including phones and tablets (SD only for this particular version, it appears they have another model that does wireless HD as well). I have not tried that, because not mentioned in the instructions or product description is that you must first download the SiliconDust app to your tablet - and it is >not< free!Five stars for functionality, a star off for being a bit confusing and misleading. If my main use was going to be to watch TV on my tablet I would have knocked another star off for price gouging: everything needed for the gizmo to do what it is advertised to do should be included in the price or at least make it absolutely clear up front that you are going to be required to spend more money to get the functionality they're advertising.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N4KS55939FZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY0UB54#wasThisHelpful","R2N4KS55939FZC","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dry, so that should be taken into account in recipes. I would not for example make tacos with it, but mixed in with a base that contains fat (say sour cream or butter), just fine. I use it to supplement the excellent Hormel refrigerated pork, which is delicious but whose drippings are overwhelming on their own. Fried tomatillos and onions in garlic and olive oil, tomatoes and black olives, a can white chili beans and a little can of chopped chilies, cumin, lots of oregano and cilantro, Hormel fresh pork and part of the drippings as the main meat (hint: pour the rest into the rice and you won't need to salt the rice), and a can of Keystone mushed up (you can do it by hand, no chopping necessary - that consistency might be a turnoff for some and makes it inappropriate for some recipes), as the base.Top with sour cream and serve on yellow rice.

"As noted by other, cheap construction but hey, sixty bucks. But also, mine was sloppily assembled - the three internal braces hold the motor so that the blades don't contact anything, and the motor was at an angle so ironically the blades whacked right into one of the very braces holding it. I realize that for $60 they're not going to do a ""burn in"" on each unit, but all it took was just to spin the blade with a finger and they'd have known it wasn't assembled correctly. Do what the assembler failed to do - SPIN THE FAN BY HAND before you install it! Loosened the three screws squeezing the motor, gave the blades the aforementioned spin, and tightened the screws back down with no additional drama.One odd thing is that it does not come with the little screw-on pass-through clamp that holds your feed wire securely in the hole entering the thermostat box, so if you are buying to replace an old unit make sure to confiscate that clamp assembly from your old fan first. Instead of building something fancy out of plywood, I bought a $5 18""x24"" sheet of corrugated plastic at Home Depot, used a carpet knife to cut a circle out of it, slide it over the housing, and once the fan brackets were screwed in I just used a staple gun to tack the edges of the plastic sheet against the attic frame. It was close to 100 degrees outside today and I would guess about 140 degrees in the peak of the attic where I was working, so I was eager to finish the installation as quickly as possible and very happy when I was able to energize the fan and get some air moving.Because the housing is way way cheaper than my old fan (which had an honest-to-goodness formed shroud. not just a piece of bent sheet metal), it easily comes ""out of round"" so before you put in that last bracket screw, give the fan a last spin by hand to make sure it still has clearance.Noisy, but honestly no more so than the one it replaced (um, I mean before its bearings gave out, of course - screeeetch!) which was a surprise because my old fan had ""real"" fan blades while this had, again, just pieces of sheet metal for blades. I bypassed the thermostat (the thermostat is not actually wired up out of the box) so cannot speak to its function, I'm fine with just the on/off switch in my bathroom.Not expecting it to last forever but if it lasts ten years I'll be both pleased and surprised. Looks like a good value for the money, just don't expect a Cadillac.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6VYQAS3E0B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LNII4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2P6VYQAS3E0B2","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Was extremely nervous about this for two reasons.1. Excessively, incredibly large number of pixels equals excessively, incredibly high likelihood of dead or stuck pixels. I hate 'em. It's...lessee...width times height...carry the one...just shy of FIVE MILLION pixels. Well, your mileage may vary, but mine had no pixel problems whatsoever. I have to stress that: not a single bad pixel out of five million. Wow.2. Excessively, incredibly large number of pixels equals excessively, incredibly high burden on graphics adapter. Now I will admit that I had not bought a computer in a long time but my brand-new Ultrabox (formerly known as Hush PC) is a completely silent model, meaning no fans; so while it is the ""newest generation"" it is also not running at nearly whatever speed the latest and greatest are capable of. Didn't matter; hooked up through DisplayPort and alongside (I realize how disgusting this must sound) a partner 1920x1080P touchscreen on HDMI (yes I really do use both, more on that in a moment), I'm still able to pump full out 3440x1440x60Hz and play full-screen 1080 videos without a hitch.Having said that, there are some issues. The first is with the DisplayPort itself: I have sound piped through the Envy by default, but about one out of six times the sound instead directs through the sister monitor. Control Panel insists that the Envy is disconnected. Not disabled; disconnected. Unplugging the DisplayPort cable and plugging back in instantly solves the problem. I don't think there is going to be a retroactive fix for that, hopefully they will at least find and fix the bug causing this going forward. By the way, you could simply use HDMI but at this resolution and this version of HDMI (1.2 I believe) it will only manage 30Hz at full resolution. For some that may be okay but kind of defeats the purpose of such a high resolution monitor. Before you ask, yes I tried running just the Envy by itself, but still about one in six times it had no audio connection. EDIT: I've now tried two different DisplayPort cables with the same issue, so it does look like this is a bug inside the Envy; it could be the video card or its drivers, but then that wouldn't explain why the sound then works on HDMI.My video adapter cannot put out 4K so I can't speak to how the Envy deals with such ultrahigh resolutions, but 3440x1440 is just a tad shy of 4K anyway.Color is generally excellent, but you get a LOT of light bleed along the bottom. Only noticeable when the entire screen is very dark. Oddly, I get a bad gamma problem when Windows is booting up (screen picture way too bright and way too little contrast) but a few seconds after displaying the desktop it fixes itself - usually. This is of course a Windows thing but it no doubt comes from Windows and the Envy handshaking and once in a great while it never does fix itself. Again, unplugging and re-plugging the DisplayPort cable does the trick.The curve is actually really good. I thought I wanted a seriously curved monitor to get a wraparound effect. I now realize that the monitor does not appear curved at all - it looks like it is perfectly flat and straight, which of course means the curve is doing exactly what it should.Sound is excellent, but the volume control is really annoying. It's a physical rotating wheel under the left bezel, and you have to turn it to raise the volume. And turn. And turn some more. It should be literally ten times more sensitive than it is. I just keep it cranked (no buzzing or hissing) and use Windows to control the volume.Okay, I know you're wondering why on Earth I need a second monitor with something as huge as the Envy, so I'll explain: I play Flight Simulator, turn virtual cockpit off, and drag the instrument panel over to the other monitor and resize it to fit. Now I have an completely uninterrupted (and HUGE) view of my surroundings in front of me, and my instrument panel is on the smaller monitor - which is a touchscreen, so I can actually click buttons and spin wheels with my fingers. I use Megascenary's photorealistic (actual photographs) scenery and get good refresh rates; I am told that if I was using the autogenerated scenery (the fake scenery that comes with Flight Simulator) then I would need a much more powerful computer with a screen as big as the Envy.Like pretty much every modern monitor, you can plug this into a USB port and use it as a USB hub/extender. But the extension USB ports are in a terrible location, about dead center of the back, requiring you to crawl around to get to them. Why not near or even along the side like other monitors?It can be set to kill the power if the screen goes blank, so you can use your power-off screensaver or a third-party program (I use the excellent little ""Wizmo"" and tie it to a hotkey) and the monitor will power itself off after a few seconds. You might think all monitors do this, but it's hit and miss with some brands so I thought I'd mention it.Running Windows 7 or 8 you can really take advantage of the ""drag windows to the side and watch Windows resize window to exactly fill half the screen"" feature. Looks great running two applications side-by-side and the Windows 7/8 snap-to-side feature makes it, well, a snap. One unusual use of this is if you have older programs that simply will not run in Win7 and have to run in the ""Virtual XP"" mode. You can drag your Windows XP Mode window over to the right side of the Envy and Windows will resize it to fill the right side of the screen - and because the Envy has so much real estate, it's like you have a complete Windows XP system sitting side-by-side with Windows 7.Finally, I get some horizontal tearing playing large or full-screen videos. I have not yet determined if that's the Envy or a video adapter or driver issue. It's not a showstopper in any event, only noticeable on occasion.At this price, unless you have an older computer coupled to an older graphics adapter, you really don't have an excuse not to buy one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZUM0UK3QZL4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC7ETO8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZUM0UK3QZL4W","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, make sure you shop around. I got mine from the website of that big chain that starts with W and ends in Mart, $100 less than the best price I could find on Amazon and free shipping to the store. Wow.1. Absolutely true that it is very quiet. The review that you have to be standing right next to it in order to hear it is, in my opinion, a bit of hyperbole, but subjectively about a third the noise created by my old Kenmore (Whirlpool in disguise).2. Also true that it does not completely dry dishes. Once the unit beeps (more on that in a moment) to tell you it's done, crack the door open so the steam can escape.3. And yes, it's true that it takes forever to complete a cycle. But here's the thing: it uses very little water (again, about a third as much as the Kenmore) and incidentally, about a third as much detergent; obviously, they have traded water volume for cycle time. Does it really matter that a dishwasher takes longer? I guess if you really needed a full-size dishwasher but couldn't make room for it so you need to turn around several cycles back-to-back in order to wash all of your dishes, that could be a consideration. But if all you really needed in the first place was an 18"", who cares if it takes two hours instead of one hour, especially if it is using less water, less detergent, and (according to the Energy Star rating) less electricity?4. Eight place settings? Of what, dollhouse dishes? Now that one *IS* hyperbole. The owner's manual shows a picture of the rack filled to the gills, plates and bowls facing down. Yes, it is possible to fill the rack from one side to the other with plates and bowls...and quite impossible to then slide the rack into the dishwasher and close the door. If you go by the owner's manual, then the tines by the left side of the rack are there only for show: you cannot actually put anything there or they will overhang the side of the rack. Oddly, one of the pictures in one of the several Amazon product pages for this unit shows the rack filled with bowls and plates facing UP, in which case you can in fact fill the rack...but that contradicts the owner's manual! (I tried washing dishes with the plates facing up and it does in fact work, so is the manual wrong?)The upshot is that this is a four-place setting washer and a bit tight even for that.  This unit is fine for two people washing dishes every several days, or a family of four washing daily, but that's it. They have compensated to some extent by very carefully engineering the small interior - the smallest interior of a standing dishwasher I have ever seen, probably to make room for the extra insulation that makes it so quiet and energy efficient - to maximize what you can get in, but the special bowl holders and flip-down mug rack aren't going to help when you have a giant salad bowl or anything else unusual in size to wash. The good news is that because the top rack has its own independent spray arm - a standard feature in 24"" washers but fairly uncommon in a compact portable (neither of my Kenmores had one) - you can get away with piling one or two large items on top of other dishes in the top rack; presuming they're flat enough to still slide the rack back in, they'll come out clean.Speaking of the owner's manual, it fails to provide some useful bits of information. I had the devil of a time trying to figure out how to wash wine glasses; I use the excellent Quirky Tethers (do a search) and was frustrated by the fact that the bottom rack has large areas with no supporting wire running underneath (so on one side of the tines a wine glass has something to sit on, but on the other side they'd just fall through). It turns out that there is a dedicated place for wine glasses: the left side of the top rack (the aforementioned mug rack) also doubles as a wine glass stem holder, with special inserts to fit the stems into, holding the glass at a downwards angle (doing so means you can't fit any mugs underneath, but you can put mugs on the right side of the top rack). You can fit four regular wine glasses or three jumbo Riedels. That's great, but there is zero mention of this in the owner's manual; I figured it out by accident while Googling ""dishwasher wine rack"" and saw a photo of this exact same solution...on the website of one of Danby's competitors!5. It does a GREAT job of washing dishes. I tried a ""regular"" wash cycle with maximum detergent (hint: don't fill the entire detergent dispenser, you fill either the left side for small loads or the right side for big loads, not both) and dishes and utensils with caked-on food and everything came out sparkling. I haven't tried non-soaked, baked-on food yet but there is a pots-n-pans cycle for that. The very long soak pre-wash may be to credit for this. I was highly skeptical of the unusual silverware basket, in which forks and spoons go in handle-down: with most of the water pressure wasted on the handle and the plastic holder itself, how can it do a good job of cleaning the business end of the silverware? But it does.Here's another helpful tip not covered in the manual: if silverware has to go in the special basket that holds each fork and spoon facing up, then where on Earth do you put utensils? In turns out that the special silverware basket is actually two trays side-by-side, the tops of which can be unclipped and removed to reveal a conventional dishwasher silverware basket underneath. I removed one top, put my utensils on that side, and continued to put ordinary silverware on the side with the special holder top. Big utensils like spatulas you'll have to lay down in the top rack, but that's true of all but the biggest of dishwashers anyway.6. I use my portables as a sort-of built-in: I slide it under a counter and hook it up to the hot water and drain under the sink. This is one big star off as I discovered to my horror that the water feed hose is connected directly to the solenoid valve at the bottom of the unit (held on by a oetiker clamp, non-removable). This is unlike any dishwasher I have ever seen and means that you cannot simply remove the portable hose and screw on a replacement or an extension (and the portable hose is short, about 1 meter). It also means that if that hose ever leaks, you're screwed. In exchanges with other posters here on Amazon it appears that earlier versions *DID* have a screw-off hose and that is a huge move down in flexibility and long-term reliability. How much does a washing machine hose fitting cost, wholesale? Fifty cents? Shame on you, Danby. Anyway, I sliced the permanently-attached hoses in half with a carpet knife (voiding the warranty, no doubt, while a screw-on hose would mean I could just put the old hose back on if needed) and, with great trepidation, connected it to the push-on compression line I had coming off my hot water line with an adapter and barb fitting from Home Depot, secured by a radiator hose clamp. Not a drop of leakage, which leads me to...7. ...Superior solenoid design. My old dishwasher, and its predecessor, and every washing machine I have ever owned, had plunger-type solenoid valves: one moment it's on, the next moment it's off. You know what I'm talking about: the dishwasher or washing machine makes a huge CLUNK sound as the water comes on or off. That creates a momentary spike in the pressure inside the hose and can cause anything short of a perfect seal to leak and eventually fail. The Danby valve opens and closes more slowly, preventing that sudden thump. Hence, no leaks at my jury-rigged hose connection.4. Eight place settings? Of what, dollhouse dishes? Now that one *IS* hyperbole. The owner's manual shows a picture of the rack filled to the gills, plates and bowls facing down. Yes it is possible to fill the rack from one side to the other with plates and bowls...and quite impossible to then slide the rack into the dishwasher and close the door.

It would not fit under the counter on its wheels. It is not obvious how to remove the wheels; what you do is push a large flat screwdriver in perpendicularly at the top and push off the slip rings that hold them in place. Removing the wheels creates a new problem: the Danby cannot sit on the floor without wheels, because it has an irregular bottom. But inboard of the wheels there is another set of holes, I'm guessing put there for the undercabinet version so both models can share the same chassis. It turns out that a set of flat office chair feet fit perfectly; I used these:  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CF06M1O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1>. They'll wobble a bit when the dishwasher is flipped over, but once you set the dishwasher down they're rock solid. They'll need a nudge to get them to go into the holes, one tap of a mallet or a hammer will do.9. Water is not heated during pre-rinse; but it is heated during main wash cycle. I verified this by running it off just cold water and checking the temperature at various points during the wash. The pre-rinse stayed ice cold but the wash water warmed up over time until it was steaming hot. Not hot right at the start so it does not pre-heat like some dishwashers, but with such long cycles that shouldn't make a difference.10. It beeps.

"First, make sure you shop around. I got mine from the website of that big chain that starts with W and ends in Mart, $100 less than the best price I could find on Amazon and free shipping to the store. Wow. EDIT: as of this moment I see prices for this on Amazon range from $550 (gulp!) to >>$85<< - but that $85 doesn't include the additional $350 shipping. And this item has several different listings on Amazon. So like I said: shop around!1. Absolutely true that it is very quiet. The review that you have to be standing right next to it in order to hear it is, in my opinion, a bit of hyperbole, but subjectively about a third the noise created by my old Kenmore (Whirlpool in disguise).2. Also true that it does not completely dry dishes. Once the unit beeps (more on that in a moment) to tell you it's done, crack the door open so the steam can escape.3. And yes, it's true that it takes forever to complete a cycle. But here's the thing: it uses very little water (again, about a third as much as the Kenmore) and incidentally, about a third as much detergent; obviously, they have traded water volume for cycle time. Does it really matter that a dishwasher takes longer? I guess if you really needed a full-size dishwasher but couldn't make room for it so you need to turn around several cycles back-to-back in order to wash all of your dishes, that could be a consideration. But if all you really needed in the first place was an 18"", who cares if it takes two hours instead of one hour, especially if it is using less water, less detergent, and (according to the Energy Star rating) less electricity?4. Eight place settings? Of what, dollhouse dishes? Now that one *IS* hyperbole. The owner's manual shows a picture of the rack filled to the gills, plates and bowls facing down. Yes, it is possible to fill the rack from one side to the other with plates and bowls...and quite impossible to then slide the rack into the dishwasher and close the door. If you go by the owner's manual, then the tines by the left side of the rack are there only for show: you cannot actually put anything there or they will overhang the side of the rack. Oddly, one of the pictures in one of the several Amazon product pages for this unit shows the rack filled with bowls and plates facing UP, in which case you can in fact fill the rack...but that contradicts the owner's manual! (I tried washing dishes with the plates facing up and it does in fact work, so is the manual wrong?)The upshot is that this is a four-place setting washer and a bit tight even for that.  This unit is fine for two people washing dishes every several days, or a family of four washing daily, but that's it. They have compensated to some extent by very carefully engineering the small interior - the smallest interior of a standing dishwasher I have ever seen, probably to make room for the extra insulation that makes it so quiet and energy efficient - to maximize what you can get in, but the special bowl holders and flip-down mug rack aren't going to help when you have a giant salad bowl or anything else unusual in size to wash. The good news is that because the top rack has its own independent spray arm - a standard feature in 24"" washers but fairly uncommon in a compact portable (neither of my Kenmores had one) - you can get away with piling one or two large items on top of other dishes in the top rack; presuming they're flat enough to still slide the rack back in, they'll come out clean.Speaking of the owner's manual, it fails to provide some useful bits of information. I had the devil of a time trying to figure out how to wash wine glasses; I use the excellent Quirky Tethers (do a search) and was frustrated by the fact that the bottom rack has large areas with no supporting wire running underneath (so on one side of the tines a wine glass has something to sit on, but on the other side they'd just fall through). It turns out that there is a dedicated place for wine glasses: the left side of the top rack (the aforementioned mug rack) also doubles as a wine glass stem holder, with special inserts to fit the stems into, holding the glass at a downwards angle (doing so means you can't fit any mugs underneath, but you can put mugs on the right side of the top rack). You can fit four regular wine glasses or three jumbo Riedels. That's great, but there is zero mention of this in the owner's manual; I figured it out by accident while Googling ""dishwasher wine rack"" and saw a photo of this exact same solution...on the website of one of Danby's competitors!5. It does a GREAT job of washing dishes. I tried a ""regular"" wash cycle with maximum detergent (hint: don't fill the entire detergent dispenser, you fill either the left side for small loads or the right side for big loads, not both) and dishes and utensils with caked-on food and everything came out sparkling. I haven't tried non-soaked, baked-on food yet but there is a pots-n-pans cycle for that. The very long soak pre-wash may be to credit for this. I was highly skeptical of the unusual silverware basket, in which forks and spoons go in handle-down: with most of the water pressure wasted on the handle and the plastic holder itself, how can it do a good job of cleaning the business end of the silverware? But it does.Here's another helpful tip not covered in the manual: if silverware has to go in the special basket that holds each fork and spoon facing up, then where on Earth do you put utensils? In turns out that the special silverware basket is actually two trays side-by-side, the tops of which can be unclipped and removed to reveal a conventional dishwasher silverware basket underneath. I removed one top, put my utensils on that side, and continued to put ordinary silverware on the side with the special holder top. Big utensils like spatulas you'll have to lay down in the top rack, but that's true of all but the biggest of dishwashers anyway.6. I use my portables as a sort-of built-in: I slide it under a counter and hook it up to the hot water and drain under the sink. This is one big star off as I discovered to my horror that the water feed hose is connected directly to the solenoid valve at the bottom of the unit (held on by a oetiker clamp, non-removable). This is unlike any dishwasher I have ever seen and means that you cannot simply remove the portable hose and screw on a replacement or an extension (and the portable hose is short, about 1 meter). It also means that if that hose ever leaks, you're screwed. In exchanges with other posters here on Amazon it appears that earlier versions *DID* have a screw-off hose and that is a huge move down in flexibility and long-term reliability. How much does a washing machine hose fitting cost, wholesale? Fifty cents? Shame on you, Danby. Anyway, I sliced the permanently-attached hoses in half with a carpet knife (voiding the warranty, no doubt, while a screw-on hose would mean I could just put the old hose back on if needed) and, with great trepidation, connected it to the push-on compression line I had coming off my hot water line with an adapter and barb fitting from Home Depot, secured by a radiator hose clamp. Not a drop of leakage, which leads me to...7. ...Superior solenoid design. My old dishwasher, and its predecessor, and every washing machine I have ever owned, had plunger-type solenoid valves: one moment it's on, the next moment it's off. You know what I'm talking about: the dishwasher or washing machine makes a huge CLUNK sound as the water comes on or off. That creates a momentary spike in the pressure inside the hose and can cause anything short of a perfect seal to leak and eventually fail. The Danby valve opens and closes more slowly, preventing that sudden thump. Hence, no leaks at my jury-rigged hose connection.8. It would not fit under the counter on its wheels. It is not obvious how to remove the wheels; what you do is push a large flat screwdriver in perpendicularly at the top and push off the slip rings that hold them in place. Removing the wheels creates a new problem: the Danby cannot sit on the floor without wheels, because it has an irregular bottom. But inboard of the wheels there is another set of holes, I'm guessing put there for the undercabinet version so both models can share the same chassis. It turns out that a set of flat office chair feet fit perfectly; I used these:  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CF06M1O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1>. They'll wobble a bit when the dishwasher is flipped over, but once you set the dishwasher down they're rock solid. They'll need a nudge to get them to go into the holes, one tap of a mallet or a hammer will do.9. Water is not heated during pre-rinse; but it is heated during main wash cycle. I verified this by running it off just cold water and checking the temperature at various points during the wash. The pre-rinse stayed ice cold but the wash water warmed up over time until it was steaming hot. Not hot right at the start so it does not pre-heat like some dishwashers, but with such long cycles that shouldn't make a difference.10. It beeps. It beeps when you start it, it beeps every minute when the door is open to remind you to close it and start the cycle, and it beeps a bunch of times when it's finished. And no, you can't turn the beep off. Grr. At least it's not a particularly loud beep.In conclusion, some compromises (and some extra-frustratingly the result of rather short-sighted decisions by Danby that are really unnecessary), but does a very good job of washing dishes, is very quiet, and - if you shop around - is an outstanding bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27TEWR46DQZLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFZEU6A#wasThisHelpful","R27TEWR46DQZLZ","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The kit itself comes with a variety of sliders and accessories, so good functionality. The mediocre rating is for the instructions - truly worse than useless, and that's a stretch in this age of ""Chinenglish"" translations. These instructions are in perfect English, clearly written by a native speaker. Too bad the author could not find the time to focus on INSTRUCTIONS. I did not buy this kit to learn about the history of the zipper...but I would genuinely liked to have known how to deduce which of the many styles of Stops to use, and how to install them. I would have liked to have known how to insert the slider (I tried pushing it onto both sides of the zipper at once, tried hand-assembling (!!!) the first inch of the zipper before sliding it on, upon finding that impossible tried against my better judgement inserting both sides into the slide upside down - which worked, but now the zipper unzipped going up instead of going down - turns out that you insert only one side, and that being the side that has the free bottom end), etc. I spent a good 90 minutes figuring all of this out when one picture (of a modern zipper being repaired along with its stop instead of antique zippers I do not and never will need to repair) and one sentence would have had it fixed in 90 seconds. By the way, I did eventually figure out that I could use one type of Stop to simply crimp-on, but the numerous other Stops that have little slotted tabs hanging off...never did figure those out.Here's another hint: Stops are in short supply in this kit, only two of each kind but numerous sliders and pulls so you will run out of Stops right away. Well, at least for a jacket zipper, I discovered (too late) that you don't actually need a stop on the side that doesn't have the slider when unzipped; while the original zipper comes with a Stop on both sides, the second one is just for show. For a jacket (whose zipper comes completely apart, as opposed to say a pair of pants where the two halves of the zipper remain attached to one another at the bottom) it actually wasn't even necessary to remove the original Stop on the non-zipper side; had I known that, I would have left one of the two Stops on in the first place. I could have saved a Stop for later use, and now I don't have another one of that type.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6I4WF1UTWMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001DUQFU#wasThisHelpful","R1O6I4WF1UTWMB","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The current buzzword in home automation is ""Z-Wave"" technology, in which every single device is a miniature router that can command, receive commands from, and forward commands onto any other device. It follows an industry standard, so every device works with every other device no matter who manufactured it.Or, so they say in the ads. But here's the terrible dark secret: while the HARDWARE may be inter-compatible, the PROGRAMMERS are not - and you have to have a special separate programmer to make them work. And to get two devices made by different manufacturers to work, you need a universal programmer, costing hundreds of dollars, connected to a laptop running a special application, and have been specially trained in the Z-Wave programming language.How did I find out all of this? Take a guess!In the end, I came back to the old (practically ancient, in fact - mid 1980s!), reliable, analog standby, X10. No, I can't push a single button to turn on one thing while it dims another and turns off two other things on the other side of the house...but I didn't really need to. I needed to turn on a ceiling light in my bedroom that I couldn't get to, and this works. They were on different circuits and did not communicate at first, so I had to switch a circuit breaker from one side of the electrical panel to the other. But at least you don't have to be Z-Wave factory-certified to know how to do that. So I got another one to turn the drop lights I just installed in my gym on and off and at the same time turn my flatscreen TV on and off, using the excellent (although oddly shaped) X10 wall-mount keypanel controller, which you can change keypads to and have it control or dim one, two, or four different things without having to replace the whole unit.The inline receiver module is big and clunky, you'll need a big deep box to mount it in (it completely crams a standard one-gang plastic rectangular box to the brim),  and like all X10 devices it makes a startling loud click when the relay activates. But it's simple, and it's inexpensive, and it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T78MJBCG5B3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HNKK5O#wasThisHelpful","R1T78MJBCG5B3T","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not quite pocket sized but almost. Claims IPX7 waterproof but haven't challenged that yet. Extremely well made, excellent feel.To change from one setting to another (low, medium, bright, strobe, blinking SOS) you have to repeatedly tap the power button, over and over again. It is incredibly annoying, so annoying I'd almost not carry it because of the difficulty in using it. Except......Except that it actually remembers the last setting you used! If you usually use it on medium, then the next time you turn it on, it will come on already set to medium. That is a brilliant (pun intended) solution.It is not without its nitpicks. The charging cable doesn't plug directly in, but through a snap-on adapter over the power button. I suspect this is to maintain waterproofness, but it unfortunately means that you cannot stand the flashlight on its end when the adapter is snapped on (and if you unsnap the quite small adapter, that's one more thing to lose). The instructions did not explain how to attach the provided lanyard, but thirty seconds of studying the situation solved that one (two small slots on either side of the power button, either one will do). And the focusing mechanism is just a slide in-and-out tube, not a twist-and-focus like higher end lamps. That's not enough to deduct a star when compared to its extremely competitive price.It is quite dim at lowest setting - more like a nightlight - and at highest setting is is nowhere near the intensity of one of the more powerful modern multi-LED units; about as bright as a four- or five-D cell incandescent police torch (which was considered really bright just a few years ago) but a quarter the size, a tenth the weight, and rechargeable. Charger and cable are included, but if you own a Kindle or a non-Apple cell phone, you already have those.Check to see if the vendor is including a battery.

But if the wall plate has a female jack and the back of my computer has a female jack, guess how I connect them? That's right, with this male to male cable. If you want the cable to actually perform some kind of logic like getting two computers to talk to each other then this isn't it, and since the description says nothing that even implies that this is what this cable does, shame on the fools who have the gall to give this product one star for not doing something that nobody ever said it could.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PFLO0BXQHCMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BSJFFC#wasThisHelpful","R1PFLO0BXQHCMJ","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Quieter than the Artic Cooling F9 I also bought, but almost double the price. Whether at full speed or throttled back, it is consistently quieter than the Artic while subjectively appearing to move about the same amount of air. As a replacement for a Wine Cooler (yes, these fans do appear in things other than PC cases), when the unit hits its temperature setpoint and dials back the fan speed, the SilenX is so quiet you have to put your ear to the unit to hear it. Not so the Artic - and the Artic was already far quieter than the original fan being replaced.One star off for claiming ""silent"" when it is definitely not, especially at speed.12/13/14 edit - down one more star.Now that winter is here, ambient conditions in my house don't require the wine cooler, or its fans, to work so hard. Very often, the fans come to a complete halt. And that's fine by me, I understand that at some voltage the fan cannot overcome its own resistance.But here's the problem: the SilenX, and >only< the SilenX, emits a whiny buzzing noise when it is stopped! The Artic stops at about the same time - very often I notice (walking down the stairs behind the unit so you can see the fans through the grille) both fans at a standstill, but only the SilenX is making any noise.End of story: after only two months, the SilenX went into the trash and I installed a second Artic. Both red and white wine zone fans now stop at the same time, and both silently. If you need a fan running all the time, the SilenX is a tad quieter at a good deal more cost. If your fan may be slowing down sometimes enough to possibly stop, get the Artic and save some money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTMKZ6H2S1KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZF65E0#wasThisHelpful","RFTMKZ6H2S1KW","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to the stock external fans that came with my wine cooler (yes, they use these things for stuff other than tower PCs), it was indeed a little quieter. But when the wine cooler is first cooling down and the fan is kicked into high gear, it was many times louder than the other fan I purchased (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZF65E0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the other zone. My internal fans I used 80mm units from here on Amazon that had their own mini-speed controller, but I couldn't find a completely adjustable 92mm. In any event, even when doing the initial cooldown the other fan was quieter, and upon reaching temperature setpoint the other fan really was silent while the Artic F9 was audible, although certainly quiet.12/13/14 update: sigh, there is no perfect solution. Now that's it's colder, the fans in my wine cooler work a lot less hard and often come to a complete stop. The ""other"" fan emits a whiny buzz when stopped while the Artic is dead silent. So pick your poison, one is quieter when turning, and the Artic is quieter when not turning. If your fan may be going so slowly as to stop completely, get the Artic and save some money.That does not earn the Artic any additional stars, but it did cost its competitor a star. It did, however, earn the Artic an extra sale: I bought another one to replace the buzzy red ""silent"" fan, which went into the trash.

"Got at Home Depot for a decent price, not quite as low as the best price on Amazon but close.It was, I suppose, quiet, but not nearly silent. But I also have another brand, much larger (36 bottles) and it is far louder especially when first chilling down so I suppose this is one of the quieter units. Nonetheless, I did not understand why it should make any noise at all and I replaced all four fans (two internal, two external, or two top zone and two bottom zone) with ultra-quiet fans purchased here on Amazon. The internal 80mm fans I replaced with fans that have their own speed control, so I dialed them down to the fastest speed that is inaudible. The external fans I replaced with the quietest-rated 92mm fans sold on Amazon and wired them in series, which cut their speed in half. The result: absolute, complete silence for an additional $36 and some elbow grease; and still quickly cools down to 55 degrees. So it is definitely possible to make a truly silent cooler: one star off for cheap fans.And as mentioned by other reviewers, the unit does forget what temperature you set it to when the power does out (I was unplugging and reconnecting mine a lot while I was improving the fans). Not worth a whole star off so I'd rate it overall 3- 1/2 stars if I could.EDIT: while replacing the internal fans with adjustable-speed units was a total success, I learned something about the external fans. I noticed that the temperature of one of the zones was suddenly above room temperature (!) and the top of the unit was noticeably warm. It turns out that when the inside temperature reaches the preset, the unit automatically decreases voltage to the external fans - enough that one of them no longer had enough juice to keep turning while wired in series. I reconnected them back to their independent connectors like they were intended to be, and while they were definitely audible during cool-down (still much quieter than the original fans), once the unit reached the preset temperature they became essentially silent; I have to put my head right up to the unit to hear anything. Overall I would say the new fans (wired correctly a.k.a each fan to its respective power jack) while cooling down are about as loud as the original fans were when at setpoint, and once at setpoint the new fans are essentially silent. All of these situations are of course vastly quieter than the original fans were during cooldown, which was quite noticeable even in a fairly noisy room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPPZS6K8R7UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNSO41M#wasThisHelpful","R1KPPZS6K8R7UT","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This must be the ultimate ""fully objective"" review, because I am giving the J&J tape four stars even though it did not work for me at all. It did indeed go on easily, sticks well to itself but hardly at all to my skin (a pretty important characteristic), and when applied as per the instructions held my foot in position quite solidly. But a) it does contain latex and I and so many others are allergic, so when removed my skin was red (quickly went away) and b) my foot hurt like hell when walking, but that's probably because this isn't the right cure - my doctor later recommended heel lifts for my Achilles's tendonitis and those are helping, the tape is of course for injuries where preventing flexion is the cure and that turned out not to be my problem.

"Received as a present the smaller pan. I was really psyched because it is a genuinely well-made, sturdy little guy. However, it burns everything (I have an electric range - perhaps people with gas would fare better) and everything sticks. Things that I would not have imagined. For example: the main use for this is when I am alone on weekends I make myself breakfast: heat up a can of corned beef hash, and then use the same pan to fry an egg. Hash is quite oily, you cannot say that the pan is not well-greased when it is done. But not only does the egg stick like glue to the ""well-oiled"" pan, but even the potatoes in the hash does. Yes, I know, the Internet shows ways to prepare a stainless pot to reduce sticking, but they overlook a basic fact: I'm lazy. And unlike cast iron pots, which you season once and then as long as you keep them away from a dishwashing machine they're basically set for life, the articles I have read (and remember, I'm lazy, so I'm already exhausted just from having to do research on a $^&%$^%$!! pan) say that stainless has to be continuously seasoned.And what's more, they say something else: avoid high heat like the plague, because stainless will warp when exposed to high temperature differentials. Apparently, putting a hot stainless pot under running water can permanently ruin it.None of this diatribe, by the way, is directly at Begique: I wound up getting the hard-enameled version of this set (on-sale at Macy's for about what this set costs here on Amazon), slightly thinner bottom. Have not had them long enough to comment on longevity but has the same massive handle and appear to be very well made (I'd include a link but frustratingly, Amazon doesn't seem to carry them). Worked perfectly and very happy. Keeping the steel pan because for certain things such as sauteing onions, the heat control  offered by that thick aluminum bottom really is superior. If it weren't for that I'd have given just two stars, but if you want a general-purpose pan and not cookware that fills a very niche product, you may want to steer clear of this and perhaps all stainless steel skillets.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3SYZX3OJ5E2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FK0K0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3T3SYZX3OJ5E2","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well made, replaced my godawful Panasonic thermal carafe.

"The drive itself is fine.

"You can find my highly detailed review of the GW77 posted separately under the now-discontinued U.S. model posting. I gave it two stars for a number of defects, including an annoying tendency to turn itself off in the middle of use - apparently a common problem. My two stars was also based on the price of nearly $800, and I wound up returning it. I did state that I would reconsider my rating if Sony were to update its software to fix some of the glaring problems - which they never did, they just dropped it.Or so it seemed, but the GW77 lived on in Japan. Yes, it's still a 5MP camera masquerading as 20MP, and although I have not tried its low-lux setting I bet it still stinks taking stills in low light with no flash (but it has an excellent, adjustable flash). And it is still touchscreen-only, making shooting underwater a bit of a hassle because the touchscreen is disabled underwater. But the Japanese version is far cheaper - no import duty, for some reason - and most definitely has a new firmware, because it has features like ""take a picture when two people smile"" that weren't in its U.S. incarnation.And more to the point, they work! As I admitted in my original review, and in comparisons in my Amazon review of the vastly inferior Panasonic WA03/WA30 (the closest thing the GW77 has to an underwater competitor), this thing takes movies, in good light and poor, that you would think came from a $10,000 camera. Underwater (when set correctly, although that's a lot of menu items that of course cannot be done underwater) it is not going to appear in the next episode of ""Planet Earth"" but still amazingly good for such a small package. It still comes with that useless GPS feature that made the U.S. version so expensive, and it is, of course, entirely in Japanese. I have the Japanese manual and the U.S. manual (both available as free PDFs if you Google them) and can, for the most part, match up the icons to figure out what is what...but the menus are not identical (for one thing, the Japanese-only unit has no ""select language"" setting) so that doesn't always work, and there are some settings with no icons that lead to screens that I have not, as yet, figured out. But for several hundred dollars less that I originally paid, I can live with that I just wish they could have fixed the U.S. version - and lowered the price!But do check out my original review (<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00863R36W/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1#cm_cr_dpwidget>, two star review titled ""Going back to Amazon"") so you know the pros and cons of this particular camera, it is not for everybody and if you don't need underwater capability, there may be better choices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MUCH7ZQ2MLLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YACGOM#wasThisHelpful","R1MUCH7ZQ2MLLI","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You must always connect it to the grille FIRST, then to the cylinder. That's easy so long as you remember it! Disconnecting is a bit trickier: you must always disconnect it from the cylinder FIRST, but now it is secured to both the cylinder and the grille so if you simply start unscrewing it, whichever one is the loosest is the one that is going to come off; so you have to make sure you hold the adapter (or put a wrench on it) to ensure you disconnect the cylinder, not the grille. Otherwise, gas will come blowing out and possibly ignite.Oh, and make sure you keep the cylinder upright at all times - while connecting and disconnecting it; and while using it, put the cylinder into a stand or otherwise make sure it stays upright, otherwise it's not gas that will be coming out but concentrated liquid.

Wanted something smaller to carry while walking - a full-size tennis racquet is simply not convenient - and gave the OneShot a try.Well, it is smaller, but just. Think ""super extra large borderline cheating racquetball racquet."" And the handle is very big, not so much long as wide. Which is surprising, considering it takes the same two AA batteries as other units. It does have the definite advantage of having the batteries load from the end, rather than the side, so the battery door release isn't constantly sticking you in the palm while carrying it.MUCH lower voltage/power than my prior unit (whose advertising makes a point of its power); the OneShot gives a modest pop and a dead or dying insect falls to the ground; while an insect contacting the Zap Master explodes into a brilliant blue flash and anything less than a horsefly left nothing but a puff of smoke.Finally, safety. I have already gotten zapped twice by having my fingers pressing into the mesh. Okay, that was stupid of me, right? But here's the thing: this was AFTER I had released the zap button. The Zap Master drains the charge when you release the button, rendering the mesh harmless, while the OneShot apparently retains the charge for some time afterward. Dangerous?

"Lots of gizmos that allow different sources to be connected to a single monitor, a capability that is rapidly becoming moot as more and more monitors are shipping with multiple HDMI inputs. Not so many gizmos that do the opposite, allowing a single source to switch between different monitors. This particular gizmo does both, and does it well.To be extremely, exceedingly, absolutely clear: you will not be able to watch video on two monitors at the same time with this. While it is theoretically possible, most of the video in the world that is flowing through an HDMI cable happens to be copyrighted and therefore copy protected (HDCP). There are schemes to allow HDCP video on two monitors at the same time (my Kindle Fire in combination with my Netgear Push2TV does it) but a) only under certain circumstances and b) only in the way the copyright owner wants it, not the way you want it. (For example, I can see video on my Kindle and on one and only one monitor - the Push2TV still doesn't allow the signal to go to more than one monitor.) So if you want to display an HDMI signal on two monitors at once, this device won't do it, and you may have to lower your expectations because of the technological limitations mandated by copyright laws.For me, I usually have my HTPC connected to both my living room TV and a monitor down in the gym. No, I still can't watch both at once, but Windows 7 makes it easy to instantly switch between them. But I sometimes play Flight Simulator and use a little touchscreen monitor to display the instruments. It's a hassle to have to dig behind the HTPC to switch cables, so the Portta with a little 1-foot cable is just the ticket.  I use the Windows-P key combination to toggle to ""extend desktop,"" push the button on the front of the Portta, and now I have a live HDMI jack I can plug into. When I'm finished playing, I just reverse the procedure and I can still watch Mad Men in the living room or P90X in the gym.Using the Portta to do the opposite - to allow one monitor to switch between two different HDMI sources, say a cable box and a BluRay player - is just as easy. Be aware, however, that the Portta does not ""automatically"" switch between sources (so for example if you turn the power on to the BluRay player, the Portta does not recognize that you want to watch BluRay and switch over to that source). There are other switches that do that, some sold here on Amazon. As I said, this particular functionality is rapidly becoming moot: even my little 20"" touchscreen came with two HDMI inputs.One minus, but not enough to deduct a whole star: Portta has unfortunately followed the fashionable trend of having a really, really bright blue LED shining into your eyes. As in, bright enough to read by. I will probably get around to putting a piece of electrical tape over it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMS0GNZP0UH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO1GMNU#wasThisHelpful","R3PMS0GNZP0UH0","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, this is MISLABELED as of this date - the product information says it is for 3/8, 1/2, and 1/4"" fittings; it should state ""and 3/4"" (if you click on the image that shows the reverse of the package and zoom in you'll see that this is exactly what it says on the package, it's the Amazon description that is wrong). Also be aware that when they say 1/2"" they mean a pipe that is not at all 1/2"", it's another one of those crazy ""National Pipe"" dimensions, so measure your pipe and Google ""National Pipe OD"" to make sure you really have a 3/8 or a 1/2 or a 3/4 pipe. Yeah, it drives me crazy, too.Anyway, my situation was that I had a pipe fitted into a union that had never been soldered, and it had rusted internally so much that I couldn't get a good solder joint. Unfortunately that left me with a pipe with a bit of solder adhered to the bottom, ruining its perfectly circular profile; and the LeakMate needs a perfect circle. To be specific, the clamp comes with several rubber sleeve inserts to adopt it to different pipe sizes, and these sleeves have a small step-down to match the corresponding pipe union. This step-down has to fit over the place where the pipe enters the union EXACTLY (at least on the 3/4"", which being the largest has the least amount of rubber; the sleeves for the smaller pipe sizes have a lot more rubber so they might be more forgiving). So all I accomplished was to slow, but not stop, the leak, which I finally fixed using the excellent Rectorseal pipe repair kit (also from Amazon - do a search).Nonetheless, I am keeping the LeakMate because I can see that it might be a lifesaver some day. You should not consider the LeakMate as in any way a permanent fix but rather something to ""mostly"" fix a problem pending a permanent solution. I have to subtract a star because it is, as of this date, mislabeled; and another star because it did not work for me (and my situation is surely not unique).

"Tried the rubber patch with the radiator hose clamps; tried the U-clamp with the liners; tried soldering. They all slowed the leak but did not stop it. I have a baseboard forced-hot water radiator installed by, well, let's just say a less-than-attentive contractor who was never heard from again; and one of the pipes was never soldered into its union, resulting in a rapid drip whenever the heat comes on. This was in the dead of winter so I wasn't too eager to shut my heating down in order to drain the system and properly solder. Big mistake; the aforementioned rubber tube patch only slowed it down, and by the time the summer came along, the inner surfaces of the copper union had rusted, making a good solder seal impossible. I guess if I was a plumber I'd have access to a strong acid that could have stripped the corrosion inside the union joint clean, but a blow torch and flux couldn't get in where it was needed, and I don't have the skill to disassemble and re-solder the whole thing. The LeakMate U-clamp/lining gizmo might have worked if I had not already tried unsuccessfully to solder the pipe, but now I had solder adhering to the copper and making its profile not perfectly circular, which seems to be a requirement for the LeakMate (the shape of the clamp needs to align exactly with the profile of the pipe) so again, it slowed but not completely stopped the leak.The Rectorseal stopped the leak dead, both static and with the heat and recirculation pump running. You do need to rough up the pipe surface (coarse sandpaper) and you need to have everything ready - included gloves on, a bowl of water by your side, lots of paper towels - because once you start you are committed and you need to work quickly, splashing water on your gloves and the joint occasionally, winding the tape back and fourth and giving it a good, gradual pull after every wrap. It supposedly sets in 30 minutes but I gave it several hours to be on the safe side before re-pressurizing the line, but not a drop since then.The reason for four stars instead of five is because the outermost eight inches of the tape spool had already dried out and set, and had to be cut off and thrown away. Fortunately the remainder was more than enough for my situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8M80WRDJ9DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B04SME#wasThisHelpful","R3O8M80WRDJ9DB","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Banged my plantar fascia during P90X (jumping) and felt something pop loose inside my heel. I've done it before but this time it didn't get better after a few days, with blinding Achilles pain first thing in the morning, limping up and down stairs, even pain in the opposite leg caused by compensating for my limp. Tried a set of strap-on in-shoe orthodics during the day - helped but didn't cure...and gave me a sore calf, and gives no support going uphill, and way too much support (like bouncing on a ball) going downhill. Tried a big fuzzy splint from Amazon during the night - helped but too hot, if the pain wasn't keeping me awake then a sweating foot was, and obviously did not keep me from re-aggravating the tendon while walking. But the Footminder really has made a difference, after two months I'm 90% better (I even went for a short jog today with them today, unimaginable a month ago) and I am seriously considering continuing to use them even after I'm cured. I liked them so much, I bought a second pair so I don't have to keep switching them between shoes.My only complaint, and I honestly don't know how they could have designed them to account for this (so no star subtracted), is they do slip down inside the shoe when I am putting the shoe on so I have to hold the shoe at an awkward angle to keep the Footminder near the heel while I get my foot inside. Once my foot is in, however, the arch of my foot forces the arch of the Footminder to naturally drift into and stay in the correct position.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LZLT9WEWG7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWG64QG#wasThisHelpful","R19LZLT9WEWG7X","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good: extremely light, good picture. Touch works very well. Love the fold-out stand, which worked perfectly for me - I wanted this to serve as a temporary second monitor when I play Flight Simulator (so I can display my virtual aircraft's control panel next to me and actually change my instruments and switches by physically touching them - works terrific, and although I have to set my monitors up so that Windows thinks my secondary monitor is the primary each time, that's a Microsoft thing and not in any way this monitor's fault) but when I'm not playing, I fold in the stand and return the monitor to my VESA-compatible wall mount that I use to broadcast Netflix to through my Netgear Push2TV. One of the smallest monitors out there that's true 1080P.The bad: A touch small for the wall application, but that's a matter of taste. You've also read other reviews about how tinny the speakers are (true) and at least one reviewer recommending that you plug an external set of speakers into the monitor. That reviewer should have actually tried that before making that recommendation, because unfortunately it is quite impossible: the 1/8"" audio jack on the back of the monitor is a stereo INPUT not an OUTPUT. There is no way to hook a set of speakers up to this monitor, and it needs it pretty badly. Audio in is far less important since it already receives audio through the HDMI connection (which also carries audio) and fewer and fewer users are going to need a separate audio in, but the poor speakers demand an audio out for any serious multimedia application. Lacks scaling options, which are a standard feature on just about every other HDMI monitor, but which is becoming less important as ""underscanning/overscaling"" becomes a forgotten technology so probably not a concern.The neutral: glossy screen sure to show fingerprints, but that's true of all touchscreens. Powered by a small power brick instead of a cord directly in; I prefer the simplicity of a single cord but I took a couple of sticky tabs and just glued the little brick to the back of the monitor, so for all practical purposes it's the same as having a cord plugging directly in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN84C50KF64MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I14DPC2#wasThisHelpful","RN84C50KF64MG","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caught about one bug per minute until I a) cleared some brush so it could be seen in all directions, b) lifted it up to head-level (eye hooks into two trees, ran a ratchet rope between them, and hoisted it up), and c) wedged a block of octanol (from Home Depot) between the bars. I found a Black Flag octanol unit here on Amazon that clips to a zapper and I'll use that when the current one runs out. The first night it rained and still almost no hits, and I started to lose hope. But the next night, and every night since, it has been a non-stop fireworks show. The fun dies down around midnight so I put it on the excellent Woods timer <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002NB2X/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1> that lets me set it to turn off four hours after sundown. I still get daytime mosquitoes biting me and perhaps I'll try alternating octanol with Lurex (I understand that they don't work well together, but so far I only see Lurex in cartridges intended to be used with units with fans) but fortunately the vast majority of mosquitoes in my area seem to be drawn straight to the combination of octanol and 120 watts of bug inferno. Sometimes it almost sounds like rain, the bugs are being zapped so incessantly.It comes with hardware to hang it horizontally, but for the life of me I have no idea why anyone would ever want to do that. Doing so would block the light in two directions (and so reduce its effectiveness in drawing pests) and you can accomplish the exact same thing by simply removing the bottom cover and leaving it off - while the sides are covered in heavy wire, the top and bottom (under the plastic covers) are covered in strips of heavy flat steel. Dead bugs just fall right through (well, those whose bodies survive in some form, mosquitoes are mostly just turned into smoke).Comments on other reviews:First, ignore the idiot who said this is flimsy and held together by a tiny screw. He never actually removed that screw (and the top), otherwise he'd have known that the top mount screws into not the plastic cover but the massive steel frame hidden under the cover.Second, I've read the post that the starter and bulbs need to be replaced and are difficult to replace. I have not had this long enough to have an opinion on that so I'll assume that his review is accurate. Nonetheless, I still stick with my five stars: for me, if I have to throw this entire thing away every year and buy a new one, it would still be worth every penny to me for its incredible effectiveness. I've tried the others and $250 spent on something that works is better than $40 wasted on something that doesn't.I'm not saying I want to replace it every year, and I'm hoping I don't have to; but it would definitely be worth it.

"Didn't write a review right away as I saw some had complained about consistent operation and I wanted to check it out first. I note that the number one reason given by people writing one-star reviews is something to the effect of ""didn't work,"" but I suspect most of them did not actually give the product a fair try. I say that because if you simply plug it in and cover the optical sensor expecting it to immediately turn on, it won't and you might think the unit is defective. But in reality, it could not turn on immediately because unlike a regular photocell such as a entrance light, this thing also has to start counting down a timer. If you think about it, before it can start the timer it has to know that it is actually dark, and not just seeming to be dark because perhaps a tree blocked the setting sun for a moment. So it pauses for a moment (actually about 20 seconds) before the unit switches on and starts the timer, which is exactly how it should be. On the other hand I also see some poor reviews for units that stopped working weeks or months later and it's more difficult to mark those up to poor understanding of operation; if mine dies I'll update this review.

"I bought this to connect a Netgear Push2TV <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00904JILO/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1> directly to my HD TV set. The Netgear puts out a signal through an HDMI port, but also requires a USB cable to provide power.

I only rate this as 4 stars because the USB and HDMI connectors point in opposite directions between the TV and the Push2TV, and the Hoye adapter would have had to point in the wrong direction (i.e., the Push2TV hanging in front of the TV instead of behind it). However, because the USB adapter both rotates as well as swivels, I was able to rotate the USB adapter around so that it changed orientation 180 degrees, and then both the HDMI and USB adapters line up with connectors on both the TV and the Push2TV. The USB adapter therefore got five stars for its extra flexibility that saved the day, while the Hoye gets four stars for being a very good, but not quite as spectacular, accessory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BND66V3C3IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2WEKZK#wasThisHelpful","R38BND66V3C3IH","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On a lark - I realized the probability of this crazy idea actually working was slim to none - I ordered this along with a similar (folding, but not twisting) HDMI connector <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C2WEKZK/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1>.

The connectors on the TV are almost the same distance apart as they are on the Push TV, so they all align. Unfortunately, the USB connectors and the HDMI connectors face in opposite directions; so it was a godsend that the YCS adapter happens to also be able to rotate, so the USB connector on the other end now faces the same direction as the HDMI.Now I can broadcast my Kindle Fire wirelessly to my TV in high definition video and sound, without having any cables dangling off the side of my TV. It was specifically the rotating characteristic of the YCS adapter that made it work. I therefore gave the HDMI adapter four stars for its good, but not spectacular, flexibility and five stars to the YCS for saving the day with its multi-axis capabilities.I cannot yet speak to longevity, but at least in my case the total combined weight of the Netgear, the YCS, and the HDMI adapter is less that a few ounces so I don't expect any difficulties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWYECC8R88HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5K1G0C#wasThisHelpful","R2UWYECC8R88HX","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Work, that is. I suspect that the reviewers giving this item high marks did not actually try it out with all connectors. I will try to upload a photo showing the problem (edit: uploaded, depending on your browser you may have to scroll down on the main product page to see the thumbnail), but: the big connector that plugs into your available power connector is ever-so-slightly too wide to then plug into a SATA drive and leave enough room for a data cable to plug in alongside it. Looking at the picture, you'll see that the data cable is pushed all the way up against the main connector body but still cannot quite reach the data terminal on the hard drive. I am baffled why they would have designed it so, just 2mm off the side (the side opposite the four colored wires) would have been enough. You might be able to make it work with a very low-profile right-angle data connector, but a standard straight cable just doesn't fit. In all probability, you'll need to hook your third drive up to this with a male-to-female extension cable, kind of defeating the ""all in one"" concept.On the other hand, it makes for a fine two-way power splitter, and as I said could possibly be used as a three-way splitter with some degree of finagling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3WHDY7FQQP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Y557UM#wasThisHelpful","R1J3WHDY7FQQP2","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The basic part itself is excellent. But:1. I was expecting it to have some sort of rubber lining to protect the mirror surface, but it does not. The way this works is you install the actual clip first, and then the round cover screws down around that. That cover is brushed nickel, which will easily (let me rephrase that, ""inevitably"") scratch or even break the mirror. There is an easy solution, not described in the scanty instructions: first of all, obviously don't torque down the cover hard; it is, after all, just a cover. Secondly, as the cover closes in on the mirror surface, use your other hand to push the mirror back against the wall and DO NOT let the cover actually touch the mirror while you are still twisting the cover on. When you release the mirror, it will spring back slightly and press lightly against the cover. (Which means that the mirror and the cover are simply pressing against each other, which is okay, and not that you actually ground the cover into the mirror while you were screwing it on.)2. As others have mentioned, this thing won't hold a mirror of any size whatsoever; not because of the clamps, but because of the little short screws and terrible anchors. Get longer screws and if possible run the bottom clamps straight into a stud (because you'll want to make the clips symmetrical, that might not be possible depending on where you want the mirror to hang - in my case, I was able to run one into a stud but not the other). Otherwise, get a ""real"" anchor, I used a toggle bolt for the non-stud one. Don't go cheap on this one, because even if the anchor is structurally sound the clip will ""droop"" under the mirror's weight and you will see a gap between the mirror and the cover - which will of course look twice as big as it really is, because you'll see the gap and its reflection! (Experience talking here.)  The anchors on the top don't really matter, it's the bottom two that take the weight and tend to droop or worse. Whatever anchor you use on the bottom, make sure that it is METAL and big enough so that the clamp physically presses up against the metal of the anchor. Why? Because if it is plastic, and/or the anchor is so small that the clamp touches the drywall, then when you start to tighten the screw in the clamp you'll start to pry the anchor back out. No, the anchor will not and cannot actually come all the way back out of the wall (the anchor and your screw both tighten in the same direction), but possibly enough to result in the dreaded ""droop."" If you have a good, sturdy anchor but the contact area is too small or non-existent (for example, when you screw straight into a stud then the only thing the clamp will contact is, by definition, drywall) then put a flat washer between the wall and the clamp.Why on Earth did I give this four stars with all the apparent hassles? Because none of this is the clip's fault, and they certainly can't be expected to include every kind of anchor to address every possible situation. If you follow my instructions to avoid scratching the mirror and to provide a rock-solid anchor with metal-on-metal contact for the bottom two, you will be very happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1VH1HYKY7GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G14VES#wasThisHelpful","R1T1VH1HYKY7GB","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Full disclosure: despite what it may say above this review, I do not own an island purchased from Amazon; my horror story of what Amazon's customer service put me through is explained in a separate ""vendor feedback"" review and I ultimately purchased this, for less money and zero hassle, through Wayfair. This review is only about the product itself.Really nice design, except bottoms of drawers could be sturdier. I do wish the side attachments were designed to be put on or left off at your discretion (cannot be left off without leaving large holes in the side). I bought some white screw-in hooks and converted the left attachment to a mug rack, four mugs above and four hanging beneath. This is not a center island, doors are only on the front - I mention this because I wanted something to go against a wall and it was actually difficult for me to figure out from the descriptions which islands did, and did not, have doors on both sides. Both wheels and feet are included. The feet, by the way, do not actually touch the floor but terminate in a small rubbery circle, so I am not sure which would be better at distributing the weight (with the granite top this is very heavy) if you have a floor that can be easily damaged - probably a felt pad would be a good idea in either case.VERY well packed (including the top coming in a massive wood frame for protection) - and that excellent packaging is, in a way, the reason for my unimpressive review. You see, there were lots of nicks and dings, and one panel completely crushed. Now, that panel is on the left, inside, and cannot be seen without getting down on your knees and had no functional impact - which is very suspicious. I work in quality assurance and I know that companies will have criteria about what can and cannot pass, and it is common that even a major defect, if not visible and non-functional, will be allowed through. And some of the dings were on the edges of doors, and on top of the shelf that the aforementioned mugs are sitting (which could not be flipped over to hide the ding as there are big holes in the bottom of that shelf to hold the towel accessory). That last one is missing paint so it occurred after the shelf was already painted. Most, if not all, of these dings and the big crack could not have occurred during shipment because the whole thing is extremely well packed and protected - a forklift tine driven trough the box might shatter a panel but not cause paint gouge off a shelf.Yes, I know that this is an assemble-by-numbers and not an heirloom piece of furniture.

"The product itself deserves five stars. Yes, I can certainly see why people would be disappointed if their particular glasses use an oddball screw size that this doesn't accomodate...but that's really a critique of the eyeglasses, isn't it? Shouldn't they instead go back and give their eyeglasses a one-star review for using non-standard screw sizes?And ignore the people who say it doesn't (or worse, ""cannot"") work on spring hinges: of course it can, they just didn't bother reading the helpful hints posted by other reviewers. In fact, the design makes it far far FAR easier to use on spring hinges than a regular screw would, if you spend a minute reading the reviews to understand how to do it. I'll even repeat it here: insert the long screw shaft at an angle so it bridges both halves of the hinge mount. As you push the screw in with the screwdriver, the screw shaft becomes a lever that naturally pivots the two halves together. Damned clever (just go slow and gentle, because that shaft is, after all, designed to break off under force). Obviously if you have a spring hinge that also happens to use a size screw not included with this kit you're still out of luck.But one star off because once you use up the handful of screws (and if they indeed come in different sizes - I'd need a microscope to confirm that! - then make that ""one or two screws"") that come with the kit, then you have to buy the whole kit again.

"Just installed so I cannot really rate it for the claimed dependability (kind of hard to objectively classify how well it withstands punctures without doing controlled experiments anyway). But I did want to post about how difficult it is to get these to mount - and a quick trick around that. 1.50"" is at the extreme low end of this tube's stated size, and there was simply too much tube to cram inside the tire. Try as I might, I wound up with several inches of extra tube with no place to put it. the first one I eventually got on with innumerable air filling and deflation cycles, but even then I had to keep breaking the tire bead and re-adjusting to get the valve stem square.On my second one, I tried an idea. I left the tire UNMOUNTED (one side on the wheel, the other hanging off) and inflated it to 40 PSI. I then deflated the tube, pushed it under the tire, pushed the second tire bead onto the wheel, and inflated to 60. Perfect fit that time.EDIT: My initial experience was rather negative as I found it was much more difficult to pedal with these installed. To be honest, I also had bought new tires so I could not at first definitively blame the tube or the tire. I also found that these tubes lose pressure rather quickly, initially dropping 10psi in a day - and since that happened on four tubes on two bikes, not a fluke. (After a while the pressure drop decreased considerably, so I suspect the valves were seating.) The solution to the hard rolling was to overinflate the tires, they're rated to 65psi max and I am inflating them to 80psi (a quick check on the Internet found that bike tires are deliberately rated far below their actual maximum inflation values). Which fixed the difficult rolling problem - but I wonder if by having to overinflate I haven't negated the puncture-resistance I was after in the first place.What it boils down to is this: these might be fine for a balloon tire around the tube's nominal size (I note others here had problems on the other end of the spectrum with tires around the tube's maximum stated size), but cramming them into a 1.50 is just too problematic.7/13/15 UPDATE: Been using them for two years now, and although I've only put about four or five hundred miles on my bike, they're coming off. In that time I have not gotten a single flat, so they do seem to work; but even maxed out at 80+ psi in a 40-65psi tire, they're tough rolling. When I tried to remove the tube, it had to be dragged out of the tire and when it fell on the floor, it still looked like it was fully inflated (usually an uninflated bike inner tube looks like a wet piece of spaghetti). Perhaps with a tire size more matched to the tube's nominal might give a happier result, but while it works as promised - no flats - it just wasn't worth the effort (literally). I replaced the rears with the Sunlite 1.50-1.75 regular tubes and inflated to 65psi already saw a big relief in pedaling effort, and ordered another set to replace the fronts as well.So, which is more important to you:- Ease of pedaling your bike? Two stars.- Not getting flats? Four stars.- Both equally important? Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3R2VXX0FSC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AO7IA6#wasThisHelpful","R3A3R2VXX0FSC3","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to have a 2.5"" IDE drive with an IDE-to-USB adapter, and currently have a 2.5"" SATA SSD with a SATA-to-USB adapter. I use them for portable backups, and have often wondered why somebody doesn't simply squeeze the whole thing into a single package. I thought that what I had found when I ordered the Kingspec 32GB USB ""SSD"" - but I was wrong.I don't claim to be an expert on hard drive protocols, but I do know what a real SSD does and how it appears in various software system when connected to a USB port, and this ain't it. For example, when I connect an SSD to USB under Windows, I can create and delete partitions on it, and under Windows 7 I can resize them. Not so with this device; I was eventually able to figure out how to do so by using the tools in my backup software (Acronis) but not within Windows - and even then, only one partition was possible. And formatting it as anything other than FAT prevents it from booting, even though a ""real"" SSD boots fine when formatted as NTFS - which by the way is required if you want to have files bigger than 4GB (kind of important if the purpose is to store backups).And the list goes on. Despite the Amazon description, despite the box and graphics, this is in no way an SSD; it is a bootable flash drive (which, if I understand it, means that an identification bit is set that flags itself as non-removable; while it still shows up in Windows as ""removable,"" I can confirm that it shows up in my BIOS as a ""hard drive""). Now that may not be a bad thing (and the box claims dynamic wear leveling and mean time between failure rates that would be indicative of a genuine SSD - but since they are not completely honest about the first part...) and for some applications, e.g. under Linux, it might work very well indeed. But it is not a solid state drive in the sense that I think most people would expect, and 32GB bootable flash drives can be had for a lot less money.I'd send it back, but it came all the way from China (about a month for shipping) and it's not a bad bootable flash drive...but I wanted an SSD!","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6NJV6M3HP6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FX95S6#wasThisHelpful","RZ6NJV6M3HP6W","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, let's get this straight right away: I ordered this without fully reading the description. My fault. I have no need of a cache drive, since every computer I own already has a small SSD as its main O/S drive, with data (for computers that handle a lot of data) pointed to a larger magnetic drive. I ordered the wrong thing.But so long as I had it, on a lark (and because another poster here said it would work) I tried plugging it in and seeing if I could mount, format, and use it as a primary drive on a friend's Dell laptop. And sure enough, it worked under Windows 7.But it was too little capacity, since she has just the one drive; so I swapped it out for a 64GB Kingston I had on another PC, one with a 2TB Samsung for all my data and therefore largely going to waste. And the SanDisk worked perfectly there, too, under XP.So: zero experience with using this drive for what it is marketed for, and I did not play with the included software. But I can confirm that it is a very light, even smaller (thinner) than usual 3.5"" (it does come with an adapter plate if you need one), and lightning fast SSD that works plug-n-play in a variety of circumstances; and the price was cheaper than an equivalent sized ""proper"" SSD.One of my best mistakes ever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JSDBJEDC6DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U3038I#wasThisHelpful","R39JSDBJEDC6DB","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read my update, and then downgrade of this three-star review at the bottom.Saw these, of all places, at the pool restaurant at the Marriott in Kauai and had to talk my girlfriend out of stealing them, she liked them so much. For salt they are terrific for the table; but for pepper, they are a lot of work to get just a little out and there is no adjustment. I wondered if maybe one is specifically for salt and the other dedicated to pepper, but that's not the case: when one ran empty, I switched their contents and the other grinder still takes ten pumps to get even a little pepper out. DEFINITELY NOT for cooking (except as arm calisthenics!) but very attractive and unobtrusive at the serving table.At least, that is, for salt.-------------6/23/13 update: out of the blue, I was contacted by the manufacturer offering to send me another unit. I was frankly not interested, since as I describe above two out of two grinders exhibited poor grinding of pepper. But lo and behold, they sent me a new unit anyway; and it actually works perfectly.Which leads to an interesting ethical problem for me. Yes, it is fantastic that I now have a working pepper grinder, and even more fantastic that the company has such high regard for its customers (or its reputation, which boils down to the same thing). They didn't even ask for the old one back and I'll use that for salt by my BBQ grill.BUT, I nonetheless received two ""defectives."" What does that say about their quality control? I am a pharmaceutical quality engineer and I face these questions every day. It's hard to give this five stars when I have circumstantial evidence of a systemic quality issue. It's terribly unlikely (but nonetheless possible) that I received two bad units just by coincidence.But ultimately, coincidences do happen and I also have insufficient data to say that there IS an underlying quality issue, so I am going to give Epare the benefit of the doubt and credit them both for an excellent and attractive little grinder and outstanding customer service.----------------5/25/14 update: like many other reviewers have experienced, the little metal sleeve above the (plastic, not glass) window that lets you see how much salt or pepper remains came loose - on both units, almost simultaneously. It was an easy fix (drop of superglue) and I see several reviewers state that Epare has fixed the design flaw, but the fact is mine both came off - one star back off again down to four stars.----------------11/23/14 update: now the threads inside the top have stripped out so that the entire mechanism no longer works. Put it together, go to use it, and the plunger springs out like a Jack-in-the-Box. This is after about a year of very light use. How can that be, if it is stainless steel? Sloppy tolerances? Or the internal parts are not steel? In the trash it goes - along with the midget grinder I bought a few months ago, and already the plunger on that gets routinely stuck halfway depressed, I suspect a weak spring. Epare, you design a great product but your manufacturing sucks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132NZMGVV43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009G1RTX0#wasThisHelpful","R132NZMGVV43","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shame on the dozen or so people here who gave this product a single star - the absolute worst rating possible, meaning that nothing could possibly make the product any worse - because they failed to read the quite clearly stated pre- and post-cooking rice volume.However, the one-star reviews about this cooker dying shortly after purchase cannot be so easily ignored and are quite worrying. If that happens I will return and downgrade my review.For one or two (or three, if you don't eat a lot of rice) people, the size is downright perfect. The complaints about splattering can be instantly fixed (and B&D should add this to the instructions) by simply rinsing the rice beforehand: dump the rice into a strainer, run under water, dump rice into cooker, flip strainer over, rinse strainer, shake strainer dry and hang up. Twenty seconds and no more boilovers. I have read that pre-rinsed rice is healthier but I don't have an opinion on that; I just know that it keeps this cooker from splattering.Another point that other reviewers are sort-of right about is the confusing measurement - it is baffling! You mix in an ACTUAL amount of water with a deliberately WRONG amount of rice. This is the manual's fault, here's all you need to know: fill the rice measuring cup to the bottom of the lip and dump the rice into the cooker (er, after rinsing :-)  then fill the cooker with water up to the marked line. You don't need to know that the one-cup rice cup isn't actually one cup, that's irrelevant to using it - but the manual describes it as though it's something critically important.And yes, it is true that the rice on the bottom comes out brown. Thing is, it still tastes perfect and doesn't have anything odd or different with the texture; it's just slightly brown. My experience has been that if your rice is coming out solid on the bottom, you took the lid off while cooking - BIG no-no, once you hit the Cook button, don't remove the lid so you should have added and stirred everything before you press ""Cook.""Black and Decker claims it will keep rice warm basically forever. Don't you believe it - I can tell you that you should eat that rice within a half hour or so of completion (and for white rice, it cooks in about 20 minutes) because the steam vent will dry the rice out pretty quickly. But if served within fifteen minutes of completion it really is very good. Maybe not as good as the $100 steaming units (this is more of a parboiler than a true steamer) but for the price, amazingly good.Somebody mentioned that it should have a handle on the rice bowl. That may seem like a silly detail; but because the rice bowl is so small (very shallow) when you go to scoop the rice out the bowl will jump all over the place and there is no way to get a good, well, ""handle"" on it. That really is my only complaint, provided that it doesn't die on me like so many other people seem to indicate.12/29/13 update: still working perfectly. I have loaded it up to the maximum once or twice and it will indeed make enough rice for three or possibly four people, so it's not really as small as everyone says (however the rice cup only measures out for a two-person amount so there's a bit of guesswork involved). Here's a new tip: if you are adding anything that floats - herbs (mmm, cilantro...) or sesame oil - remove the lid and give it a quick stir just before it starts boiling. As I mentioned above, if you remove the lid while cooking you will definitely wind up with dry rice, but that seems to be an issue only once the rice has started boiling. Put that lid back on, though!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQIHAEE7ZJ2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CVTT52#wasThisHelpful","R1GQIHAEE7ZJ2H","A235FTJ4VL068Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235FTJ4VL068Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Returned a competing German-made spatzle maker, very similar size, quality, and price, because it did not disassemble. Why is that important? Try fitting one of these in a dishwasher and you'll see why.Makes amazingly good spatzle, very little effort, and an entire meal fits inside one scoopful.You will find it quite impossible to force the pin out in order to disassemble. The trick? Don't force it. The device should be in the fully closed position, but with no force applied to to the arms. The pin will pop right out!One very minor quibble, not worth a star but Amazon won't let me rate something as 4-1/2 stars: no hole or loop to hang it (and trust me, you will have trouble finding a drawer this will fit into).

"Incredible price compared to brick-and-mortar, especially the brand-name drug. Not time-released...and you're probably already aware that any guaifenesin is supposed to be taken with plenty of water, right? Well that goes quite literally double for these. Whether on an empty stomach or after a big meal, this large-dose, instant-release pill gives me a stomachache within 30 seconds of swallowing unless I down it with not just a glass but at least a full half-liter bottle of water, and even then it results in a slightly uneasy feeling.

"I just purchased the Hero 3+ Black Edition one month ago. When the Hero 4 came out I had to try it and I ended up returning my Hero 3+. Why did I get the Hero 4 Silver over the Hero 4 Black and the Hero 3+ Black?Three Reasons:1. The Hero 4 Black is $499 and does not come with an LCD (because of heat issues from 4k they could not put on an LCD).So really if you bought an LCD BacPac for the Black edition, it would cost you a total of $579 compared to the $399 of the Silver. This is a $180 difference!2. The two models BOTH have improved sharpness compared to the Hero3+ Black.This video compares the sharpness of the Hero3+ Black, to the Hero4 Silver, and the Hero4 Black:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Y2iTSNy8g&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgWatch this video to compare the Hero4 Black to the Hero3+ Black:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BacBT268-pQ&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgThen watch this video to compare the Hero4 Black to the Hero4 Silver:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNazYkq4omY&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2KtgAs you can see the sharpness between the Hero 4 Black and the Silver is the SAME. They both have the same upgraded sensor/lens and it's definitely improved over the 3+ Black. Yes, the 4 Black can do 4k at 30 FPS, 2.7k48, and 1080p120 while the 4 Silver can only do 2.7k at 30 FPS, 1080p60 (it can do 4k 15 FPS but that is not really usable for most purposes). But to be honest, that is the only improvement and it is a $180 difference! At this moment I cannot justify 4k for that much of an additional increase. I am happy with what the 4 Silver offers AND I get an LCD which is extremely convenient.3. Compare the battery life of the Hero 4 Black vs the Hero 4 Silver here:http://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-camera-battery-lifeAt 2.7k 30 FPS, the Black only lasts 1 hour and 10 minutes while the Silver lasts 1 hour and 50 minutes!! This is the SAME resolution. Why? Because the Black has a more powerful processor to handle the 4k, and this causes it to eat up more battery regardless of the frame rate.Given these three reasons, I do not believe the Hero 4 Black is worth the cost. But the Hero 4 Silver is definitely a bargain and worthy of an upgrade from the 3+ Black edition. Don't forget in addition to the cost, the Hero 4 Silver has identical specs as the Hero 4 Black (except for 4k 30 FPS). This means you will also get (compared to the 3+ Black):- Upgraded sensor with better ability to resolve detail- 2x the WiFi Speed (less lag and faster transfer speeds)- 2x the Dynamic Range for Audio Quality - watch this video comparing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXVPyTCr-E&list=UUTs-d2DgyuJVRICivxe2Ktg- Bluetooth Capability- Night Photo Mode (and ability to control shutter speed)- Night Time Lapse Mode (and ability to control shutter speed)- Protune for Photos- Auto white balance in Protune (enables higher bitrate while allowing for zero editing in post)- LCD TouchScreen (Silver only)All of these are the same upgrades on the Hero 4, so really you're trading $180 and the LCD screen on the Silver for 4k 30 FPS  and decreased battery life on the Black edition. Each person may have their own opinion but I think this is a big problem for most users because the cost does not justify the upgrade.I haven't had too much of a chance to test it out, but quick photos and videos showed it truly is sharper than the Hero 3+ Black edition. And given the video links I posted above, it is the same sharpness as the Hero 4 Black (unless you shoot in 4k of course). The touch screen is a GREAT addition and very responsive. It works like I would want it to so I am happy with that.Battery Life with LCDI also recently tested out the battery life with the LCD screen always on. The Hero 4 Silver comes with an auto-off of 1 minute and can be set at either 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or always on. The LCD brightness can also be set at high, medium, and low. My first test was with the LCD always on, brightness set to high, recording 2.7k 30 FPS. I was able to get 1 hour and 40 minutes out of the battery! That is pretty amazing as I did not expect that with the high brightness setting. I then did a test with the LCD off with the same frame rate and got 1 hour and 45 minutes (I did this 3 times with the same result).This means the LCD draws very little power (which is really really great)! For scuba diving, you will need the screen always on as you cannot activate it again once it turns off under water (unless you stop recording and record again but that can be annoying) and knowing it doesn't affect the battery significantly is a great plus. I also tested the Hero 3+ Black in 2.7k 30 and got 1 hour and 38 minutes so the battery life between the two cameras really is the same; even though the Hero4 is 20 mAH less it seems to give more battery life (1180 mAH in the Hero 3+ while 1160 in the Hero 4).Battery BacPacFor those curious I also tested the new Battery BacPac (claims 15% increased battery life) and compared it to the older Hero 3+ Battery BacPac. I used the Hero 4 Silver and recorded at 2.7k 30 FPS with LCD off. I got 2 hours and 57 minutes with new Battery BacPac compared with 2 hours and 27 minutes with the older Battery BacPac! So improvement of about 30 minutes is not bad at all! This is more than 15% (it was 35% with my test)! GoPro claims the Hero 4 Silver should get 3 hours with the Battery BacPac with 2.7k 30 FPS so I definitely would consider that result accurate.ConclusionOverall a great improvement and the recent firmware update released on the 14th of October has fixed all the minor bugs that were out there. I would highly recommend getting this especially if you are upgrading from an older model like the Hero 2 and Hero 3. If you have the money it is worth the upgrade from the Hero 3+ especially for the LCD, the improved sharpness, night time lapse modes, and audio improvements. I think the double wifi speed and bluetooth connectivity are bonuses but I wouldn't upgrade just for those reasons alone but if you combine all the other benefits it's definitely worth the upgrade!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6PTA3I8D17N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIYJF6U#wasThisHelpful","R1J6PTA3I8D17N","A2IGOHMKTRO6ID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IGOHMKTRO6ID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was expecting this to be a book of traditional math puzzles with some historical context. Instead, this is a book of puzzles, conundrums, mind games, and more, with some basis in math for sure, and some math history, but also plenty of psychology and mind-bending challenges, and even visual and illusion-type puzzles.The layout is more magazine than math book, with very active pages (unfortunately, as of now you can't peek inside on amazon). The author gives insights into his thinking process and why he puts in various challenges. It seems his goal is more to teach us how we think (and can improve) than teaching math itself. Yes, there are indeed historical math challenges included, but so much more so be prepared for plenty of diversions.I haven't gotten through even most of the book yet (it will take some time), but so far, as something of a math geek, I haven't found the math problems very challenging. To give you an idea, one puzzle that is marked as more challenging, goes something like this: Take a long telephone wire with a bunch of birds on it. Each bird is either looking to its right or left. How many birds are being watched by 0, 1 or both of its neighbors?The book can be very wordy (again, think magazine vs. math puzzle book), and even a bit strange at times. An early puzzle puts forth a scenario in which you are set up on a blind date with Julia Roberts, and you are supposed to figure out what is wrong. Unfortunately, the answer isn't ""because she is already married to Daniel Moder."" Maybe the author didn't realize that, or doesn't care, but either way that disturbed me - I mean, she's even got 3 children!There were also some puzzles that were missing key parts or were simply misleading. One puzzle says there are 2 daughters - one is married, one isn't (you don't know which), and one is always truthful and one always lies (you DO know which). You are supposed to figure out a 3-word question to ask either daughter that will tell you which is married (presumably because you want to marry the other one - never mind that she might be a compulsive liar). Obviously, you could simply ask the truthful daughter a question, but that is too simple - after reading the answer it seems you don't really know which is the truthful daughter after all.Some pictures were incorrect too, such as a cube dangling by a string that looked like Picasso drew it. The point is, the book needs more proofreading and polishing - but for a first edition, it could have been worse.In conclusion, this can be a fun book for junior high through college level readers, with a lot of variety, just be aware this isn't just math problems, and the math problems tend to require more problem solving skills than math knowledge. But it _will_ make you think, and provide new insights into how your mind solves a variety of problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUL26Y9HTZJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770854754#wasThisHelpful","RMUL26Y9HTZJ8","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This small, portable heater works great and heats up small rooms quickly. It cycles on and off to maintain the desired temperature. The included remote can be placed anywhere in the room and the heater will use the temperature at that location to cycle on and off. This is great - put the remote at the bedside and stay just the right temperature in bed. Using the remote is optional and the heater will function normally without it.The heater throws out a lot of heat without being uncomfortable nearby or even hot to the touch. The heat goes through plastic fins, so I was concerned about outgasing. There is a slight odor emitted, but it doesn't seem too bad and the plastic never really gets very hot.The cord stowage on the bottom is very convenient, and can store excess cord when in use. The cord length is a generous 6 feet in length with a grounded 3-prong plug.There is also a tip-over sensor on the bottom that shuts the unit off automatically if it is knocked over. So this unit seems really safe around children - not too hot and it won't set the rug on fire. As a side effect, the sensor can keep the unit from coming on when placed on a deeper pile carpet. But it is small and light and works fine on our table too.The unit does produce a slight click when cycling on or off, about as loud as a lamp switch, which can be annoying esp. since this heater seems to cycle a lot. Often it will turn on for only a few seconds at a time. It also has a timer that can turn the unit off after a few hours - perfect for warming up a room in the morning or as you are going to bed.The control buttons on the top of the unit are easy to use but don't light up for use in a dark room. The display and status LEDs can put out a lot of light though, esp. the green light when the remote is in use. We put a small cloth over it so we can sleep.Overall, this is a safe and convenient portable heater perfect for use in a nursery or child's room, or anywhere you need a little extra heat.PROSQuiet fanRemote temperature sensorTimer featureLight and portableTip-over sensorCord stowageCONSClicks when heat turns on and offCycles too oftenSlight odor when heat is onLights can be bright in bedroom","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CEVL2NE8LPDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PFY#wasThisHelpful","R2CEVL2NE8LPDK","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Celtic-style silver cross with garnet stone looks pretty much like the amazon picture, although the finish is highly reflective so its actual appearance depends on lighting. The grooves appear black oxidized which helps highlight the patterns. Overall it looks very nice and has a decent heft to it.The garnet is very red but can also show a brownish-pink hue when backlit. My chain measures 17.5"" and is also sterling silver - both the cross and chain are stamped 925. The chain is very lightweight and mine arrived tangled with one link broken, despite being messily taped to the back of the display card. It is nice that it is real sterling silver also, but treat it delicately.I would say the overall quality including detail of finish and stone cut is average, nothing extraordinary but fine for basic jewelry. The cross dimensions are 1 1/4"" tall by 13/16"" wide and seems durable (except for the delicate chain). It is made in China and comes in a nice blue and black amazon-style jewelry gift box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSMT4SNIW6KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028K3D6I#wasThisHelpful","R1YSMT4SNIW6KU","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted a self-winding watch, and love this style showing all the cool inner workings. The inner motion is constantly visible and you can see everything going on inside from the front and back. You can even see the winding mechanism working as you move it around.  It also just looks great being worn.  It is a large size and has some heft to it; my arms are not that wide at the wrists and this is about the biggest size watch that would work for me. The arms don't glow so there is no night visibility.It is entirely mechanical. I'm not sure how long it can go without winding, but I don't need to wind it when I wear it every day. The included manual is generic to all their watches and doesn't say anything about the self-winding mechanism.Unfortunately, there are a couple of serious drawbacks with this watch - the watch hands and band. The hour and minute hands are thin and reflective metallic blue. In most lighting conditions, they are very hard to see.  I can't simply glance at my watch to see the time; I usually have to tilt it around or move to get the lighting right to actually see the time.  With all the gears right behind the arms, they are basically camouflaged.The second hand (in a separate little dial in the bottom middle) has a white dot near the tip that helps, but the hour and minute hand just have a hole there. If the hands were larger or white (or at least had the white dots) they would show up much better. The blue is a cool color, but actually looks almost black much of the time and simply isn't functional.The band is an interesting design, with a metal clasp similar to all-metal bands, but mostly leather. Part of the clasp attaches to one of the holes in the band to adjust size. I thought this would be more convenient than a regular all-leather band, but it isn't working for me. First, the clasps pop open too easily, and even sometimes out of the hole when removing, defeating the purpose. There are two band retaining loops; one is fixed in place and whenever closing the clasp, one end of the watch band needs to be slipped into it but there isn't enough room so you have to really bend it. It's a pain and the band will probably wear out pretty soon from the bending. Finally, the large metal clasp also feels uncomfortable under the leather band. It's probably not worse than metal bands, but contrasts with the comfort of the leather.The watch band could be replaced, but the watch hand visibility issue is a huge caveat. Otherwise, the watch is attractive, fun, and well made. It comes in a very nice gift box too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA68DTKEZK8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXN9BQ#wasThisHelpful","RA68DTKEZK8Z4","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the more impressive toy lightsabers, but still has some shortcomings. This is the one made (and used) by Kylo Ren, a follower of the dark (evil) side in the new Star Wars movie ""The Force Awakens.""  Batteries are pre-installed so it works right out of the box (or even in the box in demo mode).  The main light saber and two side guards light up, but not the dagger, which can attach to the bottom of the handle for a cool 4-sided weapon.  (In promo pictures Kylo's version is 3-sided.)The saber can be swung to fully extend it, and it can be manually pressed back in to about 1/2 its full height.  Unfortunately it doesn't fully retract, but neither do most toy lightsabers.  The side guard blades and dagger stay their regular length.  The sound comes out of the bottom of the handle, where the non-lighting dagger can attach.  It is fairly easy and quick to twist the dagger on and off the saber, so it can be done as part of a play fight sequence.You can purchase other compatible sabers also and combine them to make all sorts of shaped weapons.The rumbling sound varies, making it seem like the saber is in motion, although the only feature triggered by motion is a short flashing and sound sequence when it strikes something in regular mode. The main problem I have with the sound is when holding the saber still, it continues to make the various sounds as if it is in motion; I'd prefer it to be relatively constant until it strikes something. Most users will probably like the varying sounds though.There are 2 switches, the on/off switch on one side and a button on the other. There switch has 3 positions: off, I/demo mode, and II/regular mode. In demo mode, the button starts a short 10 second sequence with a bunch of sounds and flashing and then it turns off until the button is pressed again.  In regular mode, the button turns the saber on and off and it reacts to striking things. However, the button doesn't turn it off if it is in a strike sequence, so you can't, for example, do a kill strike and then immediately turn it off.This would certainly be enjoyed by any young Jedis - wait, no, actually, make that dark side villians-in-training.  If you are looking for a cool light (good) side of the force weapon that's also in the Bladebuilders series check out the Star Wars Ezra Bridger Lightsaber Blaster. There are cheaper options too such as the Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Obi-Wan Kenobi Electronic Lightsaber.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37L2IAPGQ59T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZZVW#wasThisHelpful","R37L2IAPGQ59T5","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a super-strong trash can. The rubber is thick, flexible, and heavy, the sort that lasts and lasts. It is extra wide and only about 3"" taller than my typical 32 gallon trash cans.

These are commercial grade trash cans so often no lid is needed, such as when used inside a bear-proof metal container. Or with a Dome Top. Or in a prep kitchen. You get the idea.There are grips on the bottom for 2-handed dumping. The bottom also has anti-slip traction grooves. The bottom scuffs up pretty quickly but it doesn't affect functionality.Be warned that this trash container is HEAVY. Compared to typical residential-grade trash cans, this requires considerably more effort to lift even when empty. When full, it can weigh much more. If you don't need the superb durability, consider a residential trash can or one with wheels such as the Rubbermaid Commercial Brute Rollout Container, Square, Plastic, 50 Gallons, Gray (9W27GY).There are even deep, wide ""venting channels"" to prevent suction holding the bag in the can when you try to pull it out.

"This was a perfect fit in my 98 CRV LX AWD.  Quality seems excellent and it is working great so far.I do most of my own work on my Hondas and this took me about 4 hours including the thermostat and transmission fluid change.  Would probably take me 3 hours if I did it again.  I also replaced the upper and lower radiator hoses but not the transmission fluid hoses which are just regular smaller diameter hoses that connect to the bottom of the radiator.The radiator came with no extra hardware other than the nuts for mounting the 2 fans but all the old parts worked fine despite being 18 years old and a little rusty.

I was able to barely squeeze it in front of the A/C line above the radiator (with help).If replacing the thermostat also, take off the lower radiator hose, then take the 2 bolts off the housing the hose connected to.

"Put this in my 98 CRV LX AWD when I was replacing the radiator.  Had been noticing weird fluctuations in the dash temp gauge such as sudden drops and then climbing back up for a couple minutes followed by another drop during normal driving.  This one is 82C which is stamped right on it (about 180F) vs the OEM which is 78C (about 172F).  I know some people like to go to 195F but that's too high for my tastes.  I also liked that this one included the gasket at a reasonable price.It was fairly easy to replace once the upper radiator hose came off the housing. I had to use my heat gun for a minute to get the hose to slip off as it had been there almost 20 years. Just a couple bolts on the top right and lower left of the thermostat housing the hose disconnected from.  The bottom left bold is kind of hard to see and get to. I found my Craftsman 1/4"" drive with a regular socket just worked and I didn't need to use my universal joint extender. It's a tight spot so be careful not to drop the bolts.The included gasket fit fine, was maybe a little bigger than the original and I had to kind of work it into place to get it to stay in the right spot when re-bolting the housing.  At first I thought it was too big but it worked great.  Pin side goes up and slightly to the left.  Be sure the gasket is installed correctly on the thermostat before installing.So far it is working great. No leaks and no more gauge weirdness.

"This is a really nice watch! It looks bright and attractive, and feels comfortable to wear. With adjusting, the band will fit a large range of wrist sizes, and doesn't catch hairs like some watches do. The watch is marked for water resistance to 100 meters, which means that you can swim or snorkel (but not dive) while wearing the watch.There are three small dials on this watch. They are, from left to right, the stopwatch minute hand, the stopwatch second hand, and a 24-hour clock. The stopwatch is accurate and easy to use, although it can be difficult to see the dials when the hour or minute hand crosses over. The same goes for the 24-hour hand.I love the glow-in-the-dark feature of the watch. The hands glow a pleasing blue color in the dark, while during the day they look a normal white color. Sometimes, though, the glow is bright enough to see even in lit areas; during these times, the glow reminds me of Elvish swords. It looks pretty cool. All of the hands on the watch have this glow effect, except for the two second hands (stopwatch and regular).To remove the links and adjust the band, we used a link pin tool set, sold on Amazon. The task is pretty straight-forward: just hammer out the pins in the direction the arrows are pointing. They look a little like screws, but they aren't. When you hammer them back in, make sure it's the same side they came out.Overall, this is a high-quality, well-made timepiece. You won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIBL64TE5CH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQQN4FM#wasThisHelpful","R2HIBL64TE5CH4","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch looks much more impressive in person than in the amazon image. The watch body and hardware are a rich golden brass. It is also larger than I expected.  Not gigantic, but definitely very large. My wrists aren't very big for a guy, but it still fits. The watch body is almost as wide as my wrist. This watch would look impressive on any guy. I love it.The windows on the front and back (yes there is a crystal on the back too!) allow a great view of the constant motion of the intricate parts inside. You can actually look right through it, and with a lit background it's even more amazing. At first you might think it's just decoration but these gears are for real. You can actually see the winding and ticking inside.The band is a nice padded leather with a pattern imprinted on it. It has a large metal hybrid clasp that is a little tricky. Two sides (arms) of the clasp pop out and then you feed in the other side of the watch band. Once you've got the size right, it goes on and off much like a metal band clasp. It is stiff to open at first but breaks in quickly.I've been really wanting a wind-up watch; I guess I miss the ones I had when I was younger, and like that this is ""off the grid"" with no batteries! And it has a beautiful ticking sound against my ear. The second hand races around at about 4 ticks per second. The hands glow a light green for viewing in the dark, including a dot at the tip of the second hand.The only negative is the included manual is general and geared more towards their battery watches. So far winding lasts at least a day - I haven't let it go longer than that yet. I'll update this review as I learn more. The warranty is for 5 years with a $15 fee for a covered repair or exchange.I would love to get a watch like this as a gift. It is an impressive and quality watch, evident as soon as you open the box. Even the case is really nice and helps make this a special gift, whether from someone else or just for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYLO4ZUYTFKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXMWZK#wasThisHelpful","R1UYLO4ZUYTFKR","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun puzzle for kids around 8 and up. The pieces are made of a hard colored plastic material, so they won't develop frayed edges the way 2-dimensional puzzles do. The pieces are numbered, so that the solver can easily figure out where they go; without the numbers, it is quite challenging to find the correct arrangement, because of the repeating striped pattern.At the top of the puzzle, there's a larger piece with a picture on it. The picture is actually a printed sticker, which the solver must stick onto a plastic unit. It's best to have an adult do this; when my kids assembled the puzzle, they stuck the sticker on wrong, and it had to be removed and restuck.When completed, it makes a nice decoration. We put it on our mantel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17H71U8MWAIXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O0TOJK#wasThisHelpful","R17H71U8MWAIXR","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch was designed to be massive. Its size makes it rather special. I don't have very large wrists, so when it arrived, my first thought was that it seemed unusable because of its size. However, after looking at it for a while, I realized that it would be perfect for a man with a high muscle mass and large arms.Actually, it would also be good for a man who desires a higher muscle mass, because the watch weighs more than half a pound and will probably strengthen the arm you wear it on. It isn't heavy enough to weigh me down, though - I can comfortably play a piano while wearing the watch, and it doesn't have any noticeable effects.At first, the band was way to big for me, so I had to adjust it. Six of the links on the band are removable (you need a very small screwdriver, like the ones used for most eyeglasses); with these links removed, the watch can fit a wide range of wrist sizes. I only needed to remove five of the links to make the band the right size for me. The clasp also has a spring bar adjustment for fine-tuning the band size (you may need a spring bar remover for that). This does not void the warranty, as far as I can tell.The watch is marked for water resistance to 100 meters. This doesn't actually mean it can go 100 meters below the surface; it just means it can withstand water for swimming or snorkeling. According to the instruction manual, if you don't need a helium-oxygen mixture, you're good.The watch also has a rotating bezel that can be aligned with the minute hand for measuring elapsed time. Oddly, the bezel only rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. This seems backwards to me. Also, if I rotate a little too far, I have to rotate the bezel all the way around again.I'm finding two problems with the watch. First, it's really thick, and sticks out so far that it tends to bump into things. I already have a small gouge on the bezel which is too soft to stand up to small impacts - I don't even remember it hitting anything. The rubber guard around the edge doesn't help for this, because most impacts are going to come from the top... not the sides, because that is where your arm will be. Second, the minute hand is slightly loose - it wobbles back and forth by about 1/3 of a minute. It doesn't affect me too much, but for a watch of this type, I would expect higher quality.But if you want a huge watch that will get noticed, this is it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LIL7GWYOUE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N16RY6#wasThisHelpful","R19LIL7GWYOUE4","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSSnug, flexible fit with 6 different types of ear tipsExceptional clarityLong lasting batteryIntuitiveBlock external noiseCONSExpensiveCan be uncomfortable when fully insertedI was impressed by the clarity of these ear buds compared to other decent mid-level ear buds. These must be properly inserted for great sound.  If the bass seems weak, they aren't all the way in, so try again. Max volume is decent but not ear breaking as with many wired ear buds, which is fine by me. My teens reported a very slight added buzz on some songs such as Brave by Sara Bareilles, but I am not sure if that's the headphones or the phone.The medium silicone ear tips fit snugly in my ears and block out most external noise. It's really easy to swap out the ear tips and you can choose between S/M/L flexible silicone or molding foam. These do NOT have noise cancelling as some seem to think, but you don't really need that with these as they fit so tight you really can't hear much (could be dangerous actually). The ear fins didn't do it for me with my ear shape, but these stay in great with just the ear tips. They do get a little uncomfortable over time because they are so tight, but the smaller ear tips won't stay in for me.The cord is tacky/grabby and can stick to my neck, which is fine most of the time but occasionally will pull out one ear tip when I turn my head if the cord is resting on my neck. Also the cord is pretty thick and can transmit sound if it rubs on your shirt. Use the included cable clips to help prevent these issues (see manual).Easy to sync with a Bluetooth device (V 2.1 which is perfectly fine for headphones). The 3-button controls make sense but it helps to look at the online manual; e.g. hold the volume up or down for forward/back. Works great with my android phone and handles calls like it should. I liked the case; it seals well (might even be waterproof) and holds everything. It's a little big but is well made and is easy to open/close once you know how.The battery does last for many hours (they say 8) and charges only take up to two hours.  Overall decent little high-quality wireless earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YE5N1T98PM8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HSW4SM#wasThisHelpful","R1YE5N1T98PM8T","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS: Bright, sturdy, sleek; USB charging ports and built-in wrench.CONS: Cant twist to adjust the light direction; imposing power supply and cord.This lamp is very sturdy and produces an even, bright white light, which is shaded on the sides so it doesn't shine in your eyes. The black finish is glossy black, and I can even see my face reflected in it (you can't tell from the picture). The button (next to the handle at the tip) requires only a light touch. In fact, I don't even need to touch the button - if I move my finger close enough to it, the light turns on. I think there's some sort of electric field involved. There are three brightness settings which can be picked by holding the power button.The double-hinge allows for 360-degree positioning. The other hinge has a range of about 110 degrees. No matter where you position the light, the base is stable, and will not fall over. It can be quickly adjusted by hand, and the tension of the hinges can be adjusted at any time using an included Allen wrench, stored in the underside of the base.The base also has 4 large rubber pads to hold it firmly in place on the desk.  The USB charge ports in the base are nice and are used for changing devices, not the lamp; the lamp must always be plugged in.  The base measures 8 x 6 x 1.The lamp comes completely ready to use, no installation/assembly required.  It is not actually a Black& Decker design, but is made in Taiwan by Amax Incorporated under license from Black & Decker.If this lamp were $50 cheaper, I would recommend it. However, for the price, I would expect more. For example, the lamp does not swivel or rotate in any of the joints, so you can't swivel the light back towards the wall, for example. The wall adapter sticks out about 2"" from the wall, causing problems if the outlet is behind a dresser. A built-in rechargeable battery would solve this problem, but this unit does not have that. Finally, the cord plugs into the back of the lower arm; I'd rather it plugged into the base where it would be less conspicuous.Overall, this is a decent, sturdy and bright but pricey lamp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BP1F2GUP22PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW76VW#wasThisHelpful","R1BP1F2GUP22PX","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sturdy, well-made set is easy to assemble and provides interactive play. It is ideal for 4 to 6 year olds, and older siblings will want to help too!  Besides assembly and re-building, the fire arch and turnstile require constant attention as the train races around the track. The plastic is high quality and has some flexibility to it so the pieces should hold up well.My 12 year old assembled the whole set by herself in about 10 minutes with only one minor difficulty she quickly figured out - the fire arch required a little push on the railing of the track to get everything in place, which is nothing a small child couldn't do once shown. The engine requires 2 AAA batteries (not included); just unscrew with a small Phillips screwdriver and the door slides right off. It is easy to close also - insert the little tab in place and just screw it back on. Other than that, no tools are needed. There is a little lever on top of the engine to turn it on and make it go. You have to pick up the engine to do this as the lever is rather small.This is a FAST little engine, and even I had trouble keeping up with it. It is 4-wheel drive with rubber-coated wheels so it has excellent traction and can handle steep inclines. However, it still has trouble trying to get up the steep yellow ramp and often needs a little push - it has plenty of power, just not quite enough traction for such a steep ramp. The children don't mind; in fact they like to help keep the train on track and zooming around.The other minor issue is the engine often arrives at the turnstile before it has been oriented in the correct direction, hitting the rail and usually waiting there, pushing until it is turned to allow the engine through. But the engine has so much power, it sometimes ends up turning itself off the track and heading off across the room, requiring someone to chase it down.But these are minor issues and having such a peppy little engine is worth the effort.  Additional sets such as the Chuggington StackTrack Drop and Load Dash Set add to the creative ways to assemble and use the tracks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VX6FCG5IJI7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV0SUIO#wasThisHelpful","R1VX6FCG5IJI7Y","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author has a very simple 6-part (not really step) approach to investing ""safely"". If I were to summarize his approach, it is this: play it safe, pay off your house first, don't do anything stupid, and don't take any chances.This means no stocks or bonds. Instead, he advocates buying a home and paying it off first, then put any more cash into government guaranteed assets in an RRSP (for Canadians). This supposedly ensures guaranteed interest and no loss of funds.While I appreciate his simple, no-nonsense approach and that he is willing to take on conventional wisdom regarding investments, I have some concerns about his approach.One issue is that stocks tend to do really well long-term. Taking the slow, steady approach with a small but sure interest has done far worse in the long term. The author seems extremely risk-adverse, which may or may not match your risk tolerance.On the other hand, if you share his fear of the market, note that his approach also won't preserve the real value of your money during periods of high inflation when interest rates don't keep up. I believe there are safer approaches to preserving wealth than his.Third, if you are of moderate means and follow his advice, you will have almost no investments other than your home. I'm not totally opposed to that approach, but it's basically putting all your hopes on the real estate market. In a downturn, you could fare very poorly. To me, that's risky.Further, the value of a mortgage can rise dramatically when interest rates go up, and one may be able to get a better return in other investments. Again, it boils down to your view of the world economy and tolerance to risk.I was disappointed in the lack of in-depth analysis in this book and very little presentation of other viewpoints, although that does match his ideology of keeping things simple. Many of the charts appear to be from the previous edition; I would have liked some more recent data. He does expose some of the downsides of conventional investing, but doesn't really consider other options or give any advice to those willing to take on some investment risk.For other views that are also contrary to the conventional stocks & bonds advice, read The Aftershock Investor: A Crash Course in Staying Afloat in a Sinking Economy and The Real Crash: America's Coming Bankruptcy - How to Save Yourself and Your Country.For a Canadian who wants to play it extremely safe, and isn't worried about inflation, his is a simple and reasonable approach. But I don't have confidence in the value of our fiat currencies long-term, and am willing to take on some risk in the hopes of greater returns on my investments. I suggest reading other books for a much more thorough analysis of investment options and then decide what is right for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAT6FEVUOQBGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118994175#wasThisHelpful","RAT6FEVUOQBGU","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very readable analysis of why our economy is in big trouble and what could happen in the near future.  The authors give advice on how to prepare if their predictions come true.I found this book informative and intriguing if a bit simplistic.  There are so many factors and possibilities of ways things could unravel that weren't individually considered, that I am left wondering about alternate possibilities to the authors' prediction.They also don't go into the phases yet to come in the detail I would have liked to see.  In the end, the message just seems to be: retreat to gold before it's too late!Still, the overall message of being prepared for the inevitable collapse of our economy under the weight of our tremendous debt is an important one, and the authors provide important insights into the state of our economy and the magnitude of the necessary correction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJUBZ4QFY4WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118073541#wasThisHelpful","R1VJUBZ4QFY4WX","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This TV is very light and extremely easy to set up. The foot design is surprisingly stable, so there's very little danger that this thing will get knocked over. Overall, it seems like a very high-quality product. I only had one issue: when I slid the TV across my dresser, one of the rubber pads came off and disappeared. I contacted Samsung, and they sent me a new set of feet at no cost.When placed on a flat surface (like a dresser), the feet lift the TV by about 1.5"", which is plenty of room for most blu-ray players to fit underneath. You can also mount it on your wall, but you'll need to buy a wall mounting kit (not included).The sound quality is pretty good for a TV, and at 50% volume it's loud enough for my needs.The TV comes with Amazon Instant Video pre-installed, and the TV also has built-in WiFi which is fast enough to stream HD video without any lag. It also comes with YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix, so you can watch stuff from those sites as well. The TV can also download new apps from the internet, if there's something you need that isn't already preinstalled on the TV. This is all easily accessible using the remote.The TV only takes a couple of seconds to turn on, so I can start watching movies from my blu-ray player right away. However, there's one slight annoyance: it takes a full minute before SmartHub is ready and the contained apps are ready to use. So if you want to watch something from Amazon Instant Video, you have to wait for another minute after powering on.On the back, the TV has the following ports:* Component audio/video in (several ports)* two HDMI in ports* ANT (TV) in* USB 3.0* LAN (Local Area Network)* Digital optical audio outI've only needed to use the HDMI port, but the audio out will be useful if I ever want to upgrade to a high quality speaker system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWV3QLJQXU9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9U8RZQ#wasThisHelpful","RGWV3QLJQXU9X","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is rare that I find a new childrens book of this caliber! My teens loved it, girls and boys both, and I could barely put it down myself.This inspirational story featured a truly virtuous protagonist, a knight-to-be on a critical but mysterious mission in a Middle Ages setting full of knights, barons, monks, robbers and peasants - many varied, and interesting characters of all sorts brought to life in a masterful way. The kingdoms portrayed in the book are fascinating and realistic, brought to life in richly described settings.The story is suspenseful and engaging, even reminiscent of The Hobbit, one of my favorite books, but no dragons or wizards, but rather a more realistic and fascinating world full of perils and surprises.I am surprised that a work of this quality and magnitude has taken so long to translate into English. And the translation is quite good, reading smoothly and naturally. The language is fine English, very appropriate for the story and a great pleasure to read.This is surely destined to be a classic work in English as it was in the original Dutch. It is long at about 500 pages but not too hard to read (though I had to look up crenellated).

"This humidifier uses ultrasound to vaporize the water into a cool mist. The main advantage to a ""cool mist"" humidifier is that it begins producing mist as soon as it's turned on. Some people prefer to use steam humidifiers, however, because they boil and sterilize the water, and don't eject live mold or bacteria into the air. This humidifier does not boil the water at all; if you use the warm mist setting instead of the cool mist setting, all it does is warm the water to about 80 degrees before it vaporizes it (which actually makes it easier for bacteria to thrive). If the humidifier is maintained well and cleaned periodically, this shouldn't be a problem, but I wouldn't recommend sticking your face into the mist and inhaling deeply.Regarding the warm-mist setting, it speeds up the humidification of the room. Because it heats the water to only 80 degrees before it vaporizes it, I can't imagine it would be very effective if the water starts out warm (especially during the summer), but in cold temperatures I could understand how it might help. (The mist itself feels almost the same whether you're using warm or cold mist.)I like the other features. One is variable mist output - I can adjust the amount of mist that comes out. On the fastest mist setting, running constantly, a full 2-gallon water tank lasts a little under 2 days (~43 hours, actually). You can make it even faster by removing the attachments. I haven't tried the lowest mist setting for extended periods of time, but based on the level of mist coming out, I bet it would last the full 120 hours as advertised.Probably the most useful feature is the desired humidity level; you can set the humidity anywhere from 40% to 75% (in 5% increments), or you can tell the humidifier to run constantly. There's also an optional timer, so I can tell the humidifier to turn off automatically after a period of time. The room's current humidity is displayed on the screen.When ""auto"" is enabled, the humidifier automatically uses warm mist, keeps the nightlight on, and sets the desired humidity to 50%. Kind of pointless, because those are all features that I can easily set myself.I really like the vertical extension. It's basically a pipe which takes the mist about 4 feet above the ground before releasing it into the air. This allows for more even humidification, because the mist is heavier than air and sinks downward. There's also another attachment which goes on the end of the tube, and can be used to direct the mist. I prefer not to use it, because it restricts the airflow, so a lot of the mist collects on the inside and runs back down into the humidifier. This slows down the humidification process.The thing I find most annoying about the humidifier is that it has a bright blue display that won't turn off. If I'm running it in my bedroom at night, I have to cover the display with some cardboard so it won't keep me up. The display is bright enough to illuminate objects in my room. It wouldn't be so bad if they used green or red light, but blue is the specific color that prevents sleep. I hate to think how bright the nightlight would be, but thankfully that can be turned off.Another problem I noticed is that the water in the vaporization area gets a slight off-odor if it sits for a couple days without running it. The obvious solution here is to pour out the water when it isn't being used, but now I wonder whether the inside of the tank is the only part of the unit with antibacterial properties.So to summarize, it's a pretty cool humidifier (pun intended), and has a lot of useful features, but it does have minor issues.Pros:+ Very quiet (regardless of the settings).+ Adjustable mist output. Nozzles can be removed if necessary, so the mist will come out faster.+ Large 2-gallon tank lasts almost 2 days when running at highest setting, 5 days at lowest setting.+ The humidifier maintains a specific humidity, or can be told to run continuously.+ Comes with a vertical extension, which brings the mist 4 feet up into the air.+ Cool mist will slightly cool the room in Summer.+ Unit without water is very light, making storage easy.+ Has an optional built-in nightlight.Cons:- The bright blue display cannot be turned off at night.- Only the tank seems to have antibacterial properties; the other parts of the humidifier are unprotected.- Uses ultrasound, so water is not sterilized. If tap water is used, minerals are released into the air.- The buttons respond to a very light touch, and can be activated when accidentally brushed against.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3LATUI38MK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD7RSG#wasThisHelpful","R1M3LATUI38MK0","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well-made pack is best suited for overnight or weekend backpacking trips, or possibly longer.  It is fine for all-day hikes as well, especially for those who tend to carry more.  The color is sort of muted teal, not quite as bright as the amazon pictures.  We have had good experiences with Kelty backpacks as far as utility, durability and comfort and this one is no exception.This backpack will fit the vast majority of women as it has a generous torso range of 14.5"" to 18.5"".  The shoulder straps slide up or down to ensure a correct position with the pack resting on the hips.  There are 2 coated aluminum strips running the height of the pack behind the shoulder and waist pads for enough rigidity to keep the pack from slouching.  For shorter women, the top of the pack will rise nicely above the shoulders.  It has just the right amount of padding for the back and hips.The main pack has a cinch closure on top with a rain flap.  It also has a side zipper midway up for secondary access into the main pack.  There are a few smaller pouches on the back and top (on the rain flap) as well as 2 small pockets on the waist belt.  There are 2 side mesh pockets that can we used for water bottles, though I didn't see anywhere special for a water system or corded MP3 player as you might find in a day pack.The pack is fully adjustable with straps everywhere.  It can expand or contract to fit a variety of load sizes using straps to keep the weight center closer to the body.  There are 2 loops on the lower back and some sewn straps on the bottom for external attachments, as well as a large hanging loop.  The fabric is durable nylon and there is mesh inside the waist belt and midback for breathability.This should (roughly) fit most women from about 5'4"" to about 5'11"" with an average torso to height ratio.  If you are in the middle of that you will be fine with this pack.  Otherwise, to ensure a good fit, measure your torso from the bony protrusion on the back of the neck (tilt your head forward) to the top of the hips.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D1CR2YCNHQ4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCF2F8#wasThisHelpful","R3D1CR2YCNHQ4F","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is an enjoyable read touching on many aspects of evaluating character and abilities in others, with plenty of anecdotes and a measure of humor thrown in.  The book covers how to evaluate, choose, attract and retain great leaders and team members for any type of organization.  It also talks about how to be a great leader and improve one's skills and effectiveness, building a positive culture, choosing values, and handling legal issues.  It even provides guidance on how to pick a new leader for an organization.Rather than provide a step-by-step guide to making leadership decisions, the author aims to change your thinking and processes for making decisions and handling a variety of milestones in running an organization or team.  Some of my favorite parts of the book challenge conventional thinking about topics such as compensation, what makes effective workers, or even how to analytically choose a spouse!One chapter that particularly impressed me included one on working with team members and the importance of alternate, even opposing, viewpoints in an effective team.  I tend to gravitate towards like-minded individuals, and have to make a conscious effort to include and value others with different mindsets.He does make one claim I remain skeptical about: `You don't need to go out looking for geniuses since, for most jobs, there is a ""threshold level"" IQ needed, and anything above it has almost no impact on performance.' (p.87)  However, I do appreciate his insights into seeing the many facets of individuals, and the great importance of potential, ""our ability to grow and adapt to fundamentally different and increasingly complex responsibilities.... [including] keen insight that allows them to see connections where others don't.""  These, I think, are part of IQ.Overall, I believe his wealth of experience and well-founded guidance will prove valuable to anyone involved in management or hiring decisions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUEG7K6H9WZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625271522#wasThisHelpful","R2KUEG7K6H9WZW","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really cool toy for boys ages 7 to 10, although other ages and many girls will most likely find it interesting as well. Various lion growls and roars are automatically activated when certain features on the Lion's Den castle are used; according to my 10-year-old son, this makes the toy seem like a lot more fun. But if the sound becomes too annoying, it can be disabled with the flick of a switch.Included are a toy king, a soldier, two suits of armor, two shields, two double-sided axes, a king outfit, a throne, a toy lion, and a green villain.  The Lion's Den castle itself is large - about 2 feet across and 16"" high.The castle also comes with a disk launcher, which is actually strong enough to activate special features on the castle. It surprised me how well it worked, as similar features in other products tend to be cheap gimmicks.  Not so with Imaginext - I've found several of their products we own to be consistently well made and durable.Features that can be activated by the shooting disks include: a tower that will collapse when hit; a secret exit from the dungeon that opens; and a flag that will terminate ""defense mode"" when hit by the disk launcher.The other features of the castle include ""defense mode,"" which means that the doors and openings are secured; a trap door which drops the enemy into a dungeon; a door that opens to release a toy lion; and a moving paw which grabs enemy pieces and pulls them into a dungeon. My kids particularly enjoyed the moving paw; the mechanism works nicely, and it's fun to see the bad guys being snatched by a castle.The Lion's Den has proven substantial enough to provide many hours of playtime for my boys, and can be added to with other Imaginext products in the same ""Castle"" line, such as the Castle Serpent Vehicle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTWXOTGORT6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J49UTYU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTWXOTGORT6U","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need licorice for an adrenal boost.

It is an aquired taste: naturally, mildly sweet with a strong bitter flavor similar to something like coffee.  Awesome little box to stick in my purse!I suck on two little pellets after breakfast and again after lunch to get my required dose.

"Update 5/5/2015:Even after the latest updates, this unit is still the worst Garmin I've ever owned.  They seem to have slightly corrected the time to destination calculation, but it still overestimates.  But the horrendous traffic reporting still has the major flaws: re-routing you onto overcrowded back streets without telling you what the delay on the main route is, and still no ""traffic search"" feature to show traffic delays on nearby roads.When you hit serious traffic, you're on your own.Update 11/26/2014  Traffic reporting is totally worthless when you need it most!During some recent pre-Thanksgiving traffic, I came to realize more than ever how horrendous the traffic feature is on this GPS unit.  Coming home from work on the Friday before Thanksgiving week in heavy traffic, the GPS wanted me to get off the freeway and onto a main road with traffic lights.  I knew that the alternate road was often jammed also.  So I wanted to know how long the delay on the freeway was to make an educated decision.But this GPS won't tell you!  There is no way to see nearby traffic.  It only shows the traffic on the route it has chosen (and sometimes on one alternate route if you know how to check that).  And since the alternate road wasn't a freeway, the GPS thought it had NO traffic.  I took the exit anyway (I'll explain later), and sure enough, the road was DEADLOCKED.  Fortunately, it was the same exit as a friends house - in the other direction, and as the Garmin was giving me NO indication of how long the backup on the freeway was, I went there for the next few hours and watched the traffic online (since the Garmin was pretty much useless).On my older Garmins, I can simply hit the traffic icon on the main screen, select ""Traffic Search"" and see ALL the nearby traffic sorted by distance away.  Then I can select any of the roads listed and see all the delays on that road.  But no more!  This 2597LMT will only show the delays on its chosen route.  There is a hard to find menu option to show ""Incidents"" which has only ever shown construction.So when it really counts, this GPS is a total let down in terms of traffic reporting.  Garmin, please FIX this major issue!  If anyone knows a work-around, PLEASE reply to this review and I'll update it.  I called Garmin and they said the traffic search feature had been removed from newer Garmins.Original Review:I have several Garmins and have had this one for about 7 months now and am very disappointed.It is missing a lot of features my older Garmins have, such as viewing local traffic by radius - now it only shows traffic on the current route so it is impossible to know other traffic in the area, except looking at the hard-to-see colors on the overhead map, which DON'T show the delay times.  I would use this often, so if traffic to one store is terrible, I might want to see what the total traffic picture is in the area to decide whether to choose my own route or simply go to a different store, etc.  Can't do this anymore.There are some improvements to routing, so it will SOMETIMES find better routes automatically, but often still won't find the best route, esp. if traffic is involved and despite the fact that it KNOWS the delay times.  Again, since this model won't show me the traffic on nearby roads, I can't decide whether to take an alternate route that I know about.  There's no way to force it to show all the multiple routes to a destination so I can pick one myself based on my knowledge of those roads.The automatic rerouting sometimes inexplicably doesn't do anything, even if an alternate route is 15+ minutes faster.  When I suspect this is the case, I will cancel the current route entirely and start over, and then finally it shows the better route.  There seems to be an overall very poor traffic handling with this unit, as if traffic were an afterthought and isn't very well integrated or even fully functional.Also the voice commands is cool but very limited in what you can do; for many common things you have to go back to the touch screen. For example, there are no traffic voice commands.It also totally overestimates time to destination.  The older Garmins assume there are no such things as red lights, and you always go the speed limit no matter what (around turns, etc).  They overcorrected on this model by arbitrarily adding about 40% to the commute time.  For example, it might say 44 minutes for a 28 minute trip for no apparent reason, whereas the older Garmins might have said 24 minutes.  If I didn't know better, I might just give up and go home instead of making it to my movie with time to spare.Finally, the cord isn't durable.  My first one lasted about 6 months with careful use before shorting out.  (Garmin did send a new one with little hassle.)  Every trip I carefully put it in my glove compartment to avoid being stolen (no yanking of the cord).  And the cord is very stiff in colder weather, which can be annoying depending on where you mount it.  And after a couple of months the suction cup keeps falling off the windshield - I've been meaning to try putting Armor All on it but haven't gotten around to it yet.Many newer navigation systems will learn your routes.  Despite the fact that I take the same route out of my community every day, it still keeps trying to take me on slower roads through the neighborhood where I'd also have to take a left at a stop sign onto a busy road instead of the main route out that everyone takes.  It doesn't seem to realize which the main roads in the community are, which wouldn't be so bad if it could eventually learn that I always go a different way and use that route instead.So while the older Garmins were good for their time (except for underestimating travel times), this unit really needs a major redesign to make full and proper use of the features.On the plus side, there's enough memory in it now to upgrade the included North America maps including USA and Canada without having to add a memory card.While this unit is certainly useable and probably really deserves 3 stars, but because it is so poorly programmed and so inferior to older models, I am only giving it 1 star.  If they fix the firmware I will update my review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGHI0BK1KN1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0I88#wasThisHelpful","R3UGHI0BK1KN1X","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this mattress.  I usually spend several days finding just the right mattress and this is one of the best I've slept on.  Softer mattresses, and especially older ones that sag in the middle, really bother my lower back.This Dreamax DM-230Q provides great support plus a soft, comfortable feel.  I actually fall asleep faster on this mattress than our higher-end Simmons!  I usually go to sleep on my side or stomach and wake up on my back.  On this mattress, I can sleep on my back, side or stomach and feel very comfortable.  This is a sturdy, heavy mattress; I'd rate it mid-level overall; not light like cheaper bunk-bed mattresses and not super-sized like some of the $1000 ones.The mattress arrives in a surprisingly small but heavy box.  The mattress is compressed to about a 3"" thickness and rolled top-to-bottom into a long box.  It took two of us to carry the queen size and put it on our platform bed.  No boxspring is needed with this mattress!  Keep in mind also that it is heavy, and there are no handles or straps built into the mattress to help move it in the future.No need to worry about the mattress being compressed in shipping - most spring sets are shipped to the manufacturers compressed anyway, and the springs can handle that just fine.Once decompressed, our mattress measures about 10"" thick; 7.5"" for the spring box and 2.5"" for the pillowtop.  The fabric is very nice and sturdy quality, and the top feels soft and luxurious.  There was only a little ""new mattress"" smell, and after a few days is almost gone.  I am sensitive to chemical smells (and had to return a mattress once due to the odor causing sinus problems) but the slight lingering odor in this mattress is very mild and actually pleasant.The mattress has 13.5 gauge coils with a 312 count innerspring, which is on the firmer side by the numbers.  To me it feels like a medium-soft mattress; medium firmness underneath that feels softer due to the pillowtop.I've tried memory foam but found that as those mold to my body I'd sink in and my back would hurt; plus, when I moved they would take too long to re-form to my body.  I also prefer the feel of an innerspring mattress.  I get both great comfort and the support I need with this mattress.The only issue I am having is that it sags too much when I sit on the edge of the bed.  This most bothersome in the morning when I drowsily swing myself into a sitting position and it feels like I am sliding onto the floor.  This may bother anyone over my weight of 170lbs or so.  Most higher-end mattresses have extra support (usually foam) all around the sides to prevent this, but perhaps that would make it harder to ship compressed.  The corners do have extra support.The mattress can be flipped top-to-bottom (but not upside down) for more even wear over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGBH8DWKHNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYBR1JO#wasThisHelpful","RXGBH8DWKHNY","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What sets this headset apart is the very long battery life combined with the amazing sound.  I know of no other headset that will give you such great sound and 15 hours of use between charges.  I listened to everything from classical to rock and watched videos with dialog.  They all sounded wonderful, although I did want a little more bass.  I would describe the sound as crisp, clear, and natural.  One can install the Samsung Level app (if you have Android 4.2.2 or later) or a bass boosting app to help personalize the sound.Yes, there are headphones with better sound.  What Samsung did with these is give maximum sound quality balanced with long-lasting battery life.  And they did that amazingly well.Included in the box are the headphones, a nice semi-flexible card case, an audio cable with multi-function buttons and MIC, airplane adaptor, data link cable (USB to micro-USB), and manual.  The headphones have a small on/off switch, a button for Bluetooth sync and turning on/off noise cancelling, mic for talking, and 2 front mics for noise cancelling.  There's an extra mic on the back of the right ear cup and Samsung says there is a fourth hidden inside an ear cup to help with noise cancellation also.The noise cancellation works remarkably well, and the ear pads alone provide privacy so people right next to me can't hear what I'm listening to.  Though I haven't tried these on a plane yet, when planes are going over my house, I can hear a low-pitched rumble until I press the ANC button to turn on the cancellation - then the annoying rumble disappears completely and I only hear a much less annoying light white noise.  There are mics on the front of the headphones for cancellation; if you touch them you get noise through the noise cancellation system.  This is a quick way to verify it is turned on.  It works best on humming/rumbling noises, targeting the sounds that most interfere with your listening experience.  Note that it only works on external sound, so it won't cancel noises in your head; you'll have to look elsewhere for help with that.It is easy to register the headphones with a Bluetooth device such as a smartphone or tablet using the ANC button or NFC.  I am using it mostly with my Samsung Galaxy S Blaze Android phone.  Unlike my Logitech Z600 speakers, I wasn't able to connect these headphones to multiple devices simultaneously (probably a good thing considering the intended use).  You can also use the included audio cable, which has volume controls and a multi-function button for answering calls and the like, and the included airplane adapter allows these to be used with the L/R jacks on older planes.I found the fit and comfort great for headphones of this size.  They weigh 350g, or about the weight of 2 cell phones.  The cushioned adjustable headband rests comfortably on the top of my head holding the ear cups nicely in place.  While the ear cups don't swivel, they are also cushioned for better fit.  I wear wire-rimmed glasses and they fit over them fine.  They are a bit cumbersome in bed due to their size - I have to tilt the top forward a little lying back on my pillow.  These Samsung Level In ear buds would be much better for use in bed, or possibly the Samsung Level On, the other headphones in their lineup.  Samsung also offers a Samsung Level Box bluetooth speaker.The right ear cup is a touchpad that allows volume adjustments and track fwd/rev, as well as multi-function tapping to answer calls or turn on S Voice for voice commands to the connected device.  The volume increases gradually but will reduce quickly, which is useful when someone starts talking to you or music starts up too loudly.I found that with my phone at least, using Bluetooth I needed to adjust volume on both the phone and the headset - they are separate but both affect the actual volume.  At first I didn't realize this and wondered why the sound wasn't very loud.  With the cable, however, the volume is only adjusted through the device or buttons on the cable - the touchpad does nothing.  In fact, the headphones work with the audio cable whether the they are switched on or off.The Samsung Level app only works with Anrdroid 4.2.2 or later (newer Jelly Bean, KitKat); if you can't find it in Google Play, just google search for it on the device.  While useful and cool, it isn't necessary to use the headphones.  As of today the manual isn't available online, so don't lose it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NS2OPOQFZJHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGGK71A#wasThisHelpful","R1NS2OPOQFZJHT","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It would seem the smell issue I and a few other reviewers reported has been resolved.Original review:Every one of these tissues that I tried (from several boxes) had a strange disgusting chemical pesticide-like smell.  I called Kleenex and was told the tissues shouldn't have a smell and they would send coupons to replace the product.  But they only sent me two $1 coupons to replace 8 boxes of tissues!Now I see several other reviewers complaining of a weird odor, including someone who purchased them elsewhere.I did not notice any tissue fibers coming off these tissues like some reviewers reported.  Maybe they fixed that?  They do seem slightly less absorbent than regular tissues, but that wasn't an issue for us.  However, we aren't using them anymore because of the headache-inducing smell.Regular Kleenex are fine, no smell at all.  I also like the cheaper Angel Soft Facial Tissue, 12 Count or 18 Count, which have no bad odors, but aren't quite as strong as Kleenex.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V9EUSG1O24VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YD8232#wasThisHelpful","R1V9EUSG1O24VN","A3IMK08UX0I46A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMK08UX0I46A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For cupboards, it turns out I like contact paper better because I can wipe a sponge and clean, instead of removing and washing cloth. While I appreciate the fact that I can slide objects across the surface without impediment, again, regular contact paper does the job. And yes, certainly these liners are more attractive than almost any contact paper, but for many shelves and drawers the liner is out of sight.For refrigerators, I immediately noticed that these liners were opaque (duh) and rendered the interior a shadowed cavern. They are certainly not going to line the veggie drawers at the bottom because, again, simply sponging out an unlined drawer is easier than removing odor-absorbing cloth liners that have to be washed.This is hypothetical, but I can actually see this liner being of use as a table runner; they look good and are cheaper than many runners of the same coverage. The second use would be on display shelves where the bare surface is unattractive. Choose the right color and the liner makes a very nice backdrop.The textile itself seems to be of quality construction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6H1HV92S8HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHB1EO#wasThisHelpful","R2L6H1HV92S8HY","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Sanford impresses more and more. Correct science in the ""science"" fiction: yes.  orbital mechanics, check. Brilliantly delineated cynical politicians, nailed it. Character development: people you learn to care about in peril. The Big Idea--unique! Pacing and suspense, yes yes yes.Humor, of course.Sanford brought Ctein aboard for the science, and in hundreds of pages, only once did my nerd radar twitch. There is a delightful postscript too, describing the science.Dialog is a Sanford forte and he carries it over to ""Saturn Run"". These are Joss Whedon, Aaron Sorkin level interchanges.And WHAT is out there orbiting Saturn? What a great concept he comes up with! I have read thousands of pages of SciFi and it is hard to come up with anything that has not been thought of before. I will of course be argued with, but for me, this exact concept is new, and that is amazing. I just can't talk about it because spoilers.I will say that keeping the crew of the ""Richard M. Nixon"" in the dark about the mysterious Chinese space vehicle gave an ominous tension to the book, and subsequent revelations inform us re human nature. Great way to handle that part of the story.I do have a complaint: it ended. Yes, it ended when it needed to end: not chopped short and not dragged out.

"I quite like the look and feel of this lightweight, minimalist case. If you must sacrifice the svelte 8 ounce thinness of the iPad 2 for the sake of protection (while traveling, for instance) and do not need water resistence, this is the case.I am not a fan of the screen protector- any screen protector, really. But the case itself feels good in the grip and is half the weight of the typical Otterbox. I am not about to test its claimed 6 foot drop protection, but it feels up to the task. The sharp 90 degree corners are surprisingly appealing to the eye and the touch. These corners deform under pressure for shock absorbtion, so it is claimed. One hopes.There are no button extensions to feel with your fingers, just faint embossments marking where you must press. Best to memorize to location of your power and volume controls. Pressing the proper spot does press the iPad's buttons properly but one star off because the embossments need to be thicker.A star off because the back shows fingerprints as badly as any screen.

"Dean Koontz is to Steven King as Robert Crais is to... every other crime/thriller writer I guess. By this I mean that he is more optimistic and affectionate toward humanity. There is a strong and overt moral compass in his outlook. Donald Westlake created the great anti hero Parker, and also his sometimes partner Grofield, who was the other side of the coin: wisecracking and light-hearted. Elvis Cole is Crais' Grofield, and Pike is his Parker. However, Of course, Crais being Crais, Pike is no thief and murderer.Here are some impressions about ""The Promise"".-Who knows how dogs think? But Crais writes GREAT dog. Maggie the ex-war dog is a wonderful creation, full of love and fierceness. You really really don't like to see her in peril, which of course, she is.-Bob Scott, a K9 patrolman, is a new character and a co-protagonist in the story beside Elvis Cole. He is a fleshed out character: young, ernest, and  emotional, loves his dog. We like him and of course, HE is in peril. More to worry about.-The story is complex and keeps us puzzling until it shakes out into a satisfying clarity well along in the story.-The rythme of action scene/exposition/detective work/more action is skilled.-The character Jon is introduced. I have a feeling we may see more of him, perhaps in a spinoff novel entirely devoted to his character, This is what happened with Elvis' sidekick Joe Pike, to my great pleasure (""The Watchman"", ""The First Rule"", etc.)-The sympathy and love shown toward Amy, the woman who lost her son, is moving.On the minus side:-""The Promise"" was not a compulsive page-turner. Somehow I found it easy to put down and not get back to for days.-What happens with Scott's girlfriend? She drops off the map.-Near the end of the book (no spoilers) the character ""Charles"" indicates big big internal conflict, and takes a radical action the motivation for which needs to be explored.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CU9GYH4PSX0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916149X#wasThisHelpful","R1CU9GYH4PSX0Y","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first in a series of books set in New York City about several wealthy siblings who have seen their parents and own relationships crash and burn so badly that none of them are interested in a relationship. This book is about the middle brother, Dane, and his experience meeting the lounge singer Julia for his new luxury hotel. While this author is new to me, it appears that this book is similar to others she has written, so if youre a Jennifer Gracen fan, you should be pleased with this new release.Gracen seems to lean toward writing steamier romance novels. Our two main protagonists are irresistibly, physically drawn to each other, which is fine since neither is looking for an emotional attachment. The book explores each characters discovery that there may be more to life than just sex, and that past wounds may be overcome if they are brave enough to extend themselves one more time.Why didnt I give this book 5 stars? While I enjoy steam, I find I prefer it in lighter doses. The author interweaves so many references to the physical attraction so often -- especially at the beginning of the book -- that for me, after so many small sips of seduction I just wanted to say yeah, yeah, yeah, can we just get back to the plot? by the time a full-on seduction scene actually commenced. It seemed like the efforts to promote chemistry actually reduced the effect for me.The first half of the book was a bit slower than the second half, but the last quarter of the book was great. Finally we dig into the emotional content that makes a book interesting to me. The characters finally become real and we finally have reasons to care about them. The author introduces that old  last-minute break-up/reunion trope. This is a pet peeve of mine which usually makes me roll my eyes. I was very happy to see that for once,the cause was actually realistic and believable.If you are looking for a steamy romance novel with wounded characters who ultimately find that missing something in each other, there is a good chance you'll enjoy this book.(Mrs. Js)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26L2WW2SOSPZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420139142#wasThisHelpful","R26L2WW2SOSPZP","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps Not.Four Stars, but really 5 star writing and 2 stars for making me unhappy in the particular way the story ends that sent me into a sulk.This is the book for those who want to share in the delicious  love-fest mass experience of Lord of the Rings  or Game of Thrones readers-- except for the ordeal of reading the stuff.How can you not honor a writer who pens:As usual a small number of Flemworthys more superfluous inhabitants had gathered in the Square to enjoy the spectacle of people parking their cars....she had abandoned work and gone off to be a pole-dancer in Lapland. Or was it a lap-dancer in Poland?Back in his dusky parlor, he fumbled at the experience like an ape looking for the edible parts of a digital camera.We cuddon see nothun cos the glass was covered in condescension.The author with the unlikely name of Mal Peet (I checked for wicked anagrams but no luck) produces rich prose indeed in the Murdstone trilogy, The Murstone Trilogy is much much more about the writer (or is he?) than the trilogy itself. We do indeed get some pages of fantastical description full of Morl and Swelts and Cadrel and the Greme and The Amulet of Power and whatnot. Not so much as to induce nausea or narcolepsy, but to give you the idea, before we return to poor Phillip Murdstone, much beset author and a man less than the sum of his parts who gets past a huge period of writers block to strike gold and tap into the most high voltage of all Muses to produce Dark Entropy, the biggest thing since LOTR and Harry Potter. This is due to the fantastical visit of Pocket. Pocket is a Greme, a kind of malign and more virulent version of Dobby the Elf in  Harry Potter. Beware Gremes bearing gifts, but wheres the story in that? Of course Phllip Murdstone makes his Faustian deal, and hilarity and horror ensue. Phillip's success is delicious, and the consequence as well.  *  *  *  *  *  *SPOILER:Do read this book, and skip perhaps the few chapters, when you sense things turning all wiggly, insert the Xtrapol8 computer program, slipped to Murdstones agent, the lovely Minerva by her publisher, into your own computer, and have it write the last few chapters, as it does 40% of all British soap operas, with Fecundity and narrative grasp (that are) extraordinary, and as it will the madness-deleted third and final part of the Murdstone Trilogy.And if it was ALL in his head, what of the Giant Fly?Finally, sadly, I learn that Mr. Peet died in March of 2015. I will never know if his ending was somewhat forced by his illness or deliberate. Sorry that I will be reading no more of his adult novels.

"I have gotten to the point where if I buy a tool it is going to last a lifetime because 1) My lifetime isn't all that much any more,  and 2) I finally see the false economy of less costly tools that are serviceable but not a pleasure to use.That being said,I don't turn up my nose at Black and Decker.  I couldn't always afford Knipex, Snap-On, or what have you. When you're on a budget, good enough will do. So no, this Black and Decker isn't buttery smooth and quiet like saws costing 3 and 4 times as much, but B&D has stepped up its game here.  It is a noisy little beast, but seems very well put together. They have designed a lot of value into an economical package. On the plus side:-Inserting/removing the blade is dead easy and intuitive and the blade is held securely.-The control for increasing orbital action is big, well marked, and easy to use.-You can attach a vacuum hose in the back, although you will probably need a step adapter for most American vacs.-The shoe adjusts from flat to about 25 degrees and then 45 degrees.Some of the compromises that had to be made to keep the price so affordable:-Again, noisy.-I find the light weight means you have to keep more downward pressure on the saw if the material is difficult; you can't completely let the saw do the work for you.-The vacuum suction intake is too far back to do much good.-The saw speed is variable by trigger pull, but you can't lock in a certain speed.-The trigger lock, unlike the orbital dial, is small and pressing it is finicky. It only locks at top speed.-The shoe has to be adjusted to only two positions: 25 or 45 degrees by means of a screw rather than a lever, but that is easy enough and a cost-saving compromise.-The power cord is only 7'. A 10' length or more would be nicer, buy hey, just leave an extension cord attached.-Finally, and most importantly, every time you pick it up you will hit the trigger and start the saw. The trigger is large and your grip naturally falls on the trigger. This could be dangerous.So with all those compromises, why 4 stars?

"I regard this watch as horological jewelry more than timepiece.  Recommended for vigorous young men with napoleon complexes attending  keggers. This monster watch weighs a third of a pound, is half an inch thick, and makes a statement without calling to mind the phallic compensation associated with sports cars. A swift backhand while wearing this Invicta will knock someone across the room.Encased in a big yellow box and  enthusiastically wrapped in plastic, paper, and cord against the rigors of international shipping, it takes time and dexterity to unwrap. Arrived ticking-- or humming, anyway.The battery is nonstandard but this just means send it to Invicta for a  $10 battery change plus shipping, or void the warranty by having the watch shop at the mall do the work, or even do it yourself once you open up the back and see what kind of battery it takes.Average wrist size of an American male is about 7.3 inches, with great variation. My left wrist is just that, about seven and a quarter inches. The Invicta comes sized for a 9 circumference wrist; too big for most, It is standard for metal bracelet watches to arrive sized large: It is easier to remove links to downsize than order extra links from Invicta. I had to remove 4 links, two to a side. This simple procedure will take a professional 4 minutes. It took me over an hour, but I am the un-handiest of handymen. Visit YouTube for instructions. After the resizing it fit perfectly. Further micro-adjustment can be made by moving the adjustment pin in the fold-over clasp.The watch felt absurdly heavy at first, but after 20 minutes I was completely used to it. The thickness means that the cuff of a long sleeve or dress shirt will hang up on the Invicta unless you use the widest button adjustment.I dont need to mention to actual divers that the Invicta Pro Diver watch is NOT an actual divers watch as per ISO 6425. It does not have a 2-way bezel, for one thing. and I find the silver numerals against the black background grayed out in dim light. White numerals would be better in the briny murk. The Roman numerals are raised, which is good, and the hands are white tipped- also good. The Crystal sits proud of the case but is slightly beveled which is a nice touch. The crown is protected by side projections and in any case feels solid when pulled out for adjustment. The crown pulls out easily and returns to seated position with a positive feeling. Adjustment is slightly loose-feeling but very smooth. I think that from a technical standpoint, this watch is a good value for the money.The Divers Watch description is not a problem. Scuba divers know what they need, and divers watch is acceptable shorthand for very water resistant and tough in the retail watch world. No need to be embarrassed if the guy next to you is wearing a G-Shock as long as you do not pretend youre a diver.A note on battery life: This watch ought to hold a fairly big battery; there is certainly the room for it. The batteries, even on analog watches, last a long time: a year, even several years. Mine last ""forever"" because I pull the stem out to stop the movement when they are going in a drawer for awhile. This reduces battery drain to almost nothing. This strategy requires a more elaborate reset every time if your watch has day/date, but for me that is easier than battery replacement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXPVM7ZGT48S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0821UA#wasThisHelpful","RXPVM7ZGT48S0","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: Nice color, matched a comparison leg very realistically Application is more even with the included soft mittCons: Irregular staining due to rougher skin areas or insufficient feathering, even with the nice mitt Visual enhancement of roughened skin (see inset in photo) was dramatic  rough skin went from invisible-at-a-distance to a dark, ugly splotch A slight odor, which isnt horrible If applied everywhere it results in a sticky feeling in crooks of arms and legs for most of the first day Can stain clothing, although the stain was very light and only seen on white fabricI dont use self-tanners often for two reasons:1. There is not usually much of me to see, as my legs are encased in jeans 99.9% of the time, and I favor 3/4 length sleeves, even in summer.2. Splotchy application in the past made my legs look even worse than their usual pale selves.I am planning a tropical vacation soon, however, and decided it was time to try them again to try to lessen the blinding whiteness of my legs.The mousse came with an application mitt, which has a short nap on one side. I really like the mitt. It keeps the mousse off your hands, and I made  it much easier to smooth out and feather blend any edges. (The mitt, by the way, is almost too small for my husbands medium-sized hand, but fit my small hand, well, handily.)For the first application I applied the mousse to my entire body directly after a shower. I first applied a small amount of regular body lotion to areas that tend to darken too much, such as my knees, tops of feet, and elbows.My photo shows a comparison of my leg with my husbands slightly tanned leg for comparison. I was pretty pleased with the After, as it gave me just a bit of color and removed that pasty white look. The downsides, however, were a slightly sticky feeling for quite a few hours, and the dreaded non-uniform absorption of the color, especially on my legs. One knee soaked in a lot more, and my ankles, as carefully as I tried to blend in the mousse, still had irregular dark and light areas. I also have one small patch of rough skin that soaked up a LOT of color, and went from invisible to really noticeable.Since my main interest was my legs, I decided to apply a bit more mousse to my lower legs after just a few days, since shaving seems to lighten them. I tried applying it without the mitt and decided that I much prefer using the mitt, it just feels like Im not leaving steaks. But doing just one section of a leg (the lower part) is really hard, and so I ended up with even more splotchy marks around my ankles and knees, since feathering out the mousse is still pretty hard.I was pretty happy with the appearance of the rest of my body, especially my arms and upper legs. I think the mitt helps spread the mousse out more evenly. It might be helpful to know how many squirts to use for a given area  I am small and tended to use four squirts for each whole leg, and maybe 2-3 squirts for each whole arm.Overall, I think this product is pretty average compared to the other self-tanners Ive tried in the past as far as application and irregular absorption, but has a better, more natural color. The application issues are inherent in all self-tanners, and the biggest advantage of this product appeared to be the mitt.(Mrs. Js)--and Mr. Js' leg TMI","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9H8894ERZR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOL1D66#wasThisHelpful","R3M9H8894ERZR3","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a feature, not a bug. I think maybe XEN-TAN has put a mix of skin dye and surface color into this lotion. The former gently and gradually darkens your skin with repeated applications and the latter can be wiped away if it is too much or blotched.I tried this to help balance the paleness of my neck to the more weathered appearance of my face. While I have a Xen-Tan mitt, I quickly decided that the fingers are the best applicator for the face. I liked how the instructions said to use a dime-sized amount, that was helpful.The material is fairly thick  definitely thicker than most lotions I apply. I wasnt sure whether it should be applied to my eyelids or not, but I went ahead and smoothed it over everything, trying to feather it carefully into my hairline and the front of my ears. Didnt want to end up with an abrupt line in such a visible location.The good news: I have very sensitive skin, and this product did not bother me. I never noticed an uneven appearance The color is very naturalThe weird surprise:I wash my face with a washcloth. I happened to wash my face 3 times in 24 hours after the first application, and was surprised to see a brownish residue on the washcloth, even after the third washing. Hence my thought that this lotion is not like the usual self-tanning lotions. However it works, it will definitely leave a residue on washcloths.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D882JDAAWM20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOL1D9I#wasThisHelpful","R3D882JDAAWM20","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are the version with no inline device controls.Get these for exercise, not the sound. They'll give you perceptible sound from 80Hz up to the limits of my hearing. Mid range is OK but smeary and somewhat harsh.Try all 3 earphone sizes. The proprietary tips fit securely and change easily.  I usually take a small in my left ear and medium in my right, but for some reason, the large size gave the best fit. I am a fan of tight seal earbuds but those make many people uncomfortable. The SoundSports stayed securely in my ears and are light and comfortable. They are well constructed.The Bose earpieces rest against and not inside the ear canal opening. The advantage is that if you want to hear your environment, like that car coming up behind you when you are running, these will allow that. The disadvantage is less volume and less bass, not that these have much. Efficiency is medium. There should be no problem producing enough volume in all but the noisiest of environments; for those, switch to earbuds that make a tight seal.Music is important to me, and many other in-ears sound more pleasant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQWGUNY6MR5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH5ZHG#wasThisHelpful","RAQWGUNY6MR5Q","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All in all, this is a light romantic read, and if you love Fools Gold, even after 18 books, youll love this one too. If, like me, you have read them all and are starting to feel as if most of the characters speak in the same voice  albeit a snarky, sassy, witty voice  you might find, as I do, that the series is getting a little stale.I like Susan Mallerys writing style. She keeps it upbeat and light, and is good about adding humor. If this were the first or fifth book of hers Id read, Id give it 4 or 5 stars. Shes always been an automatic buy for me.And  are there really so many people out there with trust issues, or who are afraid of love (or the possible pain that a broken relationship can cause)? Because they sure all ended up here. The romance in the Fools Gold series has become formulaic. I now prefer the authors womens fiction series, Blackberry Island and the new Mischief Bay, which are glimpses into the lives of several friends, and the emphasis is on the interrelationships, rather than the romance. Ive also enjoyed a few other authors who paint more believable, realistic characters, such as Penny Reid, Liza Palmer, Emily Giffin or JoJo Moyes.Personally, I love romances where the two main characters are attracted to and love each other from the outset, but circumstances (not fear) provides obstacles for them. If Susan Mallery were to put her excellent writing skills into a book where both protagonists were fighting *for* each other, that would be an amazing book.If youve never read one of the Fools Gold books before, no worries, each book is a standalone. But the background characters do repeat and its more fun to read in order. If you love Fools Gold and are looking forward to a new chapter, this book should be a satisfying return to a beloved, idealized small town.(Mrs. Js)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDAMSMSMRBN14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373788983#wasThisHelpful","RDAMSMSMRBN14","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have, when visiting, literally sneered at acquaintances who dared offer me their pathetic version of coffee. This was in my young and arrogant days when I thought that their tolerance was a measure of friendship. These days lifes lessons have humbled me; I value kindness more than coffee and admit that a hit of caffeine is what I need well before taste nirvana.That said, lets not poison ourselves. Drink as soon as you Grind as soon as you Roast. Practical considerations limit the number of times I  hit the mark and I count myself lucky if one cup in 5 is  perfect. I can think of a few situations where I would take this nifty little grinder on the road, but its real use for me is that one first cup in the morning.So enough with the barely relevant, here's my short take:Fill the little bin half full of beans and about 50 turns of the crank will give you 2 scoops of very fine grind. Back off on the knurled set-screw just a little and about 50 turns of the crank will give you 2 scoops of medium grind. Back off a little more and you get coarse grind. A small adjustment on the screw makes a big difference in the grind. Halfway up the view window will give you enough for one cup of coffee. If you fill up the whole grinding barrel you will get 3/4 cups. YMMVPros:-Your electric grinder will wake up the whole house in the morning. This grinder is stealthy quiet.-Light but well-built.-Intuitive operation (which is good because there are almost no instructions).-Compact and fairly easy to take apart.-No markings for gradation because they trust you to learn by an easy period of trial and error.-sturdy cleaning brush included.Cons:-Immersive cleaning will get water between the outer metal barrel and inner plastic window.-Practice your grinding technique so the nice big handle does not come off mid-grind.-Kind of messy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQUBM13L18TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R1HQUBM13L18TC","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were excited to try out the Exolens for iPhone 6. We love the photos our iPhone takes, but sometimes it would be nice to get a closer or wider angle. We took it to San Francisco for a field test. Please see the test photos.Pros: It slides on and off the phone very nicely. It has a firm grip, but not too firm, and it feels very smooth and does not harm the phone. Workmanship is first rate. Tolerances are perfect. Threads work smoothly and the little lens caps fit perfectly. If you have an image where the lens barrel distortion doesnt matter, it does bring in the subject quite nicely. See the photos of the workmen sandblasting the bridge and the last picture of the flag. The wide angle is really, really wide-Includes a nice lens shade.Cons: It would be preferable if the lenses screwed onto a case, instead of a frame. Take your case off and leave it off for the duration of your photo shoot with the Exolens. We found it difficult to swap out lenses quickly. It was very helpful to have two people, one to hold, one to affix the different lens and juggle the caps. The curvature introduced in the 3x was surprising  see images of the Golden Gate Bridge when its not centered  it is not subtle! Most of the time, the images were fuzzier than those taken without the device. They look OK on a phone screen but anything bigger reveals the fuzziness and distortion. Cropping down unmodified images resulted in better quality than the one taken with the 3x. White circle artifact in the flag photo shows the lens shade is often really necessary, sometimes even if the sun is way off to the sideOverall, the inconvenience of having to carry a separate set of lenses, trying to affix them quickly, resulting in distorted, fuzzy, low quality images, means we would not use these except in very rare instances. If we have to carry something else, a compact camera with a range of zoom settings (these were often either too zoomed in or too far out) would make a lot more sense and take up no more room in pocket or purse.So:-Here is an unmodified photo of some bridge or other with the iPhone 6 lens.-Next photo is an Exolens telephoto of bridge workers. Since the interest is at the center of the picture, the distortion of the girders is noticeable but OK. There is fuzziness.-Wide angle was  distorted and fuzzy.-Lastly a couple of telephoto shots. Ouch! (By the way, fairly good center sharpness on the telephoto flag shot).Carry a point-and-shoot, use panorama, or just crop your image.

"Describing the elusive flavor of this sweet, strong syrup is difficult. I simply do not have the vocabulary. I find myself resorting to the ""tastes like chicken"" trope. In this case, I have to go with ""tastes like butterscotch"".  And it does until you taste it next to butterscotch and realize it is not quite that. And bear in mind this is syrup from the coconut palm, and ONLY that. No guar gum, no ""artificial"" flavor, no sodium hexametaphosphate, just coconut palm syrup.First use was the classic syrup employment of waffle sauce: go easy because the flavor is more intense than artificially flavored maple syrup; almost as strong as real class B maple syrup... I like maple syrup better but it would be an OK substitute if, for some weird reason, you were allergic to maple. Anything is possible; I'm allergic to beets.Next application was vanilla ice cream. Chameleon-like, this coconut palm syrup tastes really close to butterscotch, and you can drizzle a LOT less on top because of its strong flavor. A definite success.Next: spaghetti sauce. I could not detect any difference from using brown sugar. I think my next try will be as a glaze on sweet potatoes and grilled meats. I will update.Conclusion: I think chefs should experiment with this very interesting new ammo in their culinary arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNDZEQSR1FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1C8G7W#wasThisHelpful","RZNDZEQSR1FF","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love the ending of this story and I know all the explanations will never match our imaginations.As well written as always, this Baxter novel is a Big Story gulping up big swaths of time and space. There are AI's who may not be our friends. There are big political/military power blocs. There's space travel and murder and betrayal. Our hero, Yuri, has a Big Secret (which is... meh) and a nice rhythm to the pacing that never leaves you bored.Future society calls the 21st century  ""The Heroic Years"" is a fully ironic sense. Big projects, big waste, big harm to the planet. The development of new artificial intelligence is now banned. Big projects that waste energy are not tolerated. The only reason we contemplate colonizing  of Proxima Centauri  IV is that mysterious energy ""Kernals"" have been discovered on Mercury. We don't understand them, but we can use them to power a few great big colony vessels to Proxima as a kind of last-gasp  high-water mark of the Heroic Years.I am giving this book 5 stars even though the whole Colony Ship idea is such baloney. You don't stock such a vessel with criminals and misfits whose only positive quality need be ""genetic diversity"". One of them doesn't even know he IS on a ship!You also keep them in suspended animation, not wake them up years before arrival to consume supplies and cause trouble. So silly.  Let's make this amazing effort to reach another planet and them toss them out onto this planet with some power bars and basic tools.  Nonetheless, the characters are so entertaining and the story so good that I have forgiveness for a some nonsense.The hinting of a possible alternate reality is tasty and restrained. How Proxima IV REALLY gets colonized is great fun. The natives are imagination's flower. The rolling robot that follows some of our characters around the planet is our new Robby the Robot, a wonderful character.Occasionally some vast and hidden string-pulling intelligence whispers to life with suggestive, italicized thoughts about what really might be going on with the Kernals and the Hatch (no spoilers re the hatch).The Penultimate chapter... wow. No spoilers.The ending disappointed a lot of people. I think it's great if that were the end. The fact that so much is unexplained is, I think, a virtue, not a failing, and will be undone in the sequel with something I fear will be banal and derivative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7XVAUEW495GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467701#wasThisHelpful","R7XVAUEW495GP","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But an exciting series of chases. From the first sentence of the book we are catapulted (now there's a just jacket blurb verb) into the action. Our teenage heroine ends up blasted and shot at, soaked and punched and on the run with almost no resources, and those are just the first few pages. A typical American teenager of current fiction, Jenna is quick to begin resenting her father despite some extremely positive actions on his part to keep her little hind end intact. This theme continues throughout the book and becomes a bit tedious, as do the chases. Just the same, the action flows naturally and does not have the robotic clockwork formula feeling of a Dan Brown thriller. In fact, repeatedly Jenna's father grumps about the lack of realism in action movies and television shows. The author and I share the same pet peeves.Jenna's origins are the big mystery, and we get our answers doled out in small breaks from the action in the form of flashbacks and exposition. Can anybody be trusted? Why are various Federal agencies tripping over each other like Keystone Kops? In fact, not just tripping over each other but shooting up big and expensive installations in a hail of gunfire. There seems to be an amazing willingness to kill civilians and cops as well. Although young adult in form, this novel has plenty of gruesome death.On the plus side, the writing is clear, syntax lucid, and vocabulary and grammar all get a pass. This is no small thing these days when it seems anything can get published and good editors are scarce. The action shows a good grasp of physics. Nobody is surviving bomb blasts without a good reason nor flying cars off parking garage roofs into adjacent office buildings. On the other hand, people seem to heal up pretty darn fast from bullet wounds to little areas like, say, the thigh; up and about on crutches in hours.In the end, it all turns out to have Big Answers that lead to more Big Questions with ""to be continued"" stamped all over them. I believe the authors have this all planned out and when we get to the answers it may not have been worth it. I think I will wait on the reviews when the sequel comes out, because I am not waiting with bated breath.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZOV57225PMNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941539017#wasThisHelpful","RZOV57225PMNU","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do not try to figure out the instructions before you check out this official Dyson video for a similar product on Youtube. the video exudes condescension, but  mutely shows you what you need to know.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spo8itk_chYI wanted it, then I hated it, then I loved it, now I know its just OKI learned 3 lessons from trying out the Dyson Big Ball:1)  New and different isnt always better.2)  I vacuum too fast. Make slow passes.3) Cost correlates only loosely with quality.Nothing works like actual real-world testing to knock down you biases.I compared the Dyson to my trusty and well-rated Eureka Boss Upright.-The Dyson would be superior because it is so expensive.-The Dyson would be bad because the pictographic instructions were so really, really poor.-It would vacuum really well because marketing says so.Then came the test. I poured out 3 Tbsp's sand/ 2 Tbsp's salt onto a deep pile rug.The Dyson pulled up 95% with its first 6 passes, then a little more with 6 more slow passes.The Eureka pulled up 98% with  the same first passes, then a little more with 6 more passes. Photos below.I ran both vacs sideways along an outside wall edge littered with tiny birch seeds. The Eureka sucked in most of the seeds right up to the edge of the building; the Dyson got 40%The Dyson steers better once you learn to lean the machine as well as twist your wrist.Both machines take 3 moves to ready the wand for its attachments, The Dyson is much harder to re-seat.The crevice tool on the Eureka is better: slim and tapered. The Dysons is wider with a ridged snout: poor design.Far more tools on the Dyson. Some of them are unique and let your imagination be your guide as to how to use some of them. My imagination came up with zero ways. A very silly collection of tools that come with a separate poorly designed bag with a shoulder strap. The side pockets are too shallow and/or narrow to hold the tools. The central storage can easily hold all the tools in a jumble.Some good Dyson things:-though not as quiet as a Miele, it is 2 dB quieter than the Eureka. Not quiet, but quieter.Dyson has a nifty little turbo counter-rotating brush that resists tangling to use on pet hair. It worked wonderfully with a bunch of thread.  This brush is a great attachment; Kudos Dyson.Dyson has a transparent dust bin that shows you when to empty it. Emptying is really easy although a bit of a dusty job if you are not careful. There are NO filters to periodically replace. Good good good.The Eureka uses a dust bag that is easy to change-out and keep all the dust inside, but if you let it get too full you lose suction. Not good.The Dyson looks like some cool alien dropped it out of a UFO.Notes:-Unlike some reviewers, I had no trouble getting this vacuum to stand up straight.-The cord is of good quality: nice and long.-Vacuum slowly. Time and again I noted that fast passes leave lots of dirt. 2 slow passes beat  4 fast back-and-forths every time.-On the crevice tool push the button and pull back to expose the tip.-On the flex wand push the button and push forward.Conclusion: For a lot more money you get a cool-looking vacuum with no filters or bags to bother with that is almost as good as the Eureka Boss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3SIYVIFU70F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJPS2#wasThisHelpful","R2J3SIYVIFU70F","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Updated and uprated. We are through much of the summer now and no more poor birdies getting conked.From the photo (bottom right) of this particular window you can see why the poor birds  experience startling stops midair a couple of times a month in the Spring and Summer when the lighting is just wrong, We jump in our chairs to hear the hearty THUMP. Another bird has seen open space where there was none and we look down to see if this one will pick itself up, brush off its feathers and fly away-- or twitch a time or two and die. Anthropomorphization aside, we dont like the alarming noise nor bonked birds bamboozled by our clean windows.Will these work? An arbitrary 4 stars for now to be upgraded if we get through the season without more birdy head-banging and a big down-grade if they fail....and success.The Birds Eye View window film looks good. Im not a fan of faux stained glass film nor little stick-on flowers. These are more subtle and elegant. Thumbs up on the aesthetics.3 methods alert the birds:-UV light reflection, which most birds see better than us.-Dichroic glass effects which shift the color on the surface. I don't think this will work for us because this is a north-facing window-Textured pattern simply shows the bird that something solid is there.It was very easy to apply. Peel the film from its backing and stick it on a wet window. Slide it just where you want it. Press out any bubbles, of which we had none. You're done with all 4 pieces in minutes unless you are OCD about alignment.We live in hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218X1CDMCY94D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K65NNG2#wasThisHelpful","R218X1CDMCY94D","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A grudging 4 stars. SO many factors to consider. Too bad you can't take a vacuum cleaner for a long test-clean.I compared the well-reviewed Eureka Boss against the Hoover Commercial Windtunnel.  Short take: Eureka is somewhat better for me. But it is more complicated than that. Here are some of the factors to consider:Performance on a deep pile rug: Eureka wins. without telling my wife, I poured 1 Tbsp sand, 1 Tbsp salt, 1 Tbsp flour on our rug (see photo below) and made three slow back and forth passes with each machine. Then I ruthlessly cut open the bags and measured the take. The Eureka sucked up 2 ozs. and the Hoover was 1.9 oz. (see cup o' dirt photo below). That is pretty much a tie.Cord length: Hoover wins by 10 feet BUT the cord is somewhat fat and awkward.Noise: A tie.  84 dB on my sound meter BUT the Eureka is a hushed roar while the Hoover Windtunnel is a banshee shriek. It is very wearing.Stairs: Hoover is the clear winner. It is 2 lbs. lighter and has a smaller width that is easier to maneuver. BUT a narrower track means more passes.Attachments: A tie. Hoover tools snap in tighter than Eureka's BUT remember to point the upholstery brush down in its clip so you can wind the cord.Bags: A tie. Both are easy to change although i find the Hoover Windtunnel bag door finicky to open and close.Floor illumination: Hoover wins. It is not that bright but a lot better than the pathetic Eureka light.Getting under furniture: A tie. They can both get in 12"" if the furniture has an eight inch lip. Neither will equal a canister with power brush.Power switch: Eureka wins. It has a bigger, easier to reach switch that is not recessed. Both would be better if the switch were on the handle.Floor maneuverability: Hoover wins. This is a big one if you have a lot of floor to do. The Hoover Commercial Windtunnel is a bit easier to push around and turn... and a ""bit easier"" starts to mean a lot if you really are doing commercial-sized work, like a floor of offices. It was not a factor for me with just one floor of rug to vacuum.So personally I like the Eureka because it is subjectively quieter, is slightly more powerful, and has a slightly wider track which works for me because I don't need to get it into narrow spaces. I can describe the differences but can't call a winner for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4UV67BT06AQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MDM4RS#wasThisHelpful","R4UV67BT06AQL","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WellA couple of quick thoughts. First: raised a Catholic, I realize for complexity, tradition, guilt-- we are amateurs compared to the Hassidic Jews. Wow.  Second: I took this not as a story about a branch of Judaism so much as a story of religion in general, of Humanity, spirituality, of what we seek, what we need or think we need; a universal story.I set this book down feeling as if I had walked blinking out of some intense movie that engulfed and distracted me from everyday life.. So yes, good story. I did not realize it was a memoire at first. I thought it was fiction, not because of any lack of credibility but because it seemed so fantastic. Don R. suggested that if I wanted to read a real time-travel story, I might try this one. It seems more like another world, parallel to the one I know.I loved the look at a branch of Judaism so insulated and protected that indeed, English is truly a second language. Vending machines are an attractive and dangerous novelty, and radios are regarded as a dangerous window into a world of temptation (as indeed they are). As well as the radio, television and the internet are the apple in this Eden. Ah, the internet: blogs, community, social networks-- people who have the same crazy thoughts you do.Deen knows how to write, and how to structure. The story starts with his expulsion. He is being kicked out of the Skeverers. How did it come to this? How did it all start? So begins his story, moving back and forth between diligent Talmudic scholar, disinterested youth, ecstatically transported True Believer, and the big mess he got into by asking questions, questions that were not the allowed questions, the claustrophobically naval gazing minutiae just as well as the profound philosophical stuff, but the dangerous questions.Do I come away from this viewing the Skeverers negatively. Why yes, yes I do. Religion in general, I believe, starts out with good stories to make children and then adults behave. Dont steal, dont murder, dont hate. Be part of a social and cooperative entity for your good and the good of all. But in no time at all, if being a part of your religion is very good, then NOT being a part of it must be bad for you then bad for everyone, then a sin and then a crime. Fortunately for Shulem Deen, his sect is something of a hot house flower, without great secular power and poor indeed-- in fact surviving somewhat on the the welfare and the good wishes and tolerance of others.  They could onlySPOILER--only punish him by denying him his children. But to do that shows what might be done if there were more power in their hands, say the power of the Catholic church when it burned heretics, Islam with its murtad fitri punishments for the fallen away.And yet, Shulem Deen does not sugar coat his lack of belief. He is not happy with the loss, with the hollowness in place of the early ecstasy, with the empty feeling he has. I think this is a very brave story.Give this book time to unfold. It is not a happy story; not a sad story. It is a life story and it ends with more questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PRWCVKDCHW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRWK334#wasThisHelpful","R10PRWCVKDCHW8","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Top thing I love about this case is that it offers real protection but still leaves the retina screen uncovered. My peeve is that fingerprint password function is somewhat compromised, sometimes taking three tries and the volume buttons are hard to use.Quick conclusion: I will use this case with confidence on the road, and pry it off to enjoy the  naked iPad at home.I tried a case for my original iPad 2 and gave it up. It was very good but just too bulky and clumsy. This case is much better. My old iPad, while perfectly functional, and with a flawless screen, looks scratched and beat up from the backside. That is why I want this iPad Air2 to live in a case. This is somewhat paradoxical, like covering your furniture with plastic so someone else can enjoy it after you put up with the vinyl. OTOH, this thing cost a bundle and I do NOT want to break it.Push down HARD with both thumbs all along the edges to snap the case closed. I was irritated until I realized the very tight fit and exacting tolerance of manufacture are what  keeps water out and still allows this case to be relatively slim.Included with the Lifeproof Nuud is a  stand-in for your iPad: a blue plastic blank in the shape of the iPad. Use it to see if  the case is good and to practice the closure procedure, try  first with this plastic stand-in. I put some tissue paper inside as well, and immersed it in about 8 inches of water. An hour later, that tissue was dry. While the specs say you're safe to 6', which my iPad will never see if I am careful, mere rain will certainly not be a worry. Lifeproof claims good drop protection too. If I am unlucky that test will be performed unintentionally sometime in the future  and I will update... But I am pretty careful.-It is surprising how good the sound quality is with the speakers blocked by thin plastic diaphragms. High frequencies and volume are somewhat compromised.-Enter your fingerprints BEFORE closing the case. The sensor area is reduced once the case is on. My fat thumb still worked but I added my litle finger because it fits better in the newly circumscribed sensor area and should lead to quicker recognition.-The weight of the iPad Air2 with this case feels about the same as my original iPad2 with no case but with the folding cover.-If you have a folding cover, put it back in the box. It won't work.-Despite its slimness you have lost the amazingly svelte original form factor.No one will know that you have a cool new iPad Air 2 once this black, anonymous case is on. What do you want, to impress people, or protect your costly purchase?I love that while this case is highly water resistant, it still leaves the screen exposed. There is no compromise of your retina screen resolution or touch sensitivity.A negative that will reduce star rating for you if photography with your iPad is important: I believe the extra layer of plastic over the lens reduces clarity and slows focus. Incidentally, there seem to be a bunch of people in the media who think using your iPad for photography is bad. I find their reasons weak or irrationally concerned with what others may think of you. Do what you want.There is a flap that covers the ear bud port. I often use ear buds when surfing the internet sitting on the sofa next to my wife so she won't have to listen to cats meowing. There is a adapter you can use that retains waterproofing. I am not going to use it because I think I will lose it and I only use the ear buds indoors, where it does not often rain.A little orange tool is provided to help you remove the case. I gave up and used a quarter coin held with a pliers. THAT is how tough this case holds together and how hard it is to get off. Forget doing it by hand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL425YCM4JI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG9Q0C6#wasThisHelpful","R2CL425YCM4JI0","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since we went with a 3 star rating, lets mention the positives first:Set up was smooth.Great operation interface.The double-sided printing worked really well.The auto document feeder worked well.Its been pretty easy to use so far.Ink cartridge installation is so easy.Speedy printing when set at low quality for in-house use.All very good However:The printing quality in general is not what we consider acceptable to hand out to customers or clients. Skip down to PRINT QUALITY for that assessment.We wanted to like this printer. Its got all sorts of features that we could use  printing on 11x17, double-sided printing, fax, scanning, and more. But this printer is presented as a high-volume alternative for small businesses. They also say spend less for more pages. Maybe they achieve that by using a tiny amount of ink compared to other printers. While the printer itself is pleasing to use so far, with an excellent on-screen interface and speedy delivery of regular print jobs of low quality, everything Ive printed is dull and lifeless in comparison to our HP Photosmart 7525 or our old Brother MFX laser fax/scanner/printer.SETUP AND INSTALLATIONAlthough set up went pretty smoothly, although there were several things that were a bit tricky to figure out:-Loading the paper: to adjust the paper guides, press the little tab on the right green vertical slider.manual feed sheets need to be set printing side up (which matters with photo paper).-Pulling out the paper support after loading the paper: the illustration makes it look like you pull from the sides, but you actually just pull out the 2 wide section in the middle.-Closing the lid for the phone cord access  turns out you just press it down, gently. It resists at first, and we kept looking for a latch to press to release, but no, just press.-I really liked the inkjet cartridge installation  the green lever one must swivel to remove the orange seal on the cartridge is so much easier than our HP printer cartridge. And we liked how easy it was to tell when they were fully seated  the tab just pops up. Not much of a clicking sound, but it was still very easy.The driver installed easily on our Mac computer, and setting it up as a wireless printer went very smoothly, despite our not having a USB cable long enough to reach from the computer to the printer.When the printer initializes the first time, it takes about 5 minutes, then another few minutes where you have to follow the onscreen instructions. One of the steps is to set up the paper trays. Note that you need to designate the TYPE of paper (inkjet, regular, photo) as well as the size, because if you choose inkjet paper on the printer and the paper tray is designated regular, the printer wont print. But it walks you through correcting the problem very quickly.PRINT QUALITYSee our photos for several tests we did, comparing this printer to our HP Photosmart 7525. Obviously the HP is going to do well with the photos, but it was sad to see how much better it does. And when both printers were set to best photo quality, with the appropriate glossy paper settings, the HP printed a beautiful, color correct copy in 2 min 30 sec, while this printer took 6 min 10 sec to print a faded copy.Even a standard sheet of black and white text looks faded next to our HP printer, and even more so compared to a laser printer.On the plus side, there was some yelling at the HP printer over its refusal to print because the paper size is not set correctly, and while the Brother experience was not perfect, the machines really great interface on the front panel pointed out what we were doing wrong and allowed us to change settings, resulting in far less frustration. For photos, the easiest thing is to take them down to the one-hour photo at Costco!When the printer initializes the first time, it takes about 5 minutes, then another few minutes where you have to follow the onscreen instructions.

"First off, the Thera Breath Plus matte silver bottle with its orange safety seal looks like some kind of scary bio-war canister: serious, like it means business. Thats good marketing! I like it.3 stars because the formulators of this mouthwash try so hard to make it natural and non-alcoholic. I imagine that it might do a mighty job of suppressing or banishing odors of oral origin.  Mouthwash works in the mouth and throat, and cant touch what is going on in the stomach. Vapors emitted from deeper in the alimentary tract issue forth through the throat and mouth, but only as a miasma decorated with a minty bow, noxious nonetheless.French Onion Soup:It is my bane. I am possessed  with fairly neutral breath, even in the morning, but delicious french onion soup or similar onion-based soups  transform me into an oral toxic broadcaster  for hours.

Again, a long time, took about 5 breaths, but I did it.It stings. Not as bad as Listerine or some of the other alcohol-based nostrums, Still, I was tempted to rinse lightly with water a minute afterwards to get the sting out.

"Update: It is bee season now. It seems because the flowers angle outward instead of facing up allows more of the nectar to remain accessible to the bees. They are now making regular visits. Admittedly, this is not stopping the bummers, but I have to be careful not to bring bees in the house when I refill the feeder. So I'm downrating.Yow! When I pulled this Perky-Pet double decker from its plastic cocoon, though e flowers were so big! They looked kitschy. But fear not: once out in the backyard 'midst the real blooms they compete with, they fit right in. The HBirds won't miss these babies.Not that the Hbirds appreciate the extra feeding stations. As usual, they spend half their energy in a ""mine, not yours'"" territorial dogfighting aerial gavotte. Well, I suppose Nature knows best and this is a winning strategy. Sticking up a post-it note reading ""chill out"" is completely ineffective.However, the double-decker easily separates. Hang one around the corner and the beta birds have their chance, while that big (Relatively speaking) redheaded bully of an alpha bird exhausts himself trying to cover two bases; serves him right.Pros:-prettier than you would think.-does not leak for once, YMMV.-easy to separate parts for cleaning.-the upper and lower units detach and reattach easily and securely.-plastic construction is light and unlikely to break.Cons:-plastic construction is also a con for some; glass feeders are more elegant.-the smaller top unit is a little fiddley to close and seal securely.-the plastic tanks are slightly cloudy instead of clear as glass.

"Firstly, how can Command Wall Hanging Systems Market these kits? You cant really understand how cool they are until you get them in your hands. I recommend J-J-J-Jinx video review posted on 4/27/15, and also some of the reviews with photos. This system can really class up the joint with very little work. These 3-dimensional display boxes really pop, and project a pro-decorator aura at a really low price. So: mucho aesthetic bang for the buck.The kit we were provided with to review came with 3 tiles, one riser and 4 strips packaged together. The corners of each art tile were protected by thick cardboard. There is one extra strip in case you make a mistake. There are individual levels on each base"", so you can easily make sure its straight before pressing down to affix the strip to the wall. All in all a well-thought-out system to make it super easy to spiff up a wall.My only nits are these: - It says to wipe the wall with rubbing alcohol. Theyve done such a great job of making it so easy, but there were no alcohol pads. That seems like an easy add to really ensure these successfully adhere to the wall. - The plastic transparency over the photo is anti-glare so the photo is not seen quite as clearly as it would be through glass. Also, if you stand close, the slightest raggedness at the outboard edges of the box tend to look white against the black background, which looks a bit cheap.Here are a few tips:1. Read the instructions and look at the individual pieces and understand how the system works before you install. Although the system is pretty forgiving, so even if you dont, you wont get in too much trouble.2. When cleaning the wall with rubbing alcohol, mark where youve cleaned it, so you dont lose track once its dry.3. When they say to affix the base to the wall, dont affix the riser if you have one. The base has a level, the risers dont.I love the risers, I really like overlapped look. The magnets are way cool, I love how easy it is to pop the artwork off to change it out, and . alignment is automatically perfect  If youre creative, once you have the base system installed it seems like it would be easy to customize these.-Mrs. Js... mostly","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UXV1ZBHVT5Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7MOM#wasThisHelpful","R1UXV1ZBHVT5Q6","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read Thrillers and SciFi. I like spies and murders and aliens. This is literature. While I say ""literature"", what I usually mean is ""painful"". But ""Lifted by the Great Nothing"" was not a slog. Although the story is as serious as life can be serious, it is not mired in dour pessimism and understands that life is always not so serious, sometimes even when it is.Young Max is being raised by his single parent, his strange father whom Max wants to make happy. In a rapid arc, Max is a child, a boy, a young man who would have been better served by honesty than the bodyguard of lies cosseting him. By the end of his 17th year he finds out all. It is a mad story but a very human one. I found his life fantastic yet utterly believable.Karim Dimechkie is a fine writer with a good ear. There are no blunders that take you out of the narrative. The story flows organically and is an easy read, even when things get painful for our characters. There is an explicit sex scene that I found believable and erotic.There is a camukra flower that blooms once every 14 years or so. It blooms at the beginning of the story and blooms at the end. I guess it is supposed to be symbolic but I did not even try to think of what it was supposed to mean. Maybe the author threw it in because it felt cool and he figured we would do little mental gyrations trying to make it significant. The ending is abrupt and the tone not quite right. How our storyteller could have made it better, or richer, or more meaningful is beyond me. I have not an ounce of creative writing in me, but an appreciation for 95% of a well-imagined young man's story. But then, real life is like that sometimes. Narratives sometimes don't come with a neat ribbon tying everything up. (But I want the ribbon).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSUJN2ZGDY94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632860589#wasThisHelpful","R2QSUJN2ZGDY94","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never actually taste bottled sauces before loading them up like crazy with green bell pepper, onion, and oregano. As a taste test, this time I spooned the  cheese and bacon Barilla and Meat All Natural Barilla straight from the jar as if I were some kind of wine taster. And then again I spooned the sauce after adding ground meat and simmering for awhile.Taste impressions before cooking: The bacon and cheese REALLY did taste of bacon and cheese. Sounds overdone but made my tongue happy. The basic Meat All Natural Sauce made me conscious that the tomato flavor could have been sweeter but there was a good basic integrity to the sauce. What does ""integrity"" mean? Well, we really don't have a taste vocabulary analogous to the famous and possibly apocryphal ""43 words for snow"" of the Inuit people, so I will have to go with ""tastes good"". I give the Bacon and Cheese 3 stars and the Meat All Natural Sauce  a 4 with the sweetness having improved after heating and sitting overnight.In the end, it was the Traditional that I kept coming back to. The Bacon and Cheese is a bit too artificial.I spooned out sample 1 and sample 2 for Mrs. Js, the Taste Queen. Her opinion? Barilla Traditional Meat Sauce: ""Yum"". Barilla Bacon and Cheese: ""Yum.""

"Latex gloves are preferred by most surgeons for their fingertip sensitivity (see Purdue pegboard test) but the difference is small and nitrile gloves are tougher and more puncture-resistant. The toughness wins out over the slight fingertip conformability of  latex. I am not doing Cholecystectomys in my garage.Even better, Gloveworks HD nitriles are 9 mils and even tougher than your average nitrile glove and I perceived very little if any diminution in dexterity. A box of 100 is MUCH heavier and bigger than a box of 5 mil. By the way, I had to do some research to discover the thickness. I did not see it ANYWHERE on the box: a surprising omission of such a virtue.I have the XLs for my medium hands and they are just slightly tight at the palm and slightly long at the fingertips; a good compromise for me.Realistically, although great for a day's wear to keep dirt and grease off your hands, they will not do for long out in the garden wielding a rake or pruning thorny bushes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9CQSTS4I64Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGSGN46#wasThisHelpful","R2F9CQSTS4I64Y","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One star off because Scotts Grass Seed rufuses to spring into green life in a couple of weeks when I just toss it on almost bare ground barely moistened and otherwise unprepared by any effort on my part. So lazy! Update: after 2 months, this has been Rogain for my lawn.Scotts reasonably asks you to rake or otherwise stir up the ground, water regularly and perhaps thrown down a little topsoil so the seed has some moisture-holding surroundings to promote germination. Unsurprisingly, the seed I 'cast liberally on bare ground just sat there. Surprisingly, at least if last year is any measure, even my poor preparation did not stop the seeds from sprouting after about 4 weeks.On a positive, 4-star note, the thin and brown spots within the main body of the lawn have sprung up enthusiastically. If you take a picture, mental or literal, and water some every day, it works lots faster than Rogaine. The lawn is much fuller where I seeded. Seeds appreciate some cover.This ""Turf Builder"" seed is recommended for sunny AND shady areas. Well, it is still struggling in the shaded area. It is not working miracles.

"""Becoming Steve Jobs"" has a narrow premise, sticks to it, and succeeds. Steve Jobs began as a product-driven, cruel company-smashing maniacal marketing genius, and rebuilt himself into a product-driven sometimes humane, super company-building CEO maniacal marketing genius. Although BSJ is an unauthorized biography, it is actually far more authorized than Walter Isaacson's ""Steve Jobs"" because of Brent Schendler's access to very high-level colleagues such as Iger, Ives, Cook, Catmul, Gates and of course, Steve's wife Laurene.This isn't an in-depth analysis of the technology, which I would have liked. Nor are there many anecdotes from the many, many interesting people Jobs interacted with during his amazing life. It is a broad and illuminating look at how Jobs became a really good boss instead of a bomb inside the company gas tank. It is also, through interviews, the story of how Steve got less mean, more patient, and wiser. It separates his behavior outside of work: some people NEVER got yelled at by Steve. Starting a family with Laurene changed him. Watching creativity being gently fostered at Pixar, his ""side bet purchase"" changed him. He learned. He grew.As for the leaps that were the music player, phone, and tablet look elsewhere for a real description of their technology and social impact. Although they are covered as pivotal events, the focus is always on Jobs, and that is fine.There is a lot left untold in this useful new addition to the Lore Of Steve. I want more personal stories. I want more about the tech... lots more. Still, this is an excellent overview and the quotes from his friends and colleagues are valuable.Oh, and one more thing: The book was written with love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCAPBUYI731T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCWY8#wasThisHelpful","R1LCAPBUYI731T","A3MJ1OH04JQNQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJ1OH04JQNQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are many bloggers on the internet, and many eCommerce businesses-- so, how does one distinguish oneself to the point of making it all profitable for You? This book is packed efficiently with a plethora of essential chapters covering every aspect of blogging for your online store, and with links throughout to online resources (the author's even provide a list of links they used to sites, if you are reading a hard copy).I had a thousand questions when I sought out this book and then first cracked the cover. It seems the movement of traffic to a site should be easy: of course, it is not. Everything is right there if you simply have internet access and a device of some sort to actually access it! But this is far from the truth. Yet, as we are shown herein, this is Not 'a mountain too high.'This book breaks it all down into 8 manageable chapters. Beginning simply, we get to cover content, traffic, building an audience & more ... the Basics of Blogging for Beginners, as it were, but essential and the ideal place to get our feet wet. Next we go over actual tactics for our strategy: what are listicles, including 'How To's' and interviews, and more.Further, Keywords are vital for people (potential customers) searching online: lure them in. The authors take us through using certain features on Google, in particular-- and given the ubiquitousness of Google it is crucial to learn how to use it. But also phrases & tools and much in between to make the most with the right bait.If you are not a writer, this is something you will have to overcome. But it is Not difficult.. hang in! This is about simply relating to the reader out there, description, using email, outsources-- a singularly critical chapter here. Of course we go through dressing up your posts, graphics and more also. And all throughout we get links of real sites the authors highlight for numerous helpful reasons.RSS, webmasters, permalinks, slugs-- there is a lot in here you have probably heard about before, but maybe didn't quite know what it all was. It is explained easily for us. Some further work in the realm of SEO (search engine optimization), and how to share your posts the most effectively, I.E., using social media (we've all heard of this, but don't be frightened it won't bite ;), and so on.If I write any more on it I would have my own book to publish-- and it would look suspiciously just like this one!

"Orphans always have a way at tugging at the heartstrings, and Alex O'Sullivan is no exception. Born with spina bifida and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, he never knew his parents. Not only that, but he was told they tragically perished in a fiery car crash. He wasn't just given up for adoption, he was left without any living family members and thrown into an impersonal foster care system to fend for himself.But what makes Michael J. Bowler's young adult characters so unique is how adoption can become a life-changing, transformative process for themif they connect with the right people who are willing to care for them. Once placed in a loving, stable environment, they finally get a chance to flourish and thrive.The novel starts out with Alex at the mercy of his current foster guardian, Jane. She's the worst of the worst, a manipulative con artist who's only in it for the money. She takes in as many juvenile offenders, former gang members and handicapped teens as she can house under her roof, siphoning every last penny out of the stipend she receives from the state. She gets away with feeding them next to nothing, and even encourages them to pummel each other while videotaping their altercations, hoping to make a quick buck on the side. This is her way of punishing them for ""starting trouble.""But despite her numerous threats of intimidation and her constant barrage of verbal abuse, Jane is afraid of Alex. He has a secret power, an uncanny ability to control her emotions whenever she speaks. It's a special gift he dubs ""spinning,"" hence making him the ""Spinner"" of the book's title. For Alex, spinning is the only thing he's good at.Yet not all adults fear Alex's talent. Nathan, the father of his best friend, thinks he possesses an extraordinary gift. He welcomes Alex into his home without trepidation, seeking to adopt him and make him a permanent member of the family. He knows how close his son, Roy, is with Alex and how many times Alex has saved his boy from mortal danger, and he wants to offer Alex some kind of protection. Nathan is genuinely concerned about Alex's well-being. He knows how Jane treats him, and he wants to get him out of her house for good.Alex is grateful for Nathan's offer of assistance until a boatload of secrets from his past begin to emerge, starting with a video message from his dead mother that Jane tries to keep from him. Is he ""the boy with round legs"" who's the source of an ancient Iroquois legend and the healer the Bible itself references? As he begins to sort through the clues his mom left for him to uncover his true identity, he learns that he may not be alone in the world after all. There just might be someone who shares a special bond with him that runs a whole lot deeper than blooda conjoined power that could very well corrupt the entire human race.Alex faces a tricky dilemma. Does he move on and start a new life with the people who mean the most to him? Or does he explore this new tie to his affections that he never even knew existed until now? It's a weighty decision for a fifteen year old to make, but the beauty of a Michael J. Bowler novel is that he always gives his adolescent protagonists the power to choose what they want based on what kind of person they want to be.It's a dual journey of self-discovery and acceptance that culminates in an epic battle between the forces of good and evil. Will Alex be the great peacemaker or the great destroyer? Will he choose love over hate?Bowler sums it up best, ""Thoughts don't make us good or evil. Actions do.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAGJNDQIXM7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFLMTUO#wasThisHelpful","R2BAGJNDQIXM7I","A4LQ8TMZ943XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4LQ8TMZ943XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then I stumbled across the Solowheel on Amazon, and thought ""that would be cool"" but at nearly $2k, it was way overpriced.

"Whenever I see that 'Accolade' I'm locked in! Mr. Smith gives an extensive list of acknowledgement to all the masters of this sub-genre of the overarching Science Fiction Genre-- and it is a highly distinguished list. Also, having read this exemplary adventure, I must say it does them proud.Landry leads an expedition to a war-ravaged planet where he and his crew must solve a pressing problem for the inhabitants of this unfortunate world: there are no females to continue their species! The characterizations herein, and about All of the beings we meet, is rich and complex. Giving life to various personalities, conflicts & ambitions.Overall the writing style is deliciously descriptive. I was actually taken to the world the author brought to life in a way that is difficult for many writers to achieve. There is something new-is-old-is-new again in some of the concepts Mr. Smith uses, some of the technology, and just the thrill of this kind of space adventure-- and it was wholly welcome.

"And very enjoyable. Our 'ordinary citizen' in this light mystery is Doctorate-in-making candidate Lauren Sarasohn who is forced from the get-go to put on her amateur sleuth hat when the body of a strange young man is found in her office on the Campus of Winthrop College in Connecticut. What proceeds from there is an unfolding series of event-based clues that spell out a mystery far deeper and more sinister than even a dead body could have foretold. Gold, Nazis, Art & Secrets etched in human flesh are a heady enough mix that Lauren will have to traverse paths and trust people she never thought she would be able to again if she is to solve the murders and safeguard her own life.

"Ellie March is ""the unhappiest person, like, ever.""Since she investigates gruesome murders for a living, her job probably has something to do with it. She's quite good at what she does, so good that the men she's in charge of, know it and don't necessarily like it. It's hard being the team leader, especially when:""You're supposed to be perfect. The margin of error in this line of work is slim, at best. Forget the pity party.""But sometimes, she's still not taken seriously by her male colleagues. When they call her ""our own palace princess"" or make snide comments like, ""she's not much to look at, but she seems pretty smart."" She just tries not to let it show that it bothers her because she's sacrificed everything for her work. She's lost touch with her elderly parents after they went into a nursing home. Her ex-husband remarried, and their two daughters resent her for never making time for them. She has very few friends and doesn't have a boyfriend or a significant other. She's completely and utterly alone.And with the grueling type of work that she does, it really gets to her sometimes. She has no one to come home to and cuddle up next to in bed and talk out her problems. She's left to her own resources. She practices tai chi to calm her nerves and methodically cleans her gun every morning, even though she's never had to fire it in the line of duty. In order to function on a day-to-day basis, she compartmentalizes, shutting out all the personal stuff and focusing only on the case at hand. In fact, she enjoys the silence her life provides because she has the time to sort out all the details of the case in her mind in order to catch the killer as quickly as possible.But Ellie doesn't completely slip under everyone's radar. Her new partner, Kevin Walker, respects her crime-fighting abilities. He's young, and together they're working on his first homicide case. He knows he can learn a lot from her, if he just follows her lead and pays attention to the way that she handles herself. She even encourages him to continually ask questions, and not to make any assumptions, just so he can appear smart in front of his superiors.Kevin even introduces her to his favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurant in town, The Silver Kettle, and that's where Ellie meets Skinny Jimmy, the gourmet chef who's now stuck being a short order cook. Skinny Jimmy rarely acknowledges anyone, and speaks to practically no one. He's a loner just like Ellie, but he takes a shine to her when she comes in with Kevin to pass out some police sketches of the murder suspect. He admires her no-nonsense demeanor and when she becomes a frequent customer, he has her Christmas dinner delivered to her door before a blizzard hits with detailed, handwritten instructions on how to serve it. When Kevin finds out about Skinny Jimmy's thoughtfulness, he's impressed since not people receive such one-on-one attention from him. Ellie broke through his shell.Ellie's dedicated, and the people around her come to appreciate that. She wanted to be in law enforcement ever since her parents' shoe store was robbed when she was eleven years old. She felt terrified and helpless then, and she never wanted to feel that way again.Sure, she may often hear, ""never send a girl to do a man's job,"" but she doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. She gets up every morning and enjoys being a free agent, unencumbered to do what she does bestnailing the bad guys to the wall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YZT3G2VV8LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZBQ6XE#wasThisHelpful","R21YZT3G2VV8LP","A4LQ8TMZ943XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4LQ8TMZ943XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of my favorite genres-- and when practiced very well as with Mr. Longward's series, it is the Best.This time period is the beginning of the lost set-up, the long decline and fall of the Roman Empire and the role the Germanic people will play in it. It is drawn out like a breath, not quite a sigh-- this was a violent time, so more like the gurgling of blood in a throat. We have numerous sources for the time, yet archaeological evidence can be scant so it is a time of some mystery of just how the relations between the Germanic tribes and the Romans worked out.And thus fiction is our friend here and not just our entertainment. Our narrator Hraben of course is torn between his people, and working and fighting and bleeding from within the Roman palisade, as it were. With much to balance, not only personally, but professionally as alliances and balances of power shift, not just on maps between opposing forces, but within the imperial government-- he is at constant risk of losing something-- be it  his charge, his allegiances, that which is most personal (like his daughter and vengeance against enemies), or his life.This tale takes us all across the ancient landscape pocked by war and the inevitable revolutions of history and I couldn't ask for a finer guide than the author's Hero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCR9ENSZTGFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CCDJO8#wasThisHelpful","R3TCR9ENSZTGFX","A4LQ8TMZ943XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4LQ8TMZ943XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd love to introduce you to Eve Appel, but I think she'd do a much better job introducing herself.""I find chasing down killers more exciting than selling fashionable used clothing.""""Crying is not something I often give into; I'm more of a 'turn your troubles into anger and blame someone else' gal.""""Nobody ever accused me of having generous thoughts about those I don't like.""In A SPORTING MURDER, Eve is often described as insensitive, a bully, and immune to the needs of others whenever she wants her way. Not exactly the most flattering traits one usually associates with a main character, but Eve's sense of humor redeems her in more ways than one.""There's no worse romance spoiler than peanut butter breath.""""How many killings can one sassy gal stumble into?""""There's nothing like work to take your mind off murder. Well, there are other things too. Like sex, food, dancing""She can be a tad self-absorbed, but her best friend and business partner, Madeleine, is the selfless balm to her constant dose of assertiveness. They run a consignment clothing shop together, but aggressive just isn't Madeleine's style. She's a petite redhead to Eve's tall, sexy blond. She worries about the money while Eve always assumes that thinks will work out. Madeleine is clumsy and naive, but she holds fast to her principles, refusing to let Eve talk her into asking a mob boss for a small business loan they so desperately need.But when Madeleine's boyfriend, David, is convicted of first-degree murder, Eve tries to protect her from all of the ugly details related to the case. But this only angers Madeleine more when she feels that Eve doesn't think she can handle the truth, that she's too much of a wimp. Eve tries to help Madeleine by investigating what clues they do have, but she feels guilty leaving her BFF out of the loop.""I should be a better friend to her instead of running all over, trying to play the tough little sleuth.""Alex, Eve's PI boyfriend, couldn't agree more. But Eve hates seeing others in action while she's forced to sit on the sidelines. Even when for the most part her plans never work out, she still dives in, headfirst. She thinks chasing clues will bring her and Alex closer together as a couple, but it really doesn't. Instead, she quickly turns into a problem for him, getting in the way, and endangering herself in the process.""He wanted me to stay out of this murder investigation/possible abduction more than he wanted me naked between the sheets. Well, he couldn't have it both ways.""And that's when things start to get complicated, because there's another man, waiting in the wings, ready to take Alex's place.Sammy is a Miccosukee Indian with dark skin and long black hair. He looks like a warrior. Eve readily admits, ""I liked Sammy's understated handsome looks and rugged style."" When she takes off with him to investigate and doesn't come back until morning, she knows she's in a heap of trouble.""Alone with a handsome Indian. Talking? Who would believe that?""Namely, Madeleine.Eve knows she can con her into not telling Alex that she was out all night with Sammy, even though their friendship is already pretty strained.""I waited for her anger to pass. It did. It always did between us. Nothing, but nothing could sever our bond.""But Eve's secrets soon catch up with her, putting both of their lives in danger.

"Bulimia is a disease often associated with teenage girls, but for Johnnie Kitchen it's something she's been struggling with almost her entire life.Growing up, the temptation to binge and purge constantly surrounded her since the grandmother who raised her bakes mouth-watering cakes for a living. Now her son mocks her, trivializing what she's going through. Even her husband who pays for her treatment wants to know why she's not better yet.But Johnnie knows:""Even when you think you've won the battle, you can never let your guard down.""Because the cause isn't physical, it's psychological.Her mother took off when she was eight when the problems at home became too hard to bear, and Johnnie ended up blaming herself for the reason she disappeared. While her friends' moms get all dolled up to drop their daughters off at ballet and tap, Johnnie's mom was off God knows where turning tricks for a living. Her mom didn't even keep a baby book about her. All she knew about her birthday was that it fell in 1964 somewhere between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Later when she looked up her birth certificate online, she found her paternity simply listed as ""father unknown.""""I spewed you out, Mama, along with gallons of ice cream, bags of potato chips, leftovers I'd rescued from the back of the fridge. Cast you out like a bad demon. All your excuses, all the times you left me high and dry.""The harsh reality that a bulimic faces is unflinchingly portrayed. From shoving the bristles of a toothbrush too far down her throat in order to make herself gag to getting caught by her husband scarfing down an entire skillet full of hamburger meat, a bulimic's shame and humiliation are ever apparent.And the disorder continues to follow Johnnie through all stages of her life.At eight, she is pudgy and unsure of herself, hiding under a winter coat to pretend to be thin. As a teenager, she's a lonely girl who just wants to shed fifteen pounds in order to have a boyfriend. In early adulthood, Johnnie looks at someone like the singer Karen Carpenter and how she died of anorexia and wonders:""If someone rich and famous can get sick how can a nineteen-year-old college girl get well?""It's only when after she gets married and her husband takes an interest in her condition that she starts to make strides in her recovery. For years, she never understood why she does what she does, choosing to view it as a dark, evil thing taking over her body.But as she reaches middle age, she has a breakthrough as she starts to grasp the foundation of her illness.""When I binged, I stuffed all emotions down, not just food. And when I threw up, anger and rage spewed out, too. For years, I internalized these normal human feelingsand I acted them out through bulimia.""After going back to college in her forties, she meets another woman suffering with bulimia in one of her classes. Her teeth are rotten from constant vomiting. Her eyes are bloodshot and her face sallow. She asks Johnnie for the magic pill, telling her how to quit. But Johnnie explains, it's not that easy. It's only going to work if she wants to stop bad enough. There's no other way around it.It's a fitting message to bulimic women out there who might be reading this bookwho are just as desperate to make a change, but don't know how. Johnnie's story shows them to never give up, living a healthy life with this disease can be done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DRPLD80RE9PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6J3DE8#wasThisHelpful","R2DRPLD80RE9PV","A4LQ8TMZ943XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4LQ8TMZ943XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"And effort pays off. So does listening! The author's take on business growth & building covers all stages, but does require some basic, ground-level recognition of where you are and where you want your business to go. Is it a new or young business, or a more mature entity? These are crucial identifiers, as your strategy for marketing will need to play off these to a degree.As well, the author encourages us to adopt the proper mindset to position us for success. This is fundamental: a winning attitude leads to winning. Whereas, if you have the opposite outlook, you will reap negative rewards. Adopting a plan on the how & where to go with your business, again, can be engaged in with knowledge so one isn't traveling blind.The marketing pointers in this book are the treasure --its gems-- and key to the guide for your future endeavors as you seek to maximize your business's success.We get the do's & don'ts, and often you need to see what can happen adversely, in order to fully recognize the positive approaches. Many of these are simply businesses failing to listen properly, or to accept wholly testing results, or not diversifying, and etc.. Mostly due to inward-thinking, myopic viewing, and frankly laziness.On the positive side of the ledger is where Ann Carden makes her bread and butter, and can best be illustrated by teaching a business owner and management team how to plan ahead and to cover all bases. And much of this is how to listen to your customers or prospective customers, and how to implement the various feedback and indicators you are receiving from them and then crafting plans, strategies & tactics to deliver for them.This is a terrific approach & a must-read for any business regardless of size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5SYOK86WYED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514613980#wasThisHelpful","RD5SYOK86WYED","A4LQ8TMZ943XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4LQ8TMZ943XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even before there is a 'relationship'. Communication is the key, from there we must take steps to achieve 'active listening' in order to put (and keep) any relationship on a good footing. But you have to get there, first.Signals given and received, who are the chasers and the chased; think of the ideal partner you seek, Femi tells us, then act accordingly.

I daresay the woman of the house could benefit from a read-thru of this as well to get a better handle on where their partner is coming from (in case they don't know yet ~Heh;)We get from Mr. Jones the real nuts & bolts of relationships. Put plainly and carefully-- this talk he has with the reader doesn't need make-up, just honesty. Here is where we're going: the author tells us our 'lady friend' at some point is going to be offered by another man: what do we do? Communication & trust, keeping things fresh romantically & just otherwise by not getting in a routine... In addition to what a man should know about himself; how about what he needs to know about his lady? Don't be clueless, she won't appreciate it.The terrific advice goes on -- the 'do's & don''s' --and these really do exist and they are very serious... So PAY ATTENTION. How to pick up the strained strands of the relationship after a fight, and just the ultimate/unavoidableness of change: which is just life.

We were fortunate enough to get some great advice from someone we trusted which ultimately led us to this fine dining table set that allowed us to close on it. Couldn't be happier!Some of the things we had to look for, questions asked & answered:--How big a dining set did we need? Tough one, how big was our family? How much extended family did we normally host? And how often did we throw parties for friends, or work-related get-togethers? (So it needed to look quite nice for the all important appearances impression).--In other words, how big the table, but just as importantly: how many chairs? We ultimately came to understand that we were in the market for something more in the dinette set range... therefor more Brady Bunch, than Cheaper by the Dozen.The dining chairs are super comfy, and all 7 pieces are well made & sturdy.

"I LOVE THIS.  I compared side by side to Kindle paperwhite.  Its smaller.  The words are crisper (with older age eyes that helps).  It is a whiteish background rather than the yellowish.What I really love is the glass cover (or whatever material).  It is smooth and there is no decreased bevel.  It is smooth all the way across.  And when you touch it, your fingers feel that it is as smooth as glass.I am still getting used to page turns on the side of the device and sometimes just do it on the screen.  But overall, I love the page turns on the side--i just have to get use to the fact that the lower ones always advance forward (my brain wants to make the lower left one go back a page).  Turns out I am a slow learning on this but I know i will catch on.I love the autodimming feature.  I found manually dimming the paperwhite aggravating.  It also refreshes faster than the paperwhiteAND, I take notes in the books and when using the keyboard--this one can keep up with my speed much better than paperwhite.  which couldn't keep up with me at all.  It was very frustrating.The Origami CASE is a must.  And the biggest reason i liked this vs the paperwhite.  Don't get this confused.  This is a much, much better device than the paperwhite.  But I wouldn't have spent the extra money if it weren't for the wonderful case and its abilty to stand up on its own as well as how much smaller it is.  With the paperwhite it is considerably bigger in the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZV3CMRSBGC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOY8XWQ#wasThisHelpful","R34ZV3CMRSBGC2","A5Q1FK0FWU7DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Q1FK0FWU7DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THIS is the reason I bought the voyage (well, and the voyage had a couple of nice features I liked as well)..  This is a very thin case.  It is beautiful.  The inside is soft, unlike the one for the paperwhite (i have sensory issues and hated touching the amazon case on the paperwhite).  But the best feature is being able to have it stand on its own while I read.  Don't think you will use that much???  Well, you might be surprised.  I read at least twice as much now that i can read while eating.  Ok,  maybe not twice as much.  But, even when on my bed, i use the stand--so I use the stand almost all the time.I LOVE THIS.

"This is a great little speaker.  Because I do not have a line in for my cell phone in my car, i use this.  it can charge via USB and it pairs up with my phone's bluetooth.  The speaker isn't overly loud but loud enough.  It is meant as a small portable device, not a home stereo system.  I can also take with me to hotels when I travel.  Or camping.  Or on a picnic.  I love it.  I love that it is attractive also.  Carrying case is included to help protect it when you are taking it places.Update:  I have used this in my car over the last month and it is awesome.  I just have to remember to power it off--and sometimes I remember and sometimes I do not.  But the sound is great--I listen to my iphone through its speaker and it is a bold sound that is loud enough to drown out car noise so that I can hear my audible books with ease and no strain.  I actually have been using it in the car on every trip and just keep it plugged into the charger in my car.  I'm very pleased with this unit and would recommend to anyone who doesn't have a bluetooth built in radio in their car but wants  to listen to something from their phone (music, audible) .Highly recommend","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPT00EYB6GVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVV140K#wasThisHelpful","R2GPT00EYB6GVC","A5Q1FK0FWU7DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Q1FK0FWU7DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Robin accepts an invitation to one of August's exciting and well-known parties that are meant for the most exclusive clique at Callabrese High School, she has no idea what she's in for.  This year's scavenger hunt is going to be over-the-top for sure. It's not long before all of Robin's friends are turning up dead. Who would ever want to do this? Could it be the popular host, August or is it someone that may have something in for him or maybe even one of the other party goers?  What seemed like a meant for fun scavenger hunt has turned into anything but fun and how will Robin get out without becoming a casualty herself?I really loved ""The Rules"" by Nancy Holder. She did an amazing job telling the story from the different character's perspectives. Each chapter started with a rule that a certain character follows within their daily life and how it comes into play with the story. I thought this was really unique and made it easy to follow.This is what I call a ""One More Chapter Book"" -- one that I keep putting off stopping long after my bedtime. From page one I was hooked and on the edge of my seat. The twists and turns were done in way that made me *think* I knew who it was.  Then I'd find out I wasn't as good at this as I thought.  So scared, and frantically reading, listening to the sounds my house makes at night, I stayed up until the very early morning turning pages until the book ended.This one is perfect for a late summer night read (any season really). Especially if you're into the horror/slasher type movies. Which, I'd like to mention would make a fantastic movie.  I would absolutely recommend ""The Rules"". This one is for those of you that also love their ""One More Chapter Books"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJ75A3F8E9WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385741006#wasThisHelpful","R2JJ75A3F8E9WM","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life changed for Frances Mace and her family while taking a luxury cruise. She found love and lost it for the very same reason. When she would finally be rescued, Frances would also lose her identity. If there's anyone that should be out for revenge, it's Frances Mace.The Daughter of Deep Silence does not disappoint. I think that there's so much in this novel; a little something for just about everyone's reading tastes.  Carrie Ryan does has done an amazing job with the writing of this book.  I was sucked in by the story from page one and it didn't let go until the end.  I was reading so quickly to find out what was going to happen next. I needed to slow my pace because as much as I wanted to find out exactly what was going to happen, I wasn't done spending time with the characters in this book.Frances is one of four people that survive a vicious attack on the Persephone.  By the time she's rescued by her friend Libby's father, there are only three people left to tell the tale of what happened that night. One of them was Grey, the boy she fell I love with on the cruise.  The second was his father, Senator Wells. The last survivor was Frances, herself. Why were the Senator and Grey lying about what happened on the luxuryYacht?  It was suggested by Libby's father that she take over Libby's identity so that he could protect her.  She was now all alone and so she agreed.While transitioning from Frances to Libby, she had to say goodbye to the only life she ever knew and take over Libby's life. For four years, Frances/Libby is prepared to do what she has to to get revenge on anyone and everyone that ruined her life, took away her family and friends, and demolished all she knew.I loved that Frances was such a strong heroine.  The statement that I thought described her best was -- just how far would one girl go when she thinks she has nothing left to lose!  There are so many quotes that are highlighted in my book. I want to tell you all of the parts of the story I went back to read a second time.  I highly recommend Daughter of Deep Silence by Carrie Ryan. Add it to your summer reading list. It's a suspenseful, revenge story that's utterly unique.  If Carrie Ryan is a new author for you, you're in for a treat. She has written so many fantastic books. If you've read her before, you already know to hold on.  You're in for a ride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV1VWECGXLHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426507#wasThisHelpful","RGV1VWECGXLHB","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don't believe in magic, you will after reading Circus Mirandus by Cassie Beasley.  Circus Mirandus is about Micha Tuttle who has been living with his Grandpa Ephraim ever since his parents passed away.  Micha and his Grandpa have a very special bond and love each other fully and deeply.Grandpa Ephraim tells Micha stories about the great Circus Mirandus, The Man Who Bends Light, and all of it's magic. Micha believes in all of the stories his Grandpa tells him. He would like to go himself but Grandpa is now very ill and Great-Aunt Gertrudis has moved in to help. One thing Great-Aunt Gertrudis will not help with is Micha believing in the stories that Grandpa tells him. She doesn't approve at all.When Grandpa Ephraim does offer proof to Micha, he can hardly wait to get started on his journey. Grandpa tells him that The Man Who Bends Light owes him a miracle. One that was promised to him long ago when he was just a boy. So when the Circus Mirandus rolls into town, Micha and his friend Jenny (who isn't one who believes in magic) set out to find the Lightbender to get him to give Grandpa his miracle and make him well.Micha and Jenny have the best time at the circus. I truly fell in love with all of the characters and the descriptions in this book. Author Cassie Beasley has done an amazing job with Circus Mirandus.  It's well-written and the story flows beautifully.  I absolutely fell in love with Circus Mirandus.  I'm even going to say that this is probably the best children's book I've read all year. I would love to see this be made into a movie.  This is the perfect book for your children's summer reading list (and the young-at-heart). I know Circus Mirandus is a keeper for our bookshelf.  I highly recommend that you take a little time to spend with Micha and believe in magic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RS4WQYD11KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428437#wasThisHelpful","R3RS4WQYD11KT","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought Flirty Aprons Women's Sultry Apron in  Lovely Lace is one adorable apron.  It was liked even more by the Mister than me. It's silky, sassy and will definitely raise the temperature in the kitchen before you even turn on the oven!This is a costume-type apron that has many features that I thought were cute!*  At the bottom of the blue skirt and top of the halter there's a sweet ruffle hem*  The heart-shaped lace top is flattering and fun*  It has adjustable strapsIs it perfect or practical for making dinner in?  Obviously not.  I think that it's easy to see that it's simply not made to be functional, but it will bring a little bit of flirtation to the kitchen.

"Joe gets a letter from Grandpa asking how his summer is going and hopes he'll hear about everything he's learned  when they meet for their special trip.Joe sends grandpa a letter back telling him all about just how ""delicious summer"" has been!  But assures him that he hasn't stopped learning or forgot about school during his vacation.  Joe tells him just how busy he's been and the reader sees just how busy he's been through all of the adorable pictures.  He's building ice cream sand castles, reading every day, and learning new words.  The younger set that this book is focused for is sure to learn some new words themselves, like ""conquering"", ""equation"", and  ""cartography"".  Joe assures his grandfather that he's busy with math equations, reading the encyclopedias he gave him and learning some History.  All of the things that Joe learns about or does is ice cream related in his mind.  He goes to the beach, summer camp, and on field trips.  He's sure to prove to grandpa that he definitely deserves the special vacation he's planning.There are so many ice cream facts that are located within the pictures.  You learn who made ice cream, how it is made, and even some of the important people that love ice cream almost as much as Joe does!  The facts are done in such a way that my little one's didn't even know they were learning these facts.  It's also become a recent favorite on our bedtime reading shelf.Peter Sis will show you one little boy who loves ice cream and teach you a few facts you probably didn't know.  The beautiful watercolor drawings made me think summer and all of the fun and relaxing things that come with it.  If only we could have that weather here in New England all year round.

"Cassidy is an eleven year old girl who lives to prank and be a tomboy! She can't wait to play with her best friend, Jack. They can hang out, fish, and have the very best summer vacation ever!But all that comes to a quick halt when she's ""gifted"" a summer stuck in etiquette school in the will of her late great-grandmother.  What is she going to do now? All she wants to do is follow her dream of being a ""Knight of the Road"" and she certainly doesn't need proper etiquette for that! Right?  Cassidy is also noticing Jack doesn't seem to be interested in their usual fun and games. Not even their pranks!  He seems to be more interested in the new neighbor who is a teenage girl and the exact opposite of Cassidy.I thought Cassidy's Guide to Everyday Etiquette would be one story that would be a winner for me. Unfortunately, I liked it, laughed more than a few times, but I thought it was a middle grade story that had potential that never really shined. And while Cassidy may find herself with a little more etiquette, it comes a little too late without enough laughs for even the younger set. I think this one would be better borrowed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TUX2HFPX0MZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375830979#wasThisHelpful","R2TUX2HFPX0MZO","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since I was young, I've had a slight incontinence problem that only got worse after having cancer twice and a few major surgeries.  I've tried all different kinds of incontinence panties. (ie Depend, Depend Silhouette, Tena, and Always).  My favorite have always been the Depends Silhouette Brand.  I used to wear the Depends Silhouette Maximum Strength all the time.  They have so many amazing details that still make me feel confident and beautiful.  I say this because I'm younger and sometimes I like to wear a something special and not have to worry about looking like I'm wearing a diaper.  The New Depend Underwear Silhouette Active Fit has all the things I love about the maximum strength panties but for daytime, they have even more things to love.At night, I still stick with the Depends Underwear Silhouette Maximum Strength just in case.  But now during the day, I have another choice to help me personally.  I am a tiny woman and I am only about 4'11"" tall and approximately 100 pounds.  I wear the small/medium fit in any of the depends products and they fit perfectly.  Why do I love these?  It's so easy.*  They are made of a cotton-type fabric*  The look and feel just like cotton panties*  While I usually can only find beige in the Maximum Strength, these also come in black*  These are stretchy and fit snug so that you can wear your slinky maxi dress or jeans!*  The Depend Active Fit has a much lower rise than the regular Depend Silhouette Underwear*  They are super thin and comfortable*  Available in moderate absorbency*  The comfortable fit leaves you feeling confident no matter what you choose to wear*  Easy pull apart seams on either side just like the full maximum absorbency.I use the Depend Underwear Silhouette Active Fit strictly for my daytime use.  They keep me feeling confident that there will not be any kind of leak and the stretchy, snug fit is perfect for anything you want to wear.  You can't tell that these are incontinence panties under anything you choose to wear.  At night, I am confident in using the Depend Underwear Silhouette Maximum Strength.  I have grown to trust the Depend name over the years and their products keep getting better and better.I highly recommend the Depend Underwear Silhouette Active Fit (in black or beige) for the woman on the go who has a slight bladder problem and likes to stay active.  You can go dancing in your favorite dress, go to the gym, and do just about any activity that you can think of and love without there being a single problem.  Depend Silhouette's is my favorite brand and I just know you'll love them just as much as I do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368F99NEUDV5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U16LTP8#wasThisHelpful","R368F99NEUDV5Z","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to note that I got these for my oldest son who goes golfing with his friends three to four times a week.  Callaway is a brand that he has grown to know and love and they are definitely his favorite brand.He's owned these shoes close to a month and is a size 12.  They are comfortable, light and run true to size.  The look of the Del Mar Zephyr by Callaway is quite stylish but despite the like sneaker--type look, they're very durable.When he first saw them, he thought that they made need a separate insole for comfort.  But after trying them on, he was surprised at how comfortable the Ortholite 3D insole was.  After playing about twelve rounds of golf, he still talks about how comfortable and light the Callaway Del Mar Zephyr's are.The Del Mar Zephyr by Callaway does not have a spiked sole.  The sole is rubber with some raised areas for traction.  I know my son plays in the mornings on occasion and hasn't complained about his socks getting wet.  I can't comment on total wetness or pouring rain because I haven't seen him go out to play in these conditions.  Especially as of late.The final verdict on the Callaway Del Maar Zephyr is that they are an absolute keeper!  My son loves his and from course to clubhouse, he wears these time and time again.  He's even bought a couple of different colors to wear since he received these.  It's the lightness of the shoe mixed with support and comfort that make them unbeatable!  Highly recommended to anyone that loves to play golf.  Wether you're a seasoned golfer or a novice, you'll love and appreciate the design and style right out of the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4GNCT8HHZCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDNQH7O#wasThisHelpful","RB4GNCT8HHZCA","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that the nice, warm weather is here in New England and we've gotten rid of all of the snow, a day hike/picnic is just what we needed after being cooped up inside and doing activities that are indoor related due to weather.There is nothing worse for me than carrying a heavy pack.  I am a petite 4'11"" and 100 pounds.  Anything too heavy makes me want to pack it up early and/ or have someone else carry my pack.  We have a Thule Bike Rack and I have been really excited to try some of their other items.  The bike rack is made well and has quality written all over it.  We haven't had a single problem with the rack.This is a light backpack that is meant to fit a woman's frame.  It's easily adjustable and comfortable to wear.  The Capstone 32 L Hiking Pack features it's MicroAdjust Suspension System that will let me adjust the torso length by 4"" to get the perfect fit.,  The shoulder harness, torso, and hip belt system is specific to a woman's body structure.I love the built in rain cover that allows you to continue hiking without ruining the contents of the bag if a rain shower comes along.  There are also more storage spaces in this pack than you could ever need or want.  The top zippered pouch lets you hold things that you don't want to fall out but may need more often than some of the other things packed. It's suggested to hold your essentials. I used this for my water bottle and sunscreen.  There are also two hip belt pockets that are perfect for a cell phone or maybe a snack.  Finally you'll find a stretch fabric ""shove-it"" pocket that Thule suggests you put your gear that you'll need most often.I absolutely love my new Thule Women's capstone Hiking Pack (32 Liter, Jewel/Potion)!  After using this pack twice, I have yet to find anything that I do not like about the pack and if I do you'll be sure to see it right here updated at the bottom of my review!  It's an amazing pack and extremely light and comfortable.

"I absolutely agree that there are not enough books about WWII (or World War One for that matter) aimed at younger children. I thought that the Battle of the Bulge did a thorough job on some parts, maybe a little too thorough for ages 8-12 and then I thought other parts seemed scattered. As much as I'd like to have more history and non-fiction books for younger children, I don't think this one hits the mark.I found it too heavy and complicated for most children in even the higher of the age range. The Battle of the Bulge could possibly help as reference to a school report with the help of a parent or teacher but I just don't see this as leisure reading for even the youngest history buffs. The pictures and maps that are in this book may help set off the rich reading content for the younger set; I'm even unsure about that.There is no doubt that as an adult writer Rick Atkinson knows the subject he covers and turns out well-written books. For children, I don't agree that just taking pieces of his writing or even one portion of the war and adding smaller chapters, photographs and maps will make for understandable, easy literature for grammar school aged children.I found this book hard to follow.  What I found even harder were some of the questions that came from my little one.  I could tell he was confused by the look on his face.  This one was just not a win for us as a children's book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HHGP8AVMMH2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791132#wasThisHelpful","R3HHGP8AVMMH2Z","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I was recovering from surgery this year, I watched the first to seasons of Moone Boy on Hulu with my real friend. I actually found Martin and his awesome imaginary friend Sean (who is played by played by co-writer and star of the show Chris O'Dowd) extremely funny and the first person I thought of was my oldest son. Not because he reminds me of either one of them, but because I thought he'd enjoy it too. Now my oldest son is above the middle school years so I wasn't concerned with the cursing or fighting or bullying.  This is not because I don't care but I know he's old enough to understand right from wrong.  I was right, he did find it funny and watched the two seasons as well. I'm also going to go ahead and say that I liked the BBC TV show more than I enjoyed the book. This is a rarity.  I'm normally a book over TV/movie person by far.  But here's why...The story has ""footnotes"" on almost every page. It really takes you out of the story and what's going on with Martin and Sean. You can try to wait to read the footnote until the end of each page or wherever they may pop-up, but you'll more than likely have to read it because they are mainly terms or things used in Ireland or Europe in general. I found those really annoying. I just didn't like the way the book was set up. I can only imagine how a pre-teen boy that may or may not be a reluctant reader would feel about this. However, if they can get past that, boys are going to be the main audience for this book. There is a lot of gross humor and the story does play up just how horrible sisters can be.  But being a sister to myself to a brother, I think they can definitely do their own share of damage in the stages while we grow up. It's simple sibling rivalry.  One day you're the best of friends and the next day you won't sit together in the same room with each other. Those of us that have siblings understand. Martin IS the only boy in the house.I found the television show to just flow better. I am even proof that more than middle grade boys can find this story humorous.  I think you definitely get much more of the humor when you see it being acted out. Especially when they show Sean in both his invisible friend state and visible state (to Martin only) while others look on. I think it's a very cute idea and it's not unbelievable for Martin to go looking for a male imaginary friend to help him through his daily adventures.  His for real friend is busy working the family farm for the summer.I thought I'd love the book because I liked the TV Show. I thought it was okay and I even laughed out loud through some of it. But I have to hold my ground and go with the TV Show over the book. I also think it's a little long and takes quite a while to get into the story for the average pre-teen boy.  It's just slow throughout the book with scattered funny parts.  I was really sad this wasn't a five star love for me.  But I would say that if you get a chance to watch the TV Show to definitely give it a try. It's worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTO4P91T49YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057078#wasThisHelpful","RVTO4P91T49YN","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My little one loved book 1 in the TombQuest Series. So it was a given that Amulet Keepers, TombQuest Book 2 was on our reading list! This story has Alex and Ren off to London where people are missing, graves are being opened, and blood red rain is flowing through the streets. After a little research, Alex decides that they should look into the Highgate Cemetery where they find that an ancient Egyptian evil creature is behind all of the mystery going on.The Death Walker, who will suck your soul is very dangerous. In this book, we still loved Alex and Ren.  The Egyptian feel was a fun and fast-paced setting as well. The Amulet Keepers is an action packed book that kept my little one wanting me to read ""just a little bit more"" every time I tried to stop!  This is definitely one series we'll continue to follow.Some children may be interested in the computerized game that goes along with the book. I think it's a really creative feature.

"Marjorie Trumaine has gone through so much over the past few years.  She and her husband Hank used to run their farm together in North Dakota.  But Hark has had a very serious accident leaving him almost completely paralyzed and blind. Marjorie now cares for her husband and the farm with the help of her neighbors and friends. Marjorie is an avid reader and was able to take a class that now has her employed as an indexer. This keeps their bills paid and food on their table.One day when Sheriff Hilo Jenkins comes to the door and it isn't to have a visit with his close friend Hank, Marjorie is puzzled. Sheriff Jenkins informs her that their neighbor's Mr. and Mrs. Knudson have been murdered and an amulet was found clutched in Mr. Erik Knudson's hand. Sheriff Hilo Jenkins quietly asks Marjorie to help him investigate this amulet and find out as much about it as she possibly can.Because of her husband's close friendship with the sheriff and her worry of the murder being so close, she agrees to find out all she can.  But when she starts to feel like she's being watched, and more murders occur, she becomes more determined to help solve this mystery. What can these amulets mean? Who is killing the good people of their small town and why?Author Larry Sweazy had me up late two nights in row lost in his beautifully written mystery.  His writing made me feel like I was right there with Marjorie. I was thrilled with the twists and turns that were taken. It also made me realize what it was like to solve a murder and to take care of her ill husband without all of the new gadgets that we have today.

"Stephen is forced to move away to his father's hometown of Spencer.  Having spent all of their money on his mom's medical bills and his father losing his job; they move in with his grandmother who never shows emotion and likes to keep everything tidy. Besides the move with his father, Stephen's mom in an Asylum because she's been seeing things and is a danger not only to herself, but others. Stephen isn't expecting the best summer.It isn't long before Stephen meets Cara and her thin brother Devon. Devon and his friends' hang out every night at the play ground. Which is actually the cemetery.  It's here where they meet and drink. I thought all of the characters were very well-written. They all spoke and acted like teenage children. Stephen was especially well-written. Spencer is a town that has their own superstitions and folk law about ""the winged ones"" who show up during dark and dangerous times.  The only way to bring good times back to the town is to keep ""the winged ones"" happy by having a sacrifice.  Or so everyone believes. Stephen finds comfort in Cara. He also happens to think she's hot. Devon's got to be a great friend, right? He invited Stephen to hang out at the cemetery with his friends when he didn't have to.But Stephen just wants to fit in. He wants to have new friends. But when Cara and Devon turn out to be anything but who Stephen thinks they are, he doesn't know what to do or what to believe.  Heather Brewer turns up the creepiness, mystery, and darkness throughout the entire story. I loved The Cemetery Boys!  It grabs you at page one and doesn't let go until the book has ended. And what an ending it is! I highly recommend The Cemetery Boys to anyone that likes a fantastic coming of age story mixed with suspense, twists, and turns!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYPSUD5P66RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062307886#wasThisHelpful","RYYPSUD5P66RI","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the beginning of Velvet, Caitlin's mother has just passed away from being ill. Because her father passed away quite a while ago, Caitlin is forced to move in with her aunt, uncle, and cousin she hardly knows.  I chose to read Velvet because I had taken a long break from vampire novels for a while. I took a chance, and I have to admit that I'm glad I did.Caitlin's neighbor Adrian has been keeping an eye on her. He's her bodyguard because she has a daemon after her. What better way to protect Caitlin than to pretend he's her boyfriend. But because Adrian is also a Vampire, he can't be in love with a human. Caitlin's pretend feelings definitely turn into real feelings.  Soon they're inseparable.The character's in this story made it a fun, fast read.  Their thoughts and things they said were funny and sweet.  Caitlin and Adrian made a very cute couple.  I also loved Caitlin's friend Kelly. The story was well-written and seemed to go by very quickly.  The ending is a cliffhanger and if you want to find out what's next, there's always that dreaded wait.

"The Secrets We Keep by Trisha Leaver is a hauntingly beautiful. Two identical twin sisters Ella and Maddy love each other and are very close but they couldn't be more different. Maddy is the outgoing popular one with tons of friends and always looking for a way to be in the spotlight.  Ella is the quiet one with few friends and her favorite sketchbook. If anyone has ever been in her sister's shadow, it's Ella.One fateful night when Ella is driving Maddy's car, they get into a tragic car accident and one of twins dies and one of the twin's live.  When Ella wakes up in the hospital and everyone thinks she's Maddy, Ella decides to live her sister's life. I think mainly because she believes everyone loves Maddy while no one hardly ever notices Ella. So how could she be missed?  She takes on her sister's persona for her family and Maddy's friends.As the months go on, Ella learns many secrets that her sister has kept her sheltered from. There are amazing twists and turns that kept me turning pages way after my bedtime!  I thought about Maddy, Ella, and their story long after finishing the book.

"Material Girls by Elaine Dimopoulos was marketed as a dystopian type of ""Divergent"" mixed with ""Project Runway"".  I loved the Divergent series and I'm a total fashion lover.  So for me, I thought this would be something I'd absolutely love!  I liked it and the premise was interesting, but I couldn't really see what I'd call a ""Divergent"" type of story.What's interesting is that thirteen year olds await their ""Tap"". This is wether they'll stay in school for the lesser wanted jobs aka ""adequates"" or the more desired jobs where the teens control fashion, become judges on the court of what becomes popular, and of course super pop stardom.Marla has always had an eye for fashion and sits as a Judge of the court to decide what items become popular. She's received much praise and many accolades during her time on the Court. That is until some of the other judges start to disagree with what drafts Marla thinks will be popular. She's then demoted to the basement where she then has to start drafting fashion.Ivy is a super hot pop star.  Everything in her life is scripted. But when she steps out, what she's wearing is immediately popular. Ivy is a diva in every way and knows that most would have to struggle to wear the things she does. When Marla and Ivy meet, they start to talk about overthrowing all that they've ever known. Marla and some of the other drafters are planning on bringing back or recycling some of the older looks to make new looks and Ivy is going to wear them to make these clothes ultra popular.Loving fashion the way I do, I found this read to be fast and fun. But there was a lot missing with the background of ""the government"" and even the world that they lived in. I think Material Girls will have a certain following, but because the world and background are not really explained; it certainly will not be for everyone. If you're a fashionista, I'd recommend you give it a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRK1XO5NP1V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054438850X#wasThisHelpful","R1IRK1XO5NP1V8","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Disappearance of Emily H. is one of the cutest books I've read in a while.  Raine and her mother move to a new town when her grandmother dies. Raine lived with her grandmother until she was six.  Raine's grandmother could see hints of a living memory reading ""sparkles"".  Raine has the very same power.  She learns by reading the ""sparkles"" in her home that a girl named Emily Huvar is missing.When Raine goes to sign up for school, she meets a young girl that's right out of home-schooling named Shirlee. Shirlee and Raine are both being bullied by the mean girls - mainly Jennifer. The  two girls decide to use Jennifer's crush on a boy named Michael to get back at her for the way she's been treating them both.  It was very clever of both Raine and Shirlee to think of this (which is probably how a Middle School Child reading this would take it. But me, being an adult, I immediately stopped to wonder if bullying should be fought back with more bullying).All of the characters in this story were written perfectly for middle grade students. I just wanted more for the ending. I loved the story and the ""sparkles"". Those things kept me turning pages to find out what would happen next. I would love to see more of Raine and her power.  I think it could be just what middle school children need.There were a few things within the story that I immediately wondered about.  This is an example, but it's also a spoiler so please do not read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know anything about the story.  Now I'm not one to nit-pick stories for little holes and I almost never post a spoiler. But when a child has been missing, I believe the police would take her cell phone and her laptop.  That way they could monitor what she was doing online or whom she was speaking with. But that was not done. This is just one example. I'm not sure that children would think of this. But I bet parents' would.I loved The Disappearance of Emily H. and would highly recommend it to the young and young-at-heart.  It's a great read with some important messages. Put this on your child's summer reading list!  It was a lot of fun with a hint of paranormal!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R28PDRO607TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385739435#wasThisHelpful","R1R28PDRO607TV","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Invasion of Privacy by Christopher Reich is an amazingly written thriller about all the privacy issues and cyber crimes we face today.  Mary Grant wants answers regarding the death of her FBI Agent, husband Joe. She needs answers not only for herself, but for their two daughters Jesse and Grace that she is now left to raise alone.  It doesn't seem that anyone has answers so Mary just may have to find them out herself.Christopher Reich has written a fast-paced thriller that will keep you turning pages until you reach the very end. I loved the story, the characters, and the haunting reality of the novel itself.  This has to be one of the best thrillers I've read in a while. I went to sleep reading this book and woke up the next morning and picked it up off the nightstand to take with me in the kitchen.This is a really fast read full of action and thrills that just do not stop.

"When I read the blurb of ""The Little Paris Bookshop"", I knew I had to read it. To me, what's not to love about a tiny floating bookstore in France located on a barge in the Seine?

That's right Monsieur Perdu isn't there to just sell the latest best sellers, but he has a knack for matching the right book with the right person.Monsieur Perdu is busy fixing everyone else's life but the one he can't seem to fix is his very own.

"To say The Library at Mount Char is unique would probably be an understatement.  Here we have a man who's supposed to be like God who ""adopts"" twelve children.  They now call him father.  He keeps them living in his library like prisoners. They are each there to master a different skill.  The Library at Mount Char is a fantasy, science fiction book that I found terrifying, dark, and mysterious. It does contain some humor that is pretty much a necessity to break up everything else going on.At the beginning of the book, Father is missing and no one knows where he could be.  It's obvious that if he never comes back, someone new will need to lead them. But who would that be?  I thought that each of the twelve were thinking this but some were taking a more serious approach.  From the first page of this book, I was in disbelief.  I think that's what mainly kept the pages turning for me way past my bedtime.I just had to know what was going to happen next.  This book is just crazy.  Full of many unexpected twists and turns to keep you guessing. I would also like to mention that this book is NOT for the squeamish. It really shocked me in some places.

"At the beginning of last summer I read and finished C. Robert Cargill's Dreams and Shadows. I loved the world building, the fact that Colby won the war of the Limestone Kingdom and ran the fairies out of Texas. I thought Colby went through so much and grew as a character in book one. But with the loss of his best friend, we see a different Colby in Queen of the Dark Things.I have been reading quite a bit of fantasy set in a place most of us would know rather than a totally made up place. I like to see where the author will take a place like Texas and make it his own. This book is full of magic and mystery like the first. But I did feel it drag in some places.  It took me longer than normal to finish this book. I kept putting it down and picking up something else. Then, when I finished that book, I would start again.Colby is depressed and clearly misses his best friend in Queen of the Dark Things. I did enjoy the book, but not as much as the first. I am hoping that book three will give us more on Colby and the many new characters introduced in this book that were there one minute and then seemed to be forgotten about the next.If you read the first book, I would recommend Queen of the Dark Things. That's just how I am. I like to see how a sequel continues on with the first book. I would also recommend this series to anyone who loves fantasy in a modern place. I did like Queen of the Dark Things but it wasn't what I expected.  I will be picking up the next installment because I like to see how everything comes together.  The only time I wouldn't would be if the first book just wasn't for me.

"Memoirs are not my normal choice for reading preference. They can sometimes be drawn out, tell too much or too little, and sometimes never get to the part of that person's life that we really want to know about. Kate Betts' My Paris Dream is a beautifully written memoir. It takes us inside not only the life she worked so hard for, but the heart of fashion.Kate's mother told her to ""Just Go"" that ""she could always come back""!  I found Kate's story one that just about anyone could relate to. We all have our Paris, we all have our dream, and so many times we never get to follow our dreams. One reason or another comes up and we forget about what we really wanted to do or be. Not Kate.She moved to France, rented a room, and learned the language. He first major break was working below John Fairchild at Women's Wear Day and from there she went to Vogue! How exciting to know all of the important designers that were shaping fashion!

"Sisters of Blood and Spirit first drew me in with it's gorgeous cover and blurb. I know, I've heard it before - ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" - but sometimes...it's extremely hard.I really liked this one and am glad I'm stepping out of my comfort zone lately!  A thrilling ghost story that's action packed and has a great plot.  What's not to like? Tie in a smidgen of romance and there you have a nearly perfect YA Novel!Yes, I said nearly. Why? Well, I would love to know more about both Lark and Wren, their famil, and definitely the Shadowlands.  Lark is the ""living twin"" the one that actually took a breath here on earth and wasn't stillborn like her sister Wren. Lark's parent's basically disowned her and sent her to live with her grandparents. She can still see her sister Wren and even talk to her.But after a suicide attempt and the fact mostly everyone at school thinks she's crazy because she still talks to her sister; she feels like she belongs in the shadowlands more than her sister Wren does. The shadowlands is a place Wren goes when she feels she needs to be with the dead.This story is so very well-written and Kady Cross does a fantastic job at keeping the sisters completely opposite with their own voices.Eventually some of the students come to Lark for help (Wren too) with a problem they're having with a ghost themselves. Lark is tough and she has everything she needs to stay strong through anything.I was just surprised at how quickly this novel went by! I can't wait for the next installment and would highly recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVLUP01GYO8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211481#wasThisHelpful","R3NVLUP01GYO8P","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To me, Bounty Basic Paper Towels are absolutely above any other ordinary ""bargain-brand paper towel"".  For the price, they're a great value.  I love the wide variety of sizes and prints that they come in.  You definitely don't get that with many other bargain-brand paper towels.  But my favorite thing about these have to be the option to select-a-size.  You only take what you need.I honestly think these are stronger than any other bargain-brand.  When these get wet, it takes a lot to make them tear.  This way, you're not in the middle of cleaning and end up with torn towel and your hand in a mess.  For bigger spills or for messes the little ones make, I always find myself using extra paper towels just to make sure that everything is cleaned up and left sparkling clean.  That's a ""me"" thing, though.  It's not Bounty's fault I'm OCD when it comes to cleaning.These are a perfect choice for our family.  I find them to be strong and worth every penny.  It looks like I may be in the minority right now with other reviews that are listed.  But, I am only comparing these to other bargain-brand paper towels.  I'm not comparing them to the 2x absorbent or the extra strength paper-towels.  I think if you put them up against any of the others in this category, Bounty will definitely come out on top.  Realistically, unless there is a sale or coupon, I get what I pay for.Over the years, Bounty is a name that I've grown to love and trust.

"Pantene is my favorite drug store shampoo.  I use this Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner with the matching Shampoo and I couldn't be happier with the results!  After having a Brazilian Blowout done to my hair, I have to be careful not to use any products that contain sulfur.  It reverses the straightening process much faster.Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek is a thick and rich conditioner that makes a beautiful lather.  I can actually feel the difference when I use it.  My hair feels softer and looks really shiny even before I use any styling products!  It's perfect for the ends of my hair and isn't so heavy that it weighs my hair down.Even when using my straightening iron or curling wand, my hair remains moisture rich and not dry at all. I find that when I use a better shampoo and conditioner, I lose less hair and it's never dull.  I absolutely love the Pro-V Smooth and Sleek line. It's perfect for keeping my hair straight, shiny and smooth!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B99WPB8UGZO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003USK92S#wasThisHelpful","R1B99WPB8UGZO6","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can find Nick Cannon on television.  He's an actor and an all around entertainer.  My kids know him from Nickelodeon.  Now, you can also find him on the shelf at your nearest bookstore or library.  Just in time for poetry month, Mr. Cannon is putting out his new poetry book out there this April!  Neon Aliens Ate My Homework will help introduce poetry to younger children with a Hip Hop influence.  Nick is obviously proud that these two things have helped make him who he is today.There's a letter and biography of Nick Cannon at the beginning of the book.  Here, he definitely gives props to Shel Silverstein for helping him get into poetry.  I grew up on Shel Silverstein and I loved every book I've ever read that he's had published.  There's even a poem in Neon Aliens Ate My Homework that immediately took me back and reminded me of Shel's poem ""Mrs. McTwitter The Babysitter"".  It was really nice to be brought back to this much simpler time in my life.Nick does talk about all things gross, funny, and sure to make children laugh.  All of the poems are accompanied by amazing art done by six unbelievably talented street artists that you can learn about in each of their biographies in the book.I'm not one that listens to Hip Hop all the time.  Poetry isn't even my favorite genre.  Not even close.  But I did enjoy the time I spent reading Neon Aliens Ate My Homework and I know my children did as well.  It's a quick read and a lot of fun.  We definitely liked it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQKI1IQPQKQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545722810#wasThisHelpful","R2LQKI1IQPQKQY","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me just say that I love cookbooks.  I have been collecting them for years in order to gain experience in the kitchen and to make our meal time different.  We're far from the same old thing every single night. There's nothing worse than having to have the same things all the time because one (or more) of your children only like(s) certain foods.  Now, with that being said, I do understand that this happens, there are allergies, and just some foods that most children don't particularly like.  Unless maybe they're brought up on it.  I was definitely taken by surprise to find that the ""tips and tricks"" in this cookbook to getting children to eat adult foods or maybe a dish that may not be ""kid friendly"" is to simply cut down on the spices or make it a little bland.  I know this simply wouldn't work for my kids and I am not one to make three different things for dinner, lunch or even breakfast!Is this a beautiful cookbook? Yes! It absolutely is! There are bold, colorful pages and it's packed with one hundred recipes.  The problem? You probably won't find many recipes that you'll want to make as a part of your regular meal time.  I didn't, anyway.  This cookbook is definitely not for beginners.  I'll just say they weren't kidding when they titled this ""The Gourmet Dad"".  I feel that I am pretty advanced in the kitchen.  I've cooked for myself and my family for years.  I am always testing my skills with different classes and recipes and I found many of these recipes much too time consuming for the final results.There were a surprising amount of ingredients needed for quite a few of these recipes that I wouldn't just happen to have on hand waiting in my kitchen.  That's a really big problem.  I don't want to have to go hunting for ingredients before making dinner or while prepping.  My children also like to help with dinner and I would be a total liar if I didn't say that this is my favorite part as well.  But, In order for this to happen, the recipes need to be easy to follow.  Another problem was getting them interested in trying out one of the recipes.My final thoughts - I really wanted to love this cookbook and add it to my arsenal of everyday dinners.  To me, it's just not a ""family cookbook"".  The odd ingredients and types of food that are in this book are just not for my family.  I did like it for a possible ""date night"" alone without the kids.  I would have loved to see kid-friendly and fun recipes from ""The Gourmet Dad"" and so would have our kids.I would give ""The Gourmet Dad"" 3.5 to 4 stars.  Amazon considers three stars as -  ""It's okay"" and four stars are -  ""I like it"".  I would feel comfortable rating this cookbook between the two.  I think finding what's right for you and your family is a personal choice.  It's always hard to find the perfect cookbook.  Some are easier than others and some remind you of home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM10CMJN44V12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892896#wasThisHelpful","RM10CMJN44V12","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been feeding our 2 year old Ori-Pei Royal Canin Mini since we brought her home.  At first, she would eat the entire bowl.  She loved it and looked forward to eating.  But we noticed that as time went on, she started eating less and less.  Our Veterinarian recommended we try Hill's Science Diet.We started off by mixing only a little with her ""regular food"" each day and increased it until the entire bowl was full with the ""new food"", the Hill's Science Diet.  She's back to eating all of her food and ""cleaning her plate"" again.I'm very happy with the results we received with the Hill's Science Diet.  Will she keep it up forever?  Only time will tell.  But I'm willing to stick it out and make sure she's happy any way I can.Charlotte is loved by our entire family.  If it's new food that she needs for her finicky palate, well then that's something we can totally do for her.  She's brought so much joy into all of our lives that it's a pleasure to bring that same joy back to her life.

"I absolutely love everything about the Mai Couture Trio, Like A Diamond.  It's convenient, ready to travel, and gives me just the right amount of touch up color!  I think this is a pretty amazing idea!  I mean, to me, there is so much to love about highlighter and two different blush colors that fit in one little book! You get 60 sheets, 20 of each color in a little gold booklet.  If you're wondering how to apply, they even give instructions in the back of the booklet.The three that I got to test were a highlighter in Crystal Cove, and two different blush colors one in Sunset Blvd. and the other in Studio City.  I love my daily makeup and wear way too much to use just this.  But, this does make the most perfect touch up packet.  I could also see myself using this during the summer if I just needed a light application.  Also, I've taken this with me to the gym!  It's simply the easiest application I've ever tried!  No brushes needed at all!The highlighter is a gorgeous sparkly white color.  It's perfect for highlighting your forehead, the bridge of your nose, and under your eyes (above the top of your cheekbones).  The two different colors of blush are soft and pretty.  Not too dark or really rosy.  More of a coral and a darker pink.  If you like a lot of color on your cheeks, you simply press harder with the paper and in a circular motion up your cheekbone.  If you prefer only a touch of color, use a lighter touch but still move in a circular motion.I like to contour and highlight.  My everyday blush color is a more ""natural"" shade than these.  I think these colors look best on me when I have a tan or a little color to my skin.I do have to say that I liked the convenience of these so much that I've purchased the foundation papers and the Mai Couture Papier Wallet to hold them in.  I highly recommend the Mai Couture Trio!  It's absolutely perfect for the warm summer months coming up when you don't want your makeup running off of your face.  These provide color and convenience!

"I've been looking for a small printer to put in my son's bedroom.  This way he could have his own printer to use without using all of my ink,  Not to mention asking to be in the home office when I need to be doing things for the work that I do. Who would've thought that this small little machine could do so much? This ""Small In One"" does just about everything a much bigger ""All In One"" printer can do.This compact design is perfect for my son's room. It takes up very little space his desk. This alone would make it a perfect choice for a second computer or for use while living in a college dorm room.I'm not a computer tech by any means, but this printer/scanner/copier was easy enough for me to set up all by myself.  I did it wirelessly.  It found my network and I just put in our password.  I can't stress how simple this was!  You can also set up with a USB Cord. (Sold Separately)This prints beautiful pictures.  I mean really gorgeous.  The paper is fed in through the top back of the machine.  This does not automatically print double sided sheets.  It does however hold a nice amount of paper.  One hundred pages!We love the fact that we can print from our iPhones, iPad, iPad Air, and Kindle too. You can basically print from any smartphone or mobile device.  It's equipped for both IOS and Android.Another great little feature the XP-320 has is the built-in SD Slot.  Which is used for PC-free photo printing.  You can basically print from anywhere with this little printer with or without a network!The Epson XP-320 also will scan to Facebook and the cloud for easy photo sharing.  It also saves you money by letting you replace only the color of ink you need when it's run out.You simply can't beat the quality of the Epson XP-320 for the asking price.  It's a beautiful little printer/copier/scanner that will make your everyday tasks a little easier.  We love ours and simply can't say enough about it!

"I've been using Keratin Complex Keratin Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner for about six months now.  This set was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  She recommended them because I had a Brazilian Blowout after I had highlights done.  The Keratin Complex Shampoo and Conditioner are both sulfur free and have kept my hair sleek and shiny.The Keratin Complex has a light, fresh, and clean scent that makes my hair smell wonderful.  It keeps my style straight with no flyaway's even after I blow dry my hair.  I've noticed that my hair is strong and that there is no breakage despite me having the Brazilian Blowout.I wouldn't use anything else on my hair.  I absolutely love the Keratin Complex Shampoo and Conditioner.  It's so important to use the right products on your hair after having a Brazilian Blowout Treatment to make the results last as long as possible.  It may be a little pricey for shampoo and conditioner, but you only need a small amount to get a rich, thick lather.  I think Amazon has the best prices for this shampoo and conditioner hands down!  Amazon beats out my stylist and every other site I've checked to purchase these.I highly recommend the Keratin Complex Keratin Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner for anyone that has had their hair treated.  Including a Brazilian Blowout, Keratin Treatment, highlights, and color.

"I chose this Remington XF8550 Smartedge Advanced Foil Shaver for my oldest son to use.  He has sensitive skin and has always had trouble finding the perfect shaver.  One that doesn't leave his face red and irritated.  He never uses manual razors; just electric shavers mainly due to this issue.  He's had several (Philips) Norelco Shavers and loved them. I'll have to admit that he was completely skeptical and even a little leery to change over to the Remington XF8550.  He thought for sure it wouldn't be able to get a close enough shave especially without needing to press harder than normal.  After trying it out, he had to admit that he couldn't have been more wrong!  He loves it and there are many reasons why.First of all the Remington XF8550 is aesthetically pleasing with it's sleek design and beautiful cobalt blue color. You charge this shaver in the included base for two hours and it gives you ninety minutes of use after a full charge.  But, if you're in a hurry, you can ""quick charge"" it for five minutes and you'll get enough use out of it for a full shaving session.  The Remington XF8550 can be used with or without shaving gel, dry or wet, and it can even be taken into the shower with you.  The rubber handle is a perfect fit for the hand and it will not slip.My son loved the pivoting head and how it does cling to the face. Especially around his chin, jaw, and neck. The Remington XF8550 gave an extremely close shave, neatly trimmed his beard and mustache perfectly.  The trimmer is a necessary feature for my son. It's creates precise lines and details and is great for sideburns or smaller areas that need a close shave like his goatee.If you do come across hair that doesn't shave off easily, you should never press down hard instead it helps to use moderate slow circular strokes. This will help you avoid irritated, red skin or even damage to your new shaver.Cleaning the Remington XF8550 is very easy.  It's suggested that you remove the foil head and rinse under running water.  Once inside is clean, simply replace the foil topper.  The outside of the shaver just can be wiped clean with warm water and a clean rag, no cleaning solution of any kind. Dry with a soft towel.  Remington notes that the teeth of the trimmer should be lubricated with  oil about every six months. Included with this shaver is a two year limited warranty.We highly recommend the Remington XF8550 Advanced Foil Shaver for a perfect, smooth shave every single time.  It's the quick and easy way to get the appearance you're looking for. It's small enough but extremely powerful and even comes with a carrying pouch that fits both the shaver and charging station. This makes the shaver a great choice for travel and for use at the gym. It would even make a wonderful gift for the man in your life or even for yourself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35OY04JE9J17P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGQR93U#wasThisHelpful","R35OY04JE9J17P","A6T1RHMQ9NSE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6T1RHMQ9NSE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I listened to the Whispersync version and will say right away that I didn't care for the narrator's voice and intonations.  This may have caused me to be constantly distracted.  I enjoy ""serial killer"" stories, to a degree, and liked this one because they actually (finally) fleshed out the background of the killer and why he ended up the way he did.  I thought the storyline involving the dog was very good, it added an interesting dimension to the story.  I thought the name given to the killer was pretty dumb, and it irritated me every time I heard it.  I was also irritated that the killer, though never portrayed as being particularly sophisticated in terms of computers or investigation methods, always seemed to be way ahead of both Zoe and the cops.

When I eat garlic,  there has not been a product yet that could end the pain, but this works immediately, most of the time with just 1, occasionally 2.  If Tums doesn't work that great for you, I recommend trying these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MD1OPIS5C2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BV47KTS#wasThisHelpful","R11MD1OPIS5C2M","A2IGU0WV9SUIJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IGU0WV9SUIJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In spite of the price, we didn't expect this to really ""do the job"", but WOW were we surprised!  My husband and I both have lower back issues from time to time and have frequently had the electric stim at the chiropractor's, so that's what we're used to and didn't expect anything even close to that from this unit.Our first surprise was how tiny the unit is.  It's so little that we were sure we were going to be disappointed in what it could do.  Having had it a few weeks now and have both used it a number of times and we are VERY pleased.  We've tried all of the programs and we each have our favorites, but they all do a good job.Pros:  Small and portable, more powerful than expected, provides 3 sets of different pads, the pads are very nicely ""sticky"" and stick well while peeling off fairly easily. Easy to operate, easy to ""get"" what the programs do, variety of programs.Cons:  While they provide 3 sets of pads, we find that we both really only use one set and that is the large set.  We will order more of those, we've found the small ones to not be very useful for our purposes (back).  We also wish it came with a little pouch or holder that we could hang on our waistband when we have to move around with it.All in all, a very nice investment for us.

"I LOVE this thing!!  LOVE it I tell you!  I had it clamped to the top back of one of our leather sofas for a while and it was great...I could lay down on the sofa and have my Asus tablet at EXACTLY the angle I needed it without having to hold it...it's awesome!  Problem is...the clamp that attaches it eventually loosened up a bit and cut into the leather.  Took it off of there and moved it to the bedroom in our RV (where we live full time).  We attached it above my side of the bed to the inside/outside of the small cabinet above the bed (cabinet door lifts straight up & had to stay open, but wow it was so worth it).  It was PERFECT right there.  I could lay in bed and watch tv/netflix, whatever and it would easily adjust to any angle I needed, and I could easily push it out of the way when I was preparing to go to sleep.  Tonight we discovered that again, the clamp had loosened up and had slid down a bit a gouged a big gash into the cabinetry.  NOT happy about that, but we are trying to figure out a way to reattach and avoid damage.  We think a small piece of wood as a buffer will work.  Will try to fix it tomorrow.  My husband is probably going to get one if we can figure out how to keep it from damaging stuff.  This is an awesome little thing, but you really have to think through where to attach it and it REALLY needs a buffer of some type to keep it from damaging things.

I moved my gear from a quite large wedding photog's bag to this and though it didn't ALL fit, all the important stuff did.  It is compact and with a little readjustment, the dividers worked out nicely for me.  I can see that I may redo the dividers at some point, but for now they are fine.It's kind of nice to have all my ""must have"" gear in one neat bag and I stowed the rest in the old bag, which now has room for all manner of accessories that were previously laying around the house.This is my 4th large camera bag, my first Think Tank, and by far the best buy.  For quick airline trips, I can fit the minimum of gear, a couple clothes changes and my tablet, which makes it very convenient.If I had to take a trip that required ALL of my gear, this would not work, but then again...I'd just drive, lol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7EFABDCDV0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007URFIOO#wasThisHelpful","R2D7EFABDCDV0N","A2IGU0WV9SUIJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IGU0WV9SUIJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:01 MinsFINALLY!!  A dryer brush that works as good as, or better, than my old one!  I just got this today and couldn't wait to try it out.  The reviews indicated that it was worth the purchase, and it IS.4 years ago my trusty old conair dryer brush fell apart.  I've been through 3 dryer brushes since then, none of which worked worth a darn, and didn't hold out much hope of finding one at all that would work with my thick longish hair.Well...my hair looks fabulous...BETTER than when I get it done at the salon.  Seems no one at the salon ever listens to me and does my hair *exactly* the way I like it.  Don't have to worry about that anymore.  I can go back to doing it myself, and it looks just the way I want it.  My hair is slightly curly and when left to air dry, it gets frizzy...and if they don't dry it COMPLETELY at the salon...it gets frizzy.  No worries with this - I dry it until it slips through the bristles like silk and I know it's perfect.  The bristles on this brush are really great with my hair.  Most of the ones I've tried in the past few years have ""hair type bristles"" that will not go all the way through my hair and are a real pain.  The bristles on this are a combination of hair and hard plastic bristles...exactly what is needed for thick hair...they work great.I saw where several people complained about the controls...I didn't find that to be a problem for me at all.  They are right at the perfect place where I can easily slide it from low to high or to cool.  I usually only use high anyway, but I didn't think it was an issue.I will post a video review when I get time.LOVE this product!*ADDED COMMENT*  January 15, 2015: I am still using this dryer brush and still love it!  I am purchasing one for my Mom, in fact.  I would love to add a couple of before/after pics, but cannot figure out how to do that.  This is the only drying tool I use, and 98% of the time, except for heat protectant,  I don't use mousse or any other product to make my hair behave, and it's always perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAQEBAAFX8ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056GDG90#wasThisHelpful","RMAQEBAAFX8ZE","A2IGU0WV9SUIJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IGU0WV9SUIJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this balsamic vinegar.  I do prefer it in the bottle with the snap on/off lid, but have trouble finding it.  I usually buy a regular bottle and pour it into the other bottle.I tend to use balsamic vinegar on many things...salads (both leafy green and fruit salads), I sometimes make lettuce (or endive) wrap ""sandwiches"" and use it on those, I pour it over meat and seafood and use it as a marinade frequently.I recently made grilled brussel sprout halves, and after placing them on the plate to serve, I drizzled this balsamic over them lightly and everyone raved about them.  It added a really nice little kick to them.I've tried A LOT of balsamic vinegars and NONE comes close to this.  I keep extra bottles on hand so that I never run out.We just had simple salad of fresh spinach with fresh sliced heirloom tomatoes drizzled with this and it is awesome...you don't need anything else added to the salad to make it delicious!The taste of this balsamic is deep, rich and complex...satisfies with both a delicious sweetness and a bold sourness that is perfectly balanced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ULEDNGL14XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S9OVTA#wasThisHelpful","R26ULEDNGL14XU","A2IGU0WV9SUIJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IGU0WV9SUIJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second book in the Bruno Chief of Police series. I was given the first book as a gift and I was hooked. This second book is just as good as the first. I love the setting - St. Denis, France in the Dordogne district. Bruno Coureges is a wonderful protagonist. He's a policeman who knows his community, and he understands human nature. He is smart, compassionate, warm and kind. These books have wonderful secondary characters too and I'm beginning to get to know the whole of community of St. Denis after only two books. There's always a lot of French history in the books (for example the Resistance in the second WW). In this book Bruno is called out early in the morning to a barn fire, and has he investigates he realizes it's arson. The best part of the books though is the descriptions of the characters tasting the great wines of the region, and sampling what sounds like wonderful food. Both of these things would have me sold on their own, but the books are well-written. The plots are tight, the setting is delicious and Bruno is so very likeable.

"Sara Paretsky proves once again that she is one of the best mystery writers out there.  This book is a real wild ride.  I read through the book at breakneck pace.  The tension never lets up from the first page right up to the very end where Ms. Paretsky treats us to such a menacing ending.  What she does best is her characterization.  Her bad guys are really bad guys and VI always finds herself on the wrong side of them and she's quite often in the unenviable place of being on the outs with Chicago's finest at the same time.  In this book we get a good look at VI's young growing up years in the rough south end of Chicago.  An old flame asks for her help to gather information to help get an exoneration for his mother who has just served 25 years in prison for killing her daughter who was Frank's sister. It goes against everything VI wants to do.  She does not want to dredge up all the memories of her childhood when her mother and father were both alive, but she is forced into helping when some old acquaintances start bad -mouthing her family and herself. At great risk to herself ,she sets out to clear the name of her famous cousin Boom Boom Warshawski who was a stellar hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks.  I love VI.  She's such a champion of the truth and will do anything to help people who come to her for help.  Non-stop action, and the developing relationship between VI and her musician boyfriend Jake were what kept me flipping pages in this book.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICEHCF8896ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160574#wasThisHelpful","RICEHCF8896ED","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As it turns out, she can get herself into all kinds of trouble -  certainly more than her absent-minded father can even imagine.  This series is a delight and we are treated to the most unique sleuth you'll find in the mystery genre.  For those that don't know Flavia, she's an 11 year old precocious girl who loves chemistry, poisons and loves solving puzzles.  The book is set in England in the 50's and mostly around Flavia's remote English village and her crumbling pile of a home called Buckshaw.  We have her two evil sisters Feely and Daffy who enjoy nothing more than making Flavia's life a torment.  In this book Flavia visits an old gypsy woman to get her fortune told at the parish fair, and due to an accident that Flavia caused, she becomes involved in the gypsy woman's life.  When the gypsy is found beaten in her trailer, Flavia is on the trail of the person who did it.  Then another body turns up and she's in full sleuth mode.  She and her trusty Gladys (Flavia's bicycle) are seen peddling all over the county. These books are a true delight and Flavia is a wonderful protagonist.  The mysteries are tricky and the characters wonderful. This a great series for mystery lovers who enjoy their mysteries a little offbeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNY5V6T31C19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GTLKGO#wasThisHelpful","R3RNY5V6T31C19","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been on my to read list for a long time and I finally got to it.  This book is a wonderful portrayal of life, hope, learning to live with past mistakes and it's also a wonderful place to meet truly great characters.  Harold Fry is a 60 year old man living in retirement in Devon, UK with his wife Maureen.  He has led a very small life just trying to earn enough money to support his wife and son David.  He had worked for many years at a local brewery. Then 20 years before this book was set, a terrible personal event occurred which changed his life and his marriage forever.  One morning he receives a letter from an old colleague that he used to work with.  Queenie Hennessey has written to him after 20 years to tell him that she is dying of cancer.  This profoundly affects Harold and he sets out to post a letter to Queenie and ends up deciding to walk all the way to Berwick where she is at a hospice.  Through telephone calls to the hospice and to through letters and postcards, Harold tells Queenie to wait and not to die because he is walking to her.  The trip is more than 600 miles!  While he walks he goes over his whole life and faces his demons.  He picks up a bunch of people on the way that want to do the pilgrimage with him.  It's a motley crew that follows with him.  Back at home his wife Maureen faces a number of demons on her own, and she comes to an awareness while her husband is on his unlikely pilgrimage.  This is a heartwarming and profound book that even caused me to do some reevaluation of my own.  As Harold says to himself, everyone looks normal on the outside, but you never know what is going on inside and what has happened to them in the past to shape them into the people they are now.  This was a Globe and Mail best book selection, and I understand why.  I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YDXTPJJ1MCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00735HGQ6#wasThisHelpful","R39YDXTPJJ1MCL","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved Bill Slider from the get-go.  He's an everyday man who happens to run a tight murder squad.  Each of his team has special skills, and Bill's skill is to make them each want to achieve.  Bill sits back and analyzes and puts the pieces together.  And all this is done with light humour, puns, double entendres, and of course Bill's commanding officer Porson who deserves a book of his own.  His malapropisms are wonderful and make me laugh every time.  In this case Bill and his team have to figure out who killed an antique seller who does a TV show on antiques.  As they did deeper they find that the victim is more unsavoury than they imagined, and found the list of suspects growing by the minute.  They manage to slog through all the dirt and solve the crime.  I love this series.  It's smart, tricky and there's always a tight plot.  Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of British police procedurals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P8XWUVU1CMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHUMNF0#wasThisHelpful","R9P8XWUVU1CMR","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 19 book in the Matthew Bartholomew series, and I have enjoyed each and every one of them.  Ms. Gregory' 14 century mystery series set in Cambridge, England is always one that brings history to life.  The books are always very entertaining and the mysteries are always tricky.  There is one thing that the books always have and that's lots of murder and mayhem with some light comic relief with Matt's portly friend Brother Michael, and with other members of Michaelhouse College.  This book offers that as well, but this one is set entirely outside of Cambridge.  Matthew, Brothers Michael, William, Clippesby,Matt's book-bearer Cynric and the head of their college Ralph Langelee are all on a trip for the bishop to the town of Peterborough to find our what happened to the abbot from Peterborough.  He went out for a ride with the village of physician to a neighbouring village and never returned.  Matt and his Michaelhouse crew find themselves in a den of iniquity.  The list of sins in the town is long and Matthew and Michael are at their wits end trying to unravel the mystery of the disappearance of the two citizens.  Murders are happening around them, and there is a regular rogues gallery of people that live in the pretty little town.  I enjoyed the book, but found it a bit rushed and the book seemed to skip around a bit this time.  Still an enjoyable sojourn into 14th century England, and I really enjoy the characters and the interactions between them.  The settings are always perfectly described.  It's like a step back in time reading a Matthew Bartholomew book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PJBIHTVW9LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU2VRFO#wasThisHelpful","R25PJBIHTVW9LJ","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2.  I thought this would be an interesting book to read as it has Sherlock Holmes in it and his sidekick in this case is not Doctor Watson, but Henry James the author.  I am a big fan of The Portrait of a Lady written by Henry James, so thought it would be interesting.  Dan Simmons does a pretty good job of recreating Holmes and the referrals to his past cases helped me to connect this new Sherlock to my much-loved sleuth written by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The literary references throughout the book were fun as well.  We meet Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) who is a favourite of mine and the references to his wonderful classic, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn helped to bring old Samuel to life.  The case though, unfortunately, wasn't nearly as well delineated as the original Sherlock Holmes cases.  I found the book unnecessarily long and there were too many side stories and errant plot threads.  I managed to slog through the 700 plus pages, but it was tough going, and I kept hoping for things to come together finally which would help make this Herculean effort worthwhile.  Well they did to a point, but not enough to tie up everything in a nice neat bow.  There was still a lot of debris lying around after I finished the last page.  Is it worth the effort to read this book?  Perhaps, especially if you're a bibliophile like me and would like another look at some favourite classical authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NVL4HK148GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLIIZHU#wasThisHelpful","R37NVL4HK148GV","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really don't know what to say about this book.  It came to me highly recommended by numerous people because they know I am a big fan of Canadian literature.  I know that David Adams Richards is a wonderful novelist.  His stories are stark and bleak, and they don't always have happy endings.  His books are difficult to read because they are filled with sadness and hopelessness and this one is no different. Even the ending in this book seems to return full circle to that terrible summer of 1985 along the Mirimichi River.  The story goes back and forth seamlessly from summer and fall of 1985 to the year 2007 as we follow the life of Markus Paul.  In 1985 Markus is only 15 years old.  His mother and father are dead and he lives with his wise old grandfather Amos Paul who happens to the chief of the Micmac reserve they live on.  This story is about guilt and lies, but it is also about the giant chasm between the native Canadians and their white neighbours.  This is certainly not a new story, but it is one that hasn't changed much over one hundred years.  A young 17 year old Micmac boy is killed in a workplace accident while he was unloading pulp on a vessel. The hold he was working on held five people, including himself-3 white males, 1 small child and Hector Penniac.  Somehow Hector ends up dead and the repercussions of his death rock the First Nations reserve as well as their close white neighbours.  Lives are changed forever with this terrible tragedy and it takes 21 years and the perseverance of Marcus Paul, now a decorated RCMP officer, to finally solve the puzzle of what happened on board the Lutheran.  By that time 2 people had lost their lives as a result of the incident, and Amos Paul, Markus' grandfather has died.  It was Amos that knew that something wasn't right about the 4th hold.  He held onto that idea until he died even though it caused him to lose his position as chief and also it caused the people on his reserve to turn away from him.  Amos was too meek and mild to get his point across, and instead it was left to the bullies and misguided young men on the Reserve to take action.  That is what caused all the death, distrust and damage.  The wrong solution to the crime won out over the right one because the men who propounded their solution were loud and made sure that their point was the one that was put forth.  It forever changed lives of many people that were touched by the tragedy and resulted in hopelessness and despair to those left on the reserve.  Markus' determination to solve the crime finally bears fruit, and the truth will help his community to heal.  That is the happy ending that we get in this book.  The happy ending doesn't come to Markus Paul.  We see so clearly how small actions and the resulting cover-up can send shock waves through a community.  We learn that ""it's not the trap that kills the beaver, but the drowning that follows.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12DV9D9N05VTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPZ6DI#wasThisHelpful","R12DV9D9N05VTP","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to reading this book even though I knew at the outset that it's not in a genre I normally read.  I thought it would be different enough and interesting enough to make it palatable.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  I was disappointed.  The writing is actually quite juvenile in spots.  It was unbelievable too.  I realize that time travel is an interesting and intriguing concept, but I didn't find that the main character was real in either time frame.  And the ending is just so abrupt and didn't resolve anything.  I can't recommend this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8PKI23JQ792/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WB7KBS#wasThisHelpful","R1H8PKI23JQ792","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book written by the marvellous Hugh MacLennan and was originally released in 1945.  Its a novel that has been on my to read list for a long time and it is a must-read classic for all Canadians.  The novel revolves around the city of Montreal and the province of Quebec from just before the beginning of World War I and ends just as World War II begins in 1939.  There are so many layers and so many intricacies in this book and it is defined by two solitudes as the title suggests.  The two solitudes are varied.  There are the solitudes of the English-speaking Canadians and the French-speaking Canadians, and the book depicts so clearly why there has been so much discord between the two nationalities in Canada.  It depicts the solitudes of the Canadian way and Canada and our nearest neighbours the United States of America, and how and why there are such differences between the two countries.  The most glaring thing is that Canadians really never considered themselves a separate country until after the second World War.  We came into our own after that war, mostly because of the bravery and valour of the soldiers who fought and died in that war.  Canada took its rightful place on the world stage after that war.  There are the two solitudes of the fictional characters in the book.  Young French-Canadian Paul Tallard, the son of a fading French Canadian aristocrat, is the soldering iron that connects the old French Canadian families to the English-speaking proletariat characters who controlled the money and affairs of Canada and its destiny.  As Paul struggles with his English and French Canadian identities, he goes through many epiphanies that enable him to understand the solitudes and why they are there.  When the book opens, the world and Canada are on the brink of war (WWI), but the world is also on the brink of enormous change and Canada is on the precipice of taking the leap forward or not - forever remaining a little country outpost in the British empire.  As we all know we took the leap and became the Canada we are today.  The main characters in the book are wonderfully drawn, but what really drew me in to the book is MacLennans love for Canada and for our vast and beautiful country.  It was humbling to realize just how important and wonderful my country is.  Its one of those things that Ive always known, but never really took the time to really examine.  Its the best place on earth and Mr. MacLennan makes that abundantly clear throughout this wonderful book.  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRC95LU9A5H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031TZANY#wasThisHelpful","RIRC95LU9A5H1","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Your heart will break for little Matthew Homes as you read this startling debut novel written by Nathan Filer. Mr. Filer is a mental-health nurse, and I think that he must be an outstanding one with loads of empathy and unlimited understanding of his patients as this novel so clearly portrays.  This book provides the reader with a clear and merciless image of the workings of the mind of someone who suffers from schizophrenia.  This story is written totally and completely by Matthew, and it begins and ends with the tragic death of Matthew's older brother Simon when Matt was 8 and Simon was 13.  Simon was a Down's Syndrome child whose little life lit up the lives of all the people in his family.  He was loving and happy and he adored his little brother Matthew.  When Simon dies, Matt and his family do not get over it, and Matthew especially carries around his childhood guilt into adulthood.  It follows him throughout his brave struggle with his disease which materializes when he is about 17.  It follows him throughout his stays in the mental health wing of the hospital and in his flat where he goes when he is released from hospital.  It follows him in his dealings with his parents and with the rest of his family.  It never leaves him, and while he is carrying this guilt, he cannot begin to really get a handle on dealing with his illness.  Matthew decides to face his demons and he goes back to where the terrible accident happened, and then, once he is there, and begins to see things in a grown up way, he actually begins to move forward with his recovery.  This is a heartbreaking and lovely book that is both hopeless and hopeful at the same time.  The strength of Matthew and his determination to face his demons makes you believe in the resilience of the human race.  This is one of those rare books that will stay with you for a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BTKOA48AAZSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250026989#wasThisHelpful","R1BTKOA48AAZSX","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has to be the most disturbing book that I have ever read!  There were so many times that I almost quit reading the book because I couldn't take the sadness and creepiness.  There is not a lot of hope in this book, and the characters' back stories are so bleak and gruesome.  The only thing that made me continue reading was the character Ephram.  Even though his childhood story was as bad as Ruby's, he somehow remained unsullied by it. He is a strong, compassionate and believable character.  Another thing that kept me reading was the lyrical prose and the wonderful descriptive power of Ms. Bonds.  The book certainly brings religious zeal front and foremost as well.  The two women in Ephram's life are on opposite ends of the religious spectrum.  His sister Celia is a high member in their fundamentalist church.  She raised Ephram on her own since his mother was taken away when he was eight.  And then we come to Ruby who Ephram has loved from afar since he was a child.  Ruby's close connection to the spirit world and her very troubled life have made her into a lost soul who roams throughout her old home town of Liberty, Texas.  Ephram must make a very difficult choice.  Does he stay with the sister who raised him, or does he go this very strange and damaged person who he has loved since childhood? This was a very difficult book to read and one that I found too disturbed for my taste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JHMNOYWA6LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RIM9S#wasThisHelpful","R11JHMNOYWA6LW","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read about this book on Kirkus Reviews and thought it might be worthwhile to read it.  I was interested in the setting - the hollers within the Ozarks.  The book was formulaic and predictable I thought.  The book flips back and forth in time, although not always seamlessly.  We have 16 year old Lucy who is present day and all of her friends and family, and her mother Lila after she arrived in the town of Henbane at the age of 18.  The connecting thread between the two times is the mysterious disappearance of two different girls - one in Lila's time and one in Lucy's.  Lucy has been traumatized by the disappearance of her friend Cheri, who was considered slow-minded by the folks in Henbane.  When her dismembered body was found placed in a tree in Henbane a few weeks later, the small community is reeling from the shock and terror.  The more Lucy digs to try to find out what happened to Cherie, the more secrets and lies she discovers.  Lucy's mother disappeared when Lucy was just a baby, and no one in the town has any idea where she went or what happened to her.  Lucy's findings while trying to find out what happened to Cherie lead her to believe that her mother's strange disappearance 14 years before is somehow connected.  I found the book didn't really build up tension and I was guessing what was going to happen in the next chapter most of the way through.  I don't feel that I can recommend this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYEASG0Z5CY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8FA30E#wasThisHelpful","R1HYEASG0Z5CY5","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read Ms. Robsin's first book about the Great War and enjoyed it so was looking forward to reading this one. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much. I liked Charlotte Brown. She is an emancipated woman who received a university degree just before the start of the Great War. She then served four years as an army nurse during WWI. Once the war is over, she comes back to Liverpool and works in an agency that helps demobilized veterans and their families. Charlotte loves her job even though it's hard for her to hear the terribly sad stories of the destitute families she sees on a daily basis.  We meet Charlotte's friends and family and we meet the man she has loved in secret since just after she met him. We see the courage that Charlotte displays while trying to manage her job and her feelings for this man whom she knows is an unsuitable match for her because of their very different social positions. It all sounds like a great idea for a plot, but I just didn't find the story totally believable. It felt like I was looking through rosy-coloured glasses at a very sad and heart-rending scenario. It just didn't grab me like I thought it should. Maybe it was because I felt the story placed the emphasis on the romantic aspect more than it did on what I know was the reality in post WWI England.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1ZNROH8SMLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOG4UWU#wasThisHelpful","R2O1ZNROH8SMLM","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There has been much hype about this book, so I was glad when my e-book came in so that I could read it.  I was not disappointed with the book and, in fact, I enjoyed it more than Gone Girl and The Paying Guests, which are the two most recent books I've read of this genre.  I think the three female viewpoints help to keep the book interesting and it certainly helps to maintain the tension.  All three women are strong characters, and the three main male characters are realistic and strong too.  Rachel is the main character, and when we meet her, she is a train wreck.  She's lost her husband and her job, and she drowns her sorrows in alcohol.  All the time I was reading about her blackout drunks, I felt that there was a lot more behind the drinking than even she admits to herself. Megan is another woman who has lost her job.  Even though she has a husband who loves her, she is profoundly unhappy.  Her sorrow is as a result of a past event that happened to her years ago, and it  causes her to make many bad choices that will eventually come to a catastrophic conclusion. Anna appears to be the most normal one, but even she has personal crises that cause her distress and her ""perfect"" life is really not what it appears.  The males that are involved with these women, both past and present, have their own demons that will have a profound impact on these women and on their lives.  The thing that ties up all the loose threads in the story and all the lives of these characters is the commuter train that runs by their houses at many different times of the day.  The train is the one constant thing that never changes and it's what brings all these people into proximity.  As the tension builds, masks are removed and the three women finally begin to see things clearly. For some it is too late.  For others a long overdue redemption finally comes to them. Nothing really is as it seems in this little community. The book is a very good psychological thriller and I enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L1P3U8W1HK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M60RKW8#wasThisHelpful","R7L1P3U8W1HK8","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a book that I've been looking forward to reading since I saw the first reviews of it in Kirkus Reviews.  I have always loved the Hollywood from the 1940s and 1950's.  The actors and actresses were so glamorous and so much larger than life.  Movies were magical experiences and the release of a new movie was a huge social event.  None more so than the hype around Gone With the Wind.  When the movie came out in December of 1939, it changed the movie industry forever.  First, it was long (almost 4 hours), and it was packed to the gills with big name talent like Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Vivian Leigh and many others. The movie won 9 Oscars and it  has made $1.64 billion since it's release (when adjusted for inflation).  This book gives us a birds-eye view of the making of this blockbuster and is full of real-life people like Clark Gable and Carol Lombard.  The fictional characters are well-drawn and realistic too and the story is magical, as it's name implies.  Young Julie heads to Hollywood to try to become a screenwriter.  As she is from Fort Wayne, and as Carol Lombard was from there, they develop a friendship when they meet and Julie's first job in Hollywood was  Lombard's assistant.  Ms. Alcott has penned a delighttlul portrayal of the uninhibited Lombard and her relationship with Gable.  They were a true Hollywood love match that ended way too soon with Lombard's death in a plane crash at the age of 33. But this book is about Gone With the Wind and the magic that went into the making of this wonderful film.  Yes, there were lots of difficulties and pitfalls in the creation, but the film is arguably one of the best ever made. I love the movie and I really enjoyed this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3FSAOOHDTJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZW93QI#wasThisHelpful","R1J3FSAOOHDTJ7","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank heavens for my Secret Santa on LibraryThing.  It was because of her thoughtful gift that I got a copy of this novel, and it was because I was so backed up with my reading that I haven't gotten around to the books that were chosen for me until now.  If I had known what I had here, I would have read it before the end of 2014.  This is one of the best crime stories that I've ever read.  The setting is rural England and it is just after The Great War.  We are introduced to Inspector Madden, who is an inspector in Scotland Yard.  He is a soldier who has returned from the war, but he is a forever-changed man from the experiences of the horrific fighting in France.  Madden is extremely intelligent and intuitive, but he appears to be forever sad and withdrawn.  We meet Madden when he is called to a particularly gruesome murder scene in a manor house near a small country village.  Five butchered bodies have been discovered inside the manor house and there is no idea how this crime took place.  Many want to say it was the work of a botched robbery, but John Madden senses that something far more sinister is at play here.  As he delves deeper and deeper into the psyche of the killer with the fetching Dr. Helen Blackwell beside him, he tries to get his man without further senseless loss of life.  All of Scotland Yard is on the tail of this brutal killer.  Airth weaves a very suspenseful tale - one that weaves from hunters to hunted seamlessly.  The sense of time and space is depicted so realistically throughout the book.  This book is that wonderful combination of mystery, suspense and fine literary writing that we don't see that often in the mystery genre. I can't wait to read more John Madden novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB177YW1756W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143035703#wasThisHelpful","RB177YW1756W3","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the Inspector Banks series, and have been reading my way through the series.  This book was good with the characters fully fleshed out and enough suspense to keep me turning pages, but it didn't have the ""slam in the gut"" plot twists that I've come to expect from Peter Robinson.  I had figured out who the perpetrator was about halfway through, and that never usually happens with an Inspector Banks book.  That is why I gave the book four stars instead of my usual five.  There is an arsonist in and around Eastvale, and people are being burned in their homes.  At first there doesn't appear to be a connection between the two fires, but as Banks and his team start digging, they find some old history between two of the victims.  The characters in these books are what sets this series apart from other police procedurals.

"This has got to be the most eclectic and strange pairing of detectives that you'll ever find in crime fiction.  Bryant and May are introduced to us here in the first book of the Peculiar Crimes Unit.  This strange crime unit is located in London.  The time is actually 2005 (when the book was released), but it flips back to crimes in 1940 at the beginning of WWII and right during the Blitz.  Bryant and May, when we meet them are old curmudgeonly detectives that have worked together in the Peculiar Crimes Units for six decades.  They are each brilliant in their own way, and each compliments the other in their detective style.  May is the practical one and Bryant is the nerdy, unorthodox and the one who firmly believes in the occult and in magic.  This book covers these two old detectives as they solve their first case together (during the war) and their last case in the present day.  A very strange murder occurs in an old London theatre called The Palace.  Somehow the two crime sprees that occur in the book are connected, even though there is a 60 year break between them.  I enjoyed the premise and I liked the characters, but I found the book very confusing to read at times.  And there was far too much theatre-lore in it to my taste.  It was hard to get caught up in the mystery and thrill because of the constant switching back and forth.  This could be an interesting premise for a detective series, and I'm presuming that the author's writing skills will improve with each additional book, but I'm not sure that I'll be reading any more in this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA3CLWHJMHWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC1QNI#wasThisHelpful","R2PA3CLWHJMHWI","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched the mini-series  on Lifetime earlier this year, and I really enjoyed it so I had to read the book.  I wish I had read the book first because I always enjoy the books so much more, but the mini-series was well-done, and as close to the book as it could be.  The story is about Dinah who was Jacob's only daughter in his family of 12 sons. Jacob is the biblical patriarch who was son to Isaac.  His brother was Esau.  Not much is written in the Bible about Dinah, but Ms. Diamant has done a wonderful job of fleshing out her life and making her real.  We see a young girl in a family of boys who is raised by four remarkable women.  Jacob had four wives and the wives he had were all sisters.  There was Leah, who was Dinah's mother, Rachel who was the beautiful one and a skillful midwife, Zilpah and Bilhah who were the lesser wives of Jacob, but each unique in her own way.  This family of remarkable women were wonderful role-models for Dinah, and they help her achieve her goal of becoming a successful midwife just like her aunt Rachel.  This remarkable story is told from Dina's viewpoint.  We experience her happiness and sadness and her blessings and her great tragedy first-hand.  It is a deeply moving tale of women and their remarkable resilience traced back all the way to the biblical era.  Its a tremendously poignant book that forces the reader to examine their own feelings and perceptions, and Dinah is wonderful creation and she will stay with you long after you close the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8PXB3YAKKW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FA5PZU#wasThisHelpful","R2U8PXB3YAKKW6","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am actually regretting that I spent the time to read this book.  In my defense, I have enjoyed the Hannah Swenson series up to about book 14, but the series has been going downhill since then.  I had actually decided to quit reading the series after Red Velvet Cupcake Murder (Number 16), but I was perusing book lists and saw that a new one had come out last year and this one for this year.  I decided to read them both.  Blackberry Pie Murder was all right, and at least readable, but I wasn't really prepared for this one.  In this book, the recipes and Hannah's so-called love life took over the entire book, and the murder was so secondary, I almost forgot who got murdered by halfway through.  The writing is juvenile as well.  I don't think we as readers need step-by-step instructions on how to text on a cell phone, but that is what we got.  This book appeared to be written by a pre-teen author to my mind - not at all written in the way that I know Joanne Fluke can write.  I'm sad to see this enjoyable series deteriorate so badly, and I will be giving up on the series for sure now.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WY1G67EUEDN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758280408#wasThisHelpful","R2WY1G67EUEDN1","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this book as a Christmas gift and finally got around to reading it.  It was Sofi Oksanen's first book that was translated into the English language from Finnish.  This is a book that is not easy to read.  it is visceral, tragic, and gut-wrenching.  The book is set around the second world war, and during the narrative it skips ahead to 1992 and then back to 1944.  It is set Estonia, and it tells the tale of how Estonia suffered during and after the second world war.  During the war, the Germans occupied this country, and it was very difficult for the native peoples to try to live under their tyrannical rule.  After the war it became a Russian country and the Russians brought more pain and misery to the mostly rural population in this country.  The Estonians gained their independence from Russia in 1991.  The story is told from the perspective of Aliide who lived through both occupations.  When we first see her in 1992, she is an old woman who carries around a tremendous burden of secrets from her long life. She discovers a bruised and battered young girl at the gate to her property, and in a moment of weakness, she takes her in and cleans her up and feeds her.  We see that Aliide and the young girl called Zara share a past and a history, and how and why becomes brutally clear to us.  Both have been through hell and both used terribly by brutish men.  This is where the reading gets difficult as we find out what each of these women have suffered.  The book is gut-wrenching and forces us as readers to think about how far we would go to save ourselves and our loved ones if faced with the realities that each of these women have experienced. Can we judge their choices harshly when we realize that very difficult decisions have to be made in order to survive? No one in this book is unscathed by the harsh realities and horrors of war. The book is extremely well-written, and I'm sure we have not heard the end of Sofi Oksanen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJG7PPTLJHSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H8GMBC#wasThisHelpful","R1HJG7PPTLJHSV","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a totally delightful series, and even after so many books (I think this is the 37 in the series), the series remains fresh and enjoyable.  That is quite a feat for a long-running cozy mystery series.  In this book Inspector Witherspoon has been tasked to find the murderer of an old nemesis of his.  The woman was one that had gotten away from the law many years previously, and then she suddenly is found dead right in the middle of Highgate Cemetary.  There are a lot of long-buried skeletons in closets and old and new grudges surrounding the dead woman.  Witherspoon and Constable Barnes keep on finding more clues and many dark secrets as they turn over stones during their investigation.  The case is confusing enough that even Mrs. Jeffries is flummoxed for awhile.  It is always wonderful catching up with these old Victorian friends, and I thoroughly enjoy this series.  It is one of my favourites in this genre for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX9538D68KPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPX3CV6#wasThisHelpful","R2PX9538D68KPZ","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in the Lighthouse Library Mystery Series.  This series shows a lot of promise. It has a likeable heroine who isn't afraid to laugh at herself.  It has strong supporting characters and a tight-knit community.  The location is the Outer Banks area off the coast of North Carolina, and the setting is an old restored lighthouse that has been converted into a library.  What more could a cozy mystery lover want?  A tricky little mystery, that's what.  This book has all of this.  Lucy is a librarian who has left her job at the Harvard library after ten years.  She leaves her Boston life and high profile family, and moves to the islands where she spent time as a child with her favourite aunt and her family.  She has just gotten the job of Assistant Librarian at the Lighthouse Library on Bodie Island.  She loves her new job and her new life as well as her small apartment on the fourth floor of the lighthouse where she works, but she hardly has time to get settled in, when a murder occurs in her library - just two floors below her little apartment.  Can Lucy and her new friends uncover the killer, and figure out what has happened to some rare books that seem to have gone missing from the library?  You have to read to find out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIN105LFF6DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLZW8#wasThisHelpful","R3RIN105LFF6DD","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book from my LibraryThing Secret Santa,  who I would like to acknowledge.  Thank you so much for introducing me to a delightful new series set in France's beautiful Dordogne region (which is located east of Bordeaux).  The book is a police procedural mystery set in the present day that introduces us to Bruno the Chief of Police in St. Denis located in Dordogne.  Mr. Walker allows us to make the acquaintance of  a wonderful new protagonist, and he also introduced me to the beautiful region in France where this series is set.  Bruno is one of the most sincere detectives you'll ever read about, and his knowledge of his area and of his people is what helps him the most when trying to solve complex cases.  In this book an elderly man is found murdered in his remote cottage, and he has had a swastika cut into his chest.  Bruno joins forces with a couple of national police forces to try to solve what looks like a racist crime. As a result of Bruno's investigation,  we are taken back to the second world war and to the very active French Resistance movement in the Dordogne region during the latter part of the war.  Bruno delves deeper and deeper into history to try to figure out what happened to this apparently harmless old Algerian man and as he digs, he finds that the crime is much more complicated than it appears.  What a great atmospheric mystery, and I want to pursue this series now that I've been introduced to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7JPV3V9G6DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030745469X#wasThisHelpful","RA7JPV3V9G6DM","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot believe that this book is a debut novel for Rebecca Rotert.  This book will lift you up, and then suddenly cast you down.  It will rip out your insides and then calmly place them back in.  My heart broke over and over for ten year old Sophia.  There is a mind-numbing sadness at times in this book, but then in the next chapter something warm and wonderful happens, and hope soars again.  This so exactly portrays the emotions that Sophia's mother Naomi experiences in her never-ending search for stardom and fame.  The time is 1960's Chicago and the backdrop is a hot and sultry jazz club called The Blue Angel.  The story is told in the first person from two viewpoints - little precocious Sophia and her talented but perplexing mother Naomi.  The writing is smooth and poetic and it carries the reader along formidably to the very tragic ending.  The cost that unrelenting ambition has on people close to the person with the ambition is calamitous and it spares no one in its wake.  This is a heartbreaker of a book, bur so wonderfully written that it almost becomes a part of you as you read it.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKKB2168LAJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062315285#wasThisHelpful","R3MKKB2168LAJF","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I'd given up on this series after the last book, but I decided to give another book a try.  This series was very enjoyable in the earlier books, but it has been going downhill for awhile now.  I didn't dislike this particular book as much as I did The Red Velvet Cupcake Murder, but it was very hurried and the storyline didn't develop very well.  The characters were still enjoyable though.  I always liked Hannah and her friends, but she still hasn't made up her mind between her two suitors, and they are both still hanging around waiting for her to decide.  That really does push this series beyond belief.  In this book, Hannah finds herself on the wrong side of the law and she has to rely on her friends and her family to help her through.  As usual, her baking helps her cope as well.  The ending paves the way for the next book as Hannah's problems are not resolved this time.  I guess I'll continue with the series as I still want to know what will happen to the characters in the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20R1RSHXUVFC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLPWBLM#wasThisHelpful","R20R1RSHXUVFC5","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to read this book because it as a group-read for the Afterword Reading Society of the National Post.  The book is written by a Canadian author, and it is set in Ontario in the early 1990's, but it touches on Canada from the 1970's until 1993.  1993 in Canada was a year of note.  That was the year that Paul Bernardo was arrested for crimes he committed in Toronto.  Evie Jones is a young reporter assigned to follow the investigation after Bernardo's arrest.  It brings back many memories of Evie's childhood.  When she was 11 years old, her friend Lianne Gagnon was abducted and murdered.  The murderer was never found.  The neighbourhood that the two girls lived in were reeling in shock, and the crime forever changed the lives of the people who lived in the neigbourhood, including Evie.  The story is told in the first person through Evie, and we see how losing her young friend has affected her even now many years later.  The investigation into Bernardo's history, has brought some unresolved issued front and centre into Evie's life, and to make matters worse, she thinks she has a stalker following her.  She sets out to try to solve her friend's murder while wresting her own demons.  The book was well-written, but I found that the tension was not really maintained throughout.  At times it was hard to determine the difference between what was real and what Evie was imagining.  I started to lose interest about 2/3 of the way through the book.  I loved the Canadian references though, and appreciated what appeared to be an insider's look at the effect that a such a tragedy has on the people who are close to the incident (such as neighbours and friends).","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HYO3GRBYFMMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTTMV2U#wasThisHelpful","R3HYO3GRBYFMMA","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a pleasant change for me to read this delightful little book after I had just finished reading two very heavy (literally and figuratively) novels.  I wanted something that would make me laugh and this book did that.  The references to books and authors throughout added to the enjoyment.  This is a charming story set on remote Alice Island.  A. J. Fikry is a bookseller in this remote little place, and when we first meet him, he is trying to drink himself to death.  He lost his wife in a car accident about a year and a half before the story opens.  Then something happens to change his perspective totally.  Someone inexplicably leaves a surprise for him in his bookstore, and A.J. does a complete about-face and decides that drinking himself to death isn't the answer,  There is a lot to love and and a lot to enjoy in the world after all.  The language in this book is  delightful, and the character development quite astounding considering it is only 200 pages long.  I loved A. J., and I especially liked the supporting characters.  It was a wonderful little read for a cold winter's day, and a must-read for book lovers and for those who love to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QDFGS7ISISB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGBE178#wasThisHelpful","R36QDFGS7ISISB","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This very surprising little book covers one day in the life of Baruch Kotler.  By the time we meet him he is sixty years old and a disgraced Israeli politician.  But before his public disgrace, he was a much-admired and much-loved Jewish martyr.  Baruch spent 13 years of his young life incarcerated in a brutish Russian prison.  Baruch had been very recently married when he was arrested, and he and his young wife were emigrating to Israel when he was picked up by the Russian police.  His wife went on ahead without him, but held out hope and did much campaigning to see Baruch freed.  Without compromising his principles, and without pleading guilty to being a radical Jew, he managed to be freed and then he went to Israel to be with his wife and to raise his family.  He becomes a hero to the Israeli people, and is a politician in the Israeli government, when he suddenly gives it all up to run away from Israel to Yalta in the Crimea with his young mistress.  The book time frame starts when he and Leora arrive in Yalta, and then continues for the next 24 hours.  In that short time Baruch is forced by a very strange coincidence, to face the person who had denounced him to the KGB 40 years before.  He must learn to reconcile the choices he has made because of his incarceration.  He must face the devastation that he has brought to his family, and he must learn to accept and live with the choices he has made, as well as to reconsider his position as to where he goes from here.  A lot happens within these 24 hours and I think the most amazing thing is that David Bezmozgis says it all so clearly and so succintly in what is actually very few well-chosen words. The book is only 200 pages long.  Oh to be able to write like this!  Mr. Bezmozgis' prose is spare, elegant, descriptive and concise.  This book is a well-deserved 2014 Giller Prize Shortlisted novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KW8AK86M2H70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2AVVVO#wasThisHelpful","R1KW8AK86M2H70","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book provides an unflinching look at the lives of two sisters who grew up in a small Mennonite town in Manitoba.  Elfreida (Elf) is the oldest and the most mercurial.  She follows her dream and becomes a world-famous concert pianist who plays concerts around the world.  Yolandi (Yoli) is six years younger than her beautiful sister, and her life leads her to more traditional roles.  She marries twice and has two children (one from each husband). We meet these two sisters when Yoli is in her mid-forties.  She is in the process of getting a second divorce, and she's raising her two children on her own in Toronto.  Elf still lives in Winnipeg with her husband, but she has done something that has brought her sister and her mother to her side.  Elf suffers from severe depression, and she has just tried to take her own life.  The close family and extended family are all brought together to rally by Elf's side.  We meet Elf and Yoli's mother Lottie, their favourite aunt Tina and Elf's husband Nic as they all try to understand what has happened to their beautiful Elf.  Ms. Toews depicts the incredible heartbreak and sadness that severe depression brings to all members of a family, not to just the one that suffers from the condition.  Yet this book is not sad and morbid either because the humour and strength displayed by all of the characters in the book provides a sense of hope and acceptance throughout.  Elf and Yoli's mother is wonderfully depicted.  She has always disagreed with the Mennonite way of life, and even went on to pursue a career in social work after she had had her family.  Her and her husband allowed their lively girls to pursue what they wanted to, even if it took them outside of their small community, and even if it resulted in the public disapproval of the elders in their community.  Lottie's pragmatic look at life and her strength and sense of humour reminded me so much of my own late mother-in-law.  She too was a tiny, strong woman who met life head on, and who refused to take anything sitting down. There were many times when she gave me the strength to fight another day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6K41Y8ZXWBS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL3OJ4I#wasThisHelpful","R6K41Y8ZXWBS6","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Appropriately I read this book over the Hallowe'en season.  It is a very well-done ghost story with a little human interest which is revealed piecemeal through the characters in the book - both living and dead.  The big old house in the book is as much a character as the people, and the two long-dead ghosts in the house speak to the Walker family through the house and its rooms.  It is an interesting way to reveal a plot, but this book does it through the observations and interactions between the two ghosts.  The Walker family is there to bury the father of the family and to empty out the old house.  It is a troubled family with an alcoholic mother, a nymphomaniac older sister with her six year old daughter Amy and a sixteen year old troubled boy who is the one that seems to hear and communicate with the ghosts in the house.  The book is quite well-written and moves smoothly along.  It is a collection of narratives from the point of view of everyone sharing the house including the ghosts.  Family secrets are uncovered and an explosive ending puts the old house out of its misery. The book, even though it is about the paranormal, keeps a sure foot in reality and in human feeling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUDMCTBJ7XCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062223194#wasThisHelpful","R2YUDMCTBJ7XCI","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a book that was recommended to me, and when I read that it was set around WWII and steeped in the jazz and be bop movement that was popular at that time, I just couldn't resist it.  When I found out that it was also a book that made the 2013 Giller prize long list and was nominated a Globe and Mail Best Book, I knew I had to read it.  The book is about much more than WWII and the big band and jazz era.  It is a book about families, and father and son relationships.  It's a book about Canada and how we differ from our neighbours to the south.  But the more we're different from them, the more we are the same it appears.  I did not realize that Canada had it's own civil rights movement even one hundred odd years after the American war between the States and Emancipation Day.  Even today there are many people living in Canada who deal with race and cultural issues on a daily basis.  We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go to achieve true equality in this country.  This book shows us the anguish of children and people trying to fit in,  through the eyes of one little boy.  This little boy is 18 when the story opens, but in flashbacks we see this confused little boy as he grew up in Windsor, Ontario.  We see his anguish as he determines that he has to escape his family and home life in order to find a place where he might finally feel like he belonged.  We see the family that he leaves behind as they struggle to come to terms with the needs of this their youngest child.  A young girl from Newfoundland is drawn into this family drama because she meets and falls in love with Jack.  When she goes with Jack to visit his family home in Windsor, Vivian comes face to face with a Jack she never knew existed.  Her life is forever changed, and she must find the strength to deal with the new reality that has come to her life.  This is a book that definitely made me stop and think.  I enjoyed it very much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4989R56WIRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQZ6EF2#wasThisHelpful","RS4989R56WIRU","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tough slogging through this one.  First I must say that I'm a huge Fidelma fan.  I have read all of Peter Tremayne's Sister Fidelma books, and I usually love them.  Tremayne's mastery of his subject and his knowledge of the erra (1st Century Ireland), plus his innate storytelling ability have kept me coming back to this series again and again.  But I must say that I found this one tough to get through.  I found there was far too much ancient Catholic religion rhetoric in this book.  And even too much ancient Ireland history mixed in with it.  I got totally lost and worst of all it made me lose interest in the story. It seemed the book dragged along until about the final quarter, and then it finally picked up and was more like the Fidelma stories that I have come to love. There is a lot of death and dying in the book, but that is not unusual for these books, but the reasoning behind the destruction was murky and remained murky throughout the book.  In fact it was quite convoluted, and made no sense at times.  I still gave the book 3 stars though because I love the way Tremayne has developed his characters.  Fidelma and Eadulf are one of my favourite crime fighting duos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YW1GDJ2CUO3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKFTHBI#wasThisHelpful","R1YW1GDJ2CUO3R","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was totally unexpected for me.  It's so far off of my usual genre that when I first began it, I didn't know if I would finish it.  Well that would have been criminal.  I did finish, and in fact I devoured the book.  It is a post-apocalyptic story.  The world is decimated by the Georgian flu, and the story slips back and forth from before the flu and after the flu.  The Georgian flu came unexpectedly and left death in its huge swath.  A small number of people managed to survive, but they are left with a very different world.  The story is connected by the story of a traveling symphony and the extraordinary people in it.  After the flu finished civilization as it was known,  this itinerant bunch of actors and musicians travel from town to town  (not cities because by that time there are no cities left in the world), putting on Shakespeare's plays, all with a musical score provided by the symphony members of the group.  Even though the book is disturbing and very dark, there is so much hope here as we follow the post-apocalyptic lives of the main characters in the book.  The book depicts the incredible strength of the human race in the face of unspeakable disaster.  This wonderful book is so many things at once.  Yes, it's distopian, but it's about love, humanity, tenderness, survival and strength.  It was a totally wonderful book, and I have to say that it is the best book I've read so far this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZQRK6NWKPHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353308#wasThisHelpful","R15ZQRK6NWKPHI","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tempe Brennan finds herself reliving a very unpleasant case from eight or nine years previously.  It was a case that her and Andy Ryan had investigated in Montreal.  Numerous young, pre-teen girls were abducted from their homes and their bodies were discovered months later. It was obvious from the remains that the girls had been imprisoned and tortured for some months.  Ryan and Tempe found their killers.  One was caught, but one got away.  Anique Pomerleau evaded the net that was cast out to capture her.  Now in Charlotte, South Caroline, other bodies of young, pre-teen girls are found.  The circumstances of their deaths is different, but the similarities are too conspicuous to be ignored.  Tempe and Ryan are on the hunt for the monster who is Anique Pomerleau.  The book goes from Charlotte to Montreal to Vermont and back to Charlotte as Tempe and Ryan try to find this woman who kills young girls.  The similarities of the new abductions and killings to the abductions and killings in Montreal, have Tempe on edge and strangely feeling like she is an observer in some macabre play.  It was a joy to see Kathy Reichs back to her old writing self.  I thought this book was like reading the earlier Tempe Brennan books.  It moves along at a cracking pace, and the characters are wonderfully drawn.  I almost had given up on this series, but I'm glad I decided to give it one more try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQ7QBQOH6W54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544013#wasThisHelpful","RMQ7QBQOH6W54","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had such high hopes for this book.  It's not that the book isn't good, it's just that it wasn't quite good enough.  I enjoyed Ms. Burton's style of writing, and her knowledge and understanding of her subject (seventeenth century Amsterdam) is impressive.  I really enjoy it when an historical novel is as well-researched as this one so obviously was.  But there is such a sense of unrelenting hopelessness in this story.  I tried to look for a tiny glimmer of hope and light, and could not find it anywhere.  The characters are mostly well-drawn, but a lot of the time I found there was a lack of humanity displayed by the characters in this book.  I just couldn't warm up to them.  And the one character that I hoped would tie this story together and that would bring some humanity into the main character (Petronella), never appears anywhere.  The book is about the miniaturist, but we never meet this person and we never find out why or how she discovers the information that she requires for the miniatures she creates. We learn how family secrets can destroy a family.  We learn that we never should take anyone at face value and we learn a lot about what life might have been like in Amsterdam at this time.  This book would get five stars from me if there hadn't been so many loose threads left hanging and if there hadn't been such a sense of hopelessness and sadness.  I read to learn about different places and different times.  I read to increase my knowledge of subjects that I have not been exposed to before.  But most of all, I read for enjoyment, and for the chance to find that silver lining that is usually somewhere in a novel.  There was no silver lining at all in the unrelenting sadness of this book, and I was puzzled as to why the miniaturist never becomes a real character in the book.  It is because of these two things that this book rates as four stars for me,  instead of the five stars that I was expecting after reading the reviews about it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16G8UG9XTI8SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062306812#wasThisHelpful","R16G8UG9XTI8SR","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my Deborah Crombie! This book you've written is something else!  I love this series, and I absolutely love Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James (Kincaid) and I always love the mysteries they are trying to solve.  I was thrilled to hear from Deborah herself that the BBC is thinking about making a television series based on her books.  I hope that they do - the main reason being that it will expose more people to Duncan and Gemma, both in their personal as well as in their professional lives.  For those who don't know, both Gemma and Duncan are in the CID in London.  They work in  different stations, but there are lots of times where their open cases are connected in some way.  That's not really the case in this book, but each is working on a case.  Duncan has been newly transferred to another station, and is trying to break in with a new team.  A horrific incident occurs at a nearby train station (St. Pancras station) and Duncan is tasked with finding out who caused the explosion and to determine why it happened. He calls on his team as well as Doug Cullen from his past team and Melody Talbot who works with his wife Gemma to help him solve this particularly gruesome crime.  As usual Ms.Crombie has us wrapped up in her tale and furiously turning pages to find out what happens next.  And also as usual, we get particularly intimate glimpses into the personal lives of her characters.  It is the latter that makes these books so special.  But shame on you Deborah for leaving us all hanging at the end of this book!  Now you had better get writing and quickly so we all can find out just what is going to happen to Duncan and Gemma.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7PGTF8RLFVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062271601#wasThisHelpful","R1F7PGTF8RLFVH","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3/12 stars for me.  It would have made 4 1/2 but the book was at least 100 pages too long, and the last 100 pages really didn't need to be there.  I have to admit that I skimmed over them.  The rest of the book was captivating. The characters are wonderfully drawn and that was a wonderful book that is part supernatural and part science fiction.  This type of book is way off my wheelhouse, and I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I had heard good things, so I read it anyway.  David Mitchell writes a thriller of a book (for the first 500 pages anyway).  It was a book that had surprises on every page and every page read made me want to hurry and read the next one.  Holly Sykes is a wonderful main character.  We see her at the beginning of the book when she is a precocious 15-year-old, and follow her through the decades until she is an old lady in her seventies.  Because of the breadth of this book and large amount of time it covers, I found that it actually skipped a lot of back story that I felt was really required.  I felt like I had been left hanging many times while I was reading.  The whole story actually hinges around the disappearance of Holly's little brother.  He disappears never to be seen again when he was about seven years old.  It affected the whole family terribly, and Holly the most as she felt responsible for his disappearance.  But that disappearance also grounds Holly and it does not allow her to be swayed by plenty of negative influences in the course of her long life.  She finds that she is a conduit for psychic phenomena and so many unexplained things happen to her that she knows that a lot of what's going on within her is not within her control.  I love the other characters as well.  Mitchell does a great job of creating a fantastic mystical world that carries his readers away.  Now back to those last 100 pages.  They were so dark and upsetting it was like reading a futuristic ""Silent Spring"", a book which I never enjoyed at all because of the total bleakness of the scenarios it created.  Expect the unexpected though, and be prepared to be entertained by this door stopper of a book if you decide to take the plunge and dive in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0PJPCDVWJSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IW4XVF2#wasThisHelpful","R3W0PJPCDVWJSB","A1N1YEMTI9DJ86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N1YEMTI9DJ86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use Vitamin D3 to help strengthen my bones.  Being over 65, bones have a tendency to become brittle and susceptible to osteoporosis.

Vitamin D3 is essential to your bone structure.I currently take another brand of Vitamin D3 but thought I would try this out as it has more IU's than the current brand that I am taking as it has only 2000 IUs.

"Once I got into Once Shadows Falls, I couldn't help but compare this book to Silence of the Lambs.  It reminded me a lot of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter only with Beth Sturgis and Pell as the characters in this book.  Ms. Sturgis goes to the prison where Pell is and interviews him and there begins the parallels with Silence of the Lambs.  To me the only difference is that the serial killer is a lot worse than Hannibal Lecter.But if you can put aside the parallels with Silence of the Lambs or if you have not read it, this is a good book to read.  Tons of suspense, thrills and chills that will keep you reading and a few twists in there.

"I really needed a new cat tray for my cats and thought I would try this one out.  So far, I have had several issues with it.  I know my cats are a bit on the hefty side but I think this cat tree should have been able to handle the cats.  But the tree is unstable and wobbly unless you prop it up against something. I put it together correctly too and that went smoothly but the upper tier with a cat in it is top heavy.Another thing is that there isn't a scratching post on the tree.  My cats are pretty much shredding the velour fabric when they scratch but they do like the softness of the fabric.  The cat tree is an okay product but it is unstable and I think the base needs to be a bit wider to avoid being wobbly.  Also needs a scratching post of some sort.  Possibly the center ""trunk"" should be of sisal for scratching.

"I think I have tried all the cleansing towelettes there is on the marker and by far, Burt's Bees Facial Cleaning Towelettes are the best!  I didn't know Amazon Prime Pantry carried this item and was so surprised when I saw them and at a very good price that I had to order some extras.  The towelettes leave your face smooth and soft and is so gentle on your skin.  The scent is very light and pleasant and not overpowering.  They remove makeup, dirt, grime and every day stuff that gets on your face without a problem.

"As a first time reader of Simon Toyne I was very impressed by his writing.  Lots of action and thrills to keep you turning the pages well into the night.  I could not put this book down!  I found myself reading it through breakfast, lunch and dinner (good thing I live by myself) and hated going to bed at night.  The Searcher has a bit of supernatural/paranormal overtones which just adds to all the bad guys in this book and there are plenty of bad guys.Solomon Creed, the main character kind of reminds me of another main character in a series and that is of Aloysius Pendergast in the Preston/Childs series.  Tall, gaunt, albino and full of surprises.  I guess this will be a series of books and I plan on reading all of them.  I have not read his previous series of books, but I plan on buying them and reading them.  If they are anything like The Searcher I'm sure I will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KF0IFTT07YWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","R3KF0IFTT07YWV","A1IH7O6EL7SNBD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH7O6EL7SNBD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally found a battery that is as good as Duracell but only less expensive.  Last year I was given some Amazon basic batteries to try out from a friend.  It has been almost a year since I installed the 9 volt batteries in my clock radio.  I use the radio most every night and it runs on batteries and the 9 volts are still going strong.  The Duracells I have purchased in the past last almost a year and the Amazon batteries are better.  What is also a big selling point for me is the price of these batteries.  So very inexpensive and they are long lasting.  I finally broke down and ordered some 9 volts for myself and I am very pleased with the batteries and the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AP23R7A0A8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH4QM1S#wasThisHelpful","R7AP23R7A0A8I","A1IH7O6EL7SNBD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH7O6EL7SNBD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think you need to understand where you are in the journey to know if this book is for you.  The part of the book that is for everyone - motivation.  This book definitely pushes you to stop making excuses no matter what your fitness level is.  There are also some very interesting recipes included.  So, for those two things, I believe that this book would be worth the money.  For the rest of the book, it really depends.  I think a lot of people don't realize how out of shape you can get.  There are some negative comments about the chair exercises being for ""my 80 year old mother"".  Well...that is what makes this book great.  It CAN be for your 80 year old mother.  But if that is too easy, step it up to the next level.  It just gives you ideas.  I actually love the section on chair exercises.  I work long days and commute about 2.5 hours a day.  I sit waaaay too much.  But that is my life.  But now I have some ideas on exercises that I can do in my chair while I am on a conference call.  Will it get me in great shape?  At my level of fitness, probably not.  Is it better than sitting in my chair like a lump?  Absolutely!  And for that, it is totally worth it.  Appreciate this book for the little nuggets that you can use and the fact that it is meant to help a large population.  If you are looking strictly on a get in fantastic bodybuilder shape then the workout program is probably not for you.  But it can spark ideas that will lead you there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQPZJ47AZVB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316380962#wasThisHelpful","R2CQPZJ47AZVB4","A1VK6EKINVYAT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VK6EKINVYAT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dumb but Lucky!: Confessions of a P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II (Kindle Edition) are the detailed recollections of Lieutenant Richard Curtis. Working from a carefully maintained personal diary the reader gets an honest record of one mans experience of being a fighter pilot.Lt Curtis arrived in the Italian Theater in Spring 1944. He was part of a detachment of replacement flyers sent to the front with a shocking lack of training. He had never before flown in a P 51 nor had he any real training in combat flying.  Within a matter of weeks he would be the last of his group of 12 to still be flying and being lucky he is alive to tell his story.Arriving when he did most of the air war was over. His theater while more active than Europe would be, at least until the Normandy Invasion, was one wherein dogfighting with Germans would be rare. This is not to say he was never in danger or that his contributions are any less praiseworthy. He returns home having earned combat medals such that that there can be no question of his honor or right to respect. What is most praiseworthy about Dumb but Lucky is neither the constant self-depreciation practiced by the author nor the open way he speaks of his love for his soon to be wife and growing commitment to his Christianity. What Richard Curtin does best is to remind the reader that war is not a matter of glamour of heroics. It is about day to day boredom, the stress of the time in combat and yes even the wear  on a pilots bladder and bottom.What comes across is his love of flying, his motivation for revenge as well as his need to earn the respect of people, at home and in the unit. Yes he has a taste for hijinks. He can be blind about some of the unnecessary risks he takes. At some point one might think he would relate this attitude with the need for a fighter pilot to have some tendency to be reckless.Dumb but Lucky conveys an honest personal recollection of this mans war. The man deserves a respectful hearing.For all of this I cannot recommend this book as one of the better oral histories of WWII. It is a good antidote for war as a glorious crusade but there is not much more to recommend it. Warriors know that much of their time is spent fight boredom and isolation. Readers can have a limits for how much this reality might be enjoyed vicariously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUQ80TWC63O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XUADEA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUQ80TWC63O6","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:The last time I read something as well written as Dame Rebecca Wests The Fountain Overflows; chances are it was the last time I was reading another book by Dame Rebecca West. The Fountain Overflows is book one of her trilogy covering the Aubrey family. This volume gives us the family as young children until they are almost ready to join the world of adults. I believe this is the book Louisa Mae Alcott wished she could have written when she wrote The Little Women books. In fairness to Ms. Alcott her intended audience was children. Ms. West is writing to intelligent adults.The Aubrey family consists of an older sister, twins, one of whom is the narrator, and a younger brother. Their mother had been a promising musician who gave it up to raise her family their father is something of an influential member of the press and political thinker. The family is very long on ideals, standards and beliefs and very nearly on the wrong side of the border between genteel and crushing poverty.Rose Aubrey as narrator is precociously intelligent, deeply insightful and imbued with the kinds of survival techniques necessary to hold body and spirit together despite being constantly on the edge of financial ruin. Among the children the biggest single source of friction is the oldest daughter Cordelia. She is, as are they all hard-working, good, and cooperative but she believes herself to be a violinist with a future as a professional musician. An opinion shared with no other member the family. Rose and her sister Mary work extremely hard under their mothers extremely strict guidance to become pianists. They each assume-mother and twins that their future and family fortune will become secure as soon as these two assume their rightful place as concert pianists. The younger brother always referred to as Richard Quinn is everyones darling. Throughout this book he will appear to effortlessly play music, entertain the family and create instant friendships with most of the people who will come through their large but otherwise shabby home.It can be very frustrating to read about these prissy, opinionated and judgmental children. Over this one has to admire their keen awareness of how the events initiated by the adults above them control their fates. Having only lived just barely in front of financial catastrophe they have developed a highly evolved work ethic and survivors spirit that allows them to accept and make the best of the largely bad fate that has been their lot. Ultimately I found myself respecting the strength and unity of this family and its commitment to values over things.What keeps this book from being a maudlin tail of the noble poor or a melodramatic story about poverty is the innocent wit and keen insight granted to Rose. At one point the family chooses to take in distant relations who are the innocent survivors of a murder case - their mother had killed the father. Into their home comes the orphaned daughter and a somewhat hapless sister to the accused woman- we will know as Aunt Lily. Aunt Lily remains steadfast to her sister even knowing her guilt and when the time comes is regular about visiting her in prison. It is Aunt Lilys belief that if she is brought to the prison by a gentleman she and her sister will receive more respect. In describing one of the gentlemen who takes a turn providing this transportation is described by Rose as follows:He could have taken and Lily to visit her sister and brought her back without a tremor to his hound jowls, and done it not because he sympathized with her passion for her sister but because he still felt tenderly for her as one of the ugliest women he had ever seen and thought it was a shame.Towards the three quarters mark the girls of the extended Aubrey family had me very frustrated. Dame Wests resolution and conclusion to this novel turned me around. Its not just that she resolved and brought forward the completed the story, it is that she did so in a way that left me apreciating that I had just read not a book but literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUPOFVHOZLWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSZU24K#wasThisHelpful","R3NUPOFVHOZLWY","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once upon a time, television was new and the comedy variety show was king. Among the teams that made this a fact was the comedy great Sid Ceasar and a team of comedy writers never before or since assembled in one place. In Caesars Writers a brace of some of the best-known names to have first served an apprenticeship on either Your Show of Shows and/or Caesars Hour are gathered to reminisce repeat some of their favorite bits and tell you how it all got started. These are decidedly not grumpy old man even if they have not entirely lost the desire to one up each other.Caesars Writers is billed as a presentation of the writers Guild of America, West. If this is an example of the quality of their work I am going to seek out more DVDs from these folks. The facilitator of this on stage presentation is very clever at keeping himself in the background and providing just enough push to keep these guys going. Of course with the manic energy of the Mel Brooks there is rarely a need to keep them going. The more famous names like Larry Gelbart Carl Reiner and Neil Simon contribute as you would expect of these greats. Prior to the show I had not realized that Neil Simon had a brother Danny likewise I did not know that Sid and several others of these writers had enormous respect for heretofore unknown (to me) brother to Sid Caesar. And so it goes for a very fun two hours. I spontaneously correct combination of historic fact and personalities enlivened with repartee and comedy from the best in their class.The obvious shortfall to this writers reunion is the practical impossibility of getting all of the still alive writers to be present on one stage at one time. I cannot be the only one hoping that a second effort will be made if only to get similar input from those unable to make a commitment for this day.Caesars Writers is highly recommended as a family friendly, to our fun time. You may not have known anything about the original show or the original broadcasts but there are names on that stage that should have meaning. If you are not the kind of person to pay attention to who wrote, directed or produced your various entertainments, the good spirits in the easy laughter of these men will more than repay your investment in this DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZTCGQWFA2S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LOLQ5W#wasThisHelpful","R3UZTCGQWFA2S1","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Between age, allergies and allergy meds, dry skin has been a progressively bigger problem every few years. I do not have rashes or scaling or medical problems that require fancy solutions. The itching can be distracting and even wake me from deep sleep. Having tried many alternatives Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream addresses all of my needs with the least side effects. The tub seems to me as the most efficient container and the most flexible for application.Specifically what I like:Fast reliefLittle or no residueNo FragranceRelief without slathering on large amountsMy back is an area that gives me problems, the cream in the tub will adhere to an applicator (I think mine was a kind of plastic icing spatula) and allows me to apply to unreachable places with no dripping or wastage.No other product I have tried is close on all the above criteria.Cetaphil is widely available. Evan at Amazon I have seen wide variations in prices and some of the higher prices do not come with free shipping.  Shoppers do your shopping. What is in the 16 ounce tub of Cetaphil is the same everywhere.

"What makes Phineas & Ferb: Star Wars better than just any F and P collection is one of the best satires of the Star Wars movies. The song In the Empire, alone is worth many re runs. And so it goes most scenes following onto or expanding from very convincing animations of the original movie. A list of my favorite small bits world run almost as long as this too short and yet just right, brilliant family friendly satire. This is perfect for your most beloved SW geek be they young in years or merely young at heart.For me this one segment more than provides the value for this CD. But Wait! There is more! The addition of 5 more  hour P and F episodes make this a rich vein of entertainment for the family. Your choice to run it back to back or to spread it over several time slots.  To be honest, not all of these episodes held to the higher standards of humor I expect from this series. In no particular order:The Steampunks episode had great promise and a few good laughs, but could have been better.The Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror made for a P and F reply to the Simpsons Treehouse of Terror Halloween specials. This episode took me into a world of Phineas and Ferb for which I was not prepared, but was a lot of fun.Tales from the Resistance only works if you have seen the earlier episode introducing the brothers and their sister from another dimension.Doof 101 makes stars of some exploring bugs and characters I hope get some small time in more episodes.And finally there is For your Ice Only a fairly typical P and F episode meaning funnier than most animations targeted at the kids but not esp the best of the boys.The P and F folks made a point that Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars is  only a send up  based on Star Wars Episode IV , some of the rest are in desperate need of comeuppance, GO for it Team!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJ2O48H8AXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMPB62M#wasThisHelpful","R3AJ2O48H8AXV","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost exactly 100 years before Mark Twain gave us his travel book, Innocence Abroad; Laurence Sterne made this a popular genre with A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy. The Grand Tour of Europe was in its early years and was mostly for the wealthy. Sterne made such a trip and having met the grumpy Tobias Smollett he made this much lighter reply to those who could not manage to enjoy their travel. In an aside he dubs Smollett: Smelfungus condemning and satirizing hi co-traveler.For this narrative Sterne creates a body double for himself, the Rev Yorick, as in Alas Poor Yorick, the man of infinite jest disinterred in Hamlet. The typical travel book of this time concerned itself with the fine arts, museums and churches. The Rev Yorick cannot seem to avoid more or less innocent entanglements with a new lady almost every day. Married as our traveler is he seems to spend much of his time walking with pretty young ladies. Wither he is checking the pulse of a beautiful grisette in her glove shop, with the passive, passing approval of her husband or he tumbles into bed with a fille de chamber. This is not Moll Flanders or Barry London. That is the Rev is not making a Rakes Progress. Our hero is a man given to flirtations but, if we are to believe him no thought to engaging in a tryst or an affaire damour.Be advised that there is much untranslated French throughout the text, including a letter he copies from a drummer to a Corporals wife. It is clearly a billet doux and one wonders how he can use it without understanding its scandalous intent.A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy is something between a short story and a novella. Its abrupt ending is something of a pun. Sterne makes reference to his earlier work: Tristram Shandy, leading some to imagine it as a sequel. This is a standalone bagatelle. Light of heart and like the earlier work mostly pointless. This is what we expect of Sterne and he is so good it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S20OGO936AH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082ZBXS8#wasThisHelpful","R1S20OGO936AH5","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My copy of Not Enough Room to Swing a Cat: Naval Slang and It's Everyday Usage Hardcover is not an Amazon verified anything. I bought it at the U S Naval Academy Visitor's Center Gift Shop. This will be the first of several such reviews that allow me a chance to suggest that this is a great place to be a visitor. Annapolis and USNA have lots to enjoy as you walk around. Yes I am an alumni, but you need not have a direct connection to enjoy Annapolis and USNA.Not Enough Room to Swing a Cat: Naval Slang and It's Everyday Usage is an amusing and fairly well researched, if casually documented collect of expressions. As the title suggests, the common link between the items selected is a presumed, known or possible connections with traditional, modern or at Royal Navy usage.The only reason for a serious scholar to get this book is as a gift for friends who might come to understand get the fun in trying to seek out the origins of many common phrases. The point is, this is a small book with modest aims and taken as written Martin Robinson deserves credit for achieving his goals.Read Not Enough Room to Swing a Cat: Naval Slang and It's Everyday Usage Hardcover as a light weight recounting of possible origins of terms your Navy friends toss about. Depend on it for more than bluffing your way in a bar bet and you are on your own. Many origins are traditional rather than fully documented and the entire field of origins is fraught with best guesses, conflicting versions and scholarly equivalents of bluffing.  Martin Robson has saved you some time in narrowing the field among these alternatives and for most of us that is enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC61XFF1RL7KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591146275#wasThisHelpful","RC61XFF1RL7KB","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not an Amazon purchased product. I learned my lesson paying the higher price at Whole Paycheck. Education can be costly.My immediate and visceral reaction to Epic Bites: Bison, is that it lacks anything like a bite. The mouth feel, as they say in the biz is that of a stale crumbly cookie like thing. The flavor is vaguely sweet and otherwise unpleasant. The packages does not say it is a jerky but the PR claims that this is about serving your needs for something meaty. Crumbly is not the term that comes to mind when I think meaty. Whatever flavor Chia is supposed to add, nothing about tasting this product made me think of nuts... well not the flavor of nuts anyway.This was to be a one star review but in reading the rest of the hard information some credit may be due. No Nitrates/Nitrites, as in uncured bacon; carbs plus sugar is a reasonable 10 and for preserved meat the sodium is not that high. The product is advertised as gluten free. I do not expect gluten in preserved meat. Maybe they could add that the package is gluten free? The price seems to be gluten free and maybe the ink is too. The use of raisins for sweetener is a good idea, but the flavor of raisins did not survive the pressing process that is too obviously the manufacturing technique in use.The carefully worded claim is that the Bites are made WITH 100% natural Bison. Imagination fails at the problem of 100% Unnatural Bison. Since no claim is made about the rest is the bacon, chia or raisins, 100 % bacon, chia and raisins, or some mix of natural , artificial and fake?I did not enjoy Epic Bites: Bison. If it is supposed to be for sophisticated meat eaters, I think it is a fail. Flavor is not a selling point. It may be a relatively healthier choice for the fan of jerky meats, but It will not be a future choice for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZ8HPAJBPU3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFDL3HE#wasThisHelpful","R3KZ8HPAJBPU3O","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it was Christopher, the first to post an Amazon review of this the Kindle Edition of Views and who brought it to my attention. I got it on the theory that much of Henry James can be too densely written for my taste, but that I wanted something by him I could finish. This taste has whetted my appetite, and has confirmed my cautions.This short selection of reviews by James provided me with more quotable material in fewer pages than any writer this side of Shakespeare. By the end I was fighting my way through needlessly convoluted sentence structure and a notion that Henry James really like to hear himself.In an early selection he describes a writer as: ""not offensively clever"" a wonderfully clever turn of phrase.He has little good to say of Walt Whitman saying of him: "" He tell us in the lines quoted that the words of his book are nothing. To our perception they are everything and very little eat that."" Nicely written burn.What exactly are we to make of:"" ...the critics taking notes as we may in the interests of truth, George Elliot belongs in that class of pre-eminent writers in relation to whom the imagination comes to self-consciousness only to find itself in subjugation."" Say Whaa?For at least 2/3 of this brief selection I was in a state of astonishment that Henry James could use such a vast vocabulary with such precision. And then... and then. James will often scold a writer for phrases that ""Smell too much of the candle?"" a lovely way to describe an obviously forced but intended to be casually remark. Yet James's reputation is that he would labor over his texts only slightly more than he expected of his reader.I will be reconsidering writers such as Kipling, given the adulation he receives in this collection.  I am all the more leery that Henry James can write with too much smell of the candle. Further he can be complex for no obvious reason except to fill more space on the way to making a point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SU53FO2LGY9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UFXKZW#wasThisHelpful","R1SU53FO2LGY9X","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line first:Like the best of most cartoons, there is something in Phineas and Ferb for the supervising adults and for the kids.  Plotting can be complex with several story lines going at once. All is in good taste, and family friendly. The best punch lines are typically from Dr. Duffenshmirtz the hapless and ineffective mad schemer. The two boy tease the imagination with their inventiveness and almost all age groups and personalities get a share of the spot light. Great family time fun with a rich enough mix of visuals and jokes to survive more than a few viewings.This is not your ordinary Disney and the association is more by accident as the production company was not an original Disney product. Having made for themselves a happy home at Disney the makers of Phineas and Ferb have created their own cartoon conventions. Each segment can be filled with at least three story lines. The boys and their neighborhood friends invent everything from a 20th century re-boot of gladiator games to a portal that takes them to Mars. Their older sister switches between trying to get their generally oblivious parents to punish the annoying younger sibs and her awkward efforts to attract the boy of her dreams. Meantime their pet, Perry the Platypus is Secret Agent P who job is to figure out what the Evil Dr Duffensmirtz (Owner, operator and president of Duffensmirtz Evil Incorporated) is up to and foil it.Side note, since when does an evil cartoon villain have a teen aged daughter , an ex-wife and a driving need to take over the Tri-state area?As Senator Claghorn would say: If you're listening, you're laughing. The dialogue is what truly drives these cartoons. The plotting tends to be too rich, and filled with too many visual elements for most people to get everything in one viewing. In other words you get more viewing enjoyment for your dollar.Why only Four stars. I am a fan. But the writing can be uneven. You can find yourself longing for some bits to end so an episode can get back to something funny. Usually this is between the Dr. and the Platypus (and when have you last seen those words in the same sentence?). The parents being oblivious is something of a cliche, esp in a show that tends to avoid them. The father I something of a dork besides being oblivious, but he tends to be as inventive and quirky as his son and step son. But this is a happy choice, I recommend it and I will be collecting more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPFE6AYD3PA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KRCDRU#wasThisHelpful","RVPFE6AYD3PA2","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line FirstSecrets of the Flesh; A life of Colette is over long. The scholarship is excellent. Ms Thurman is at her best giving her analysis of Madam Colette's extensive library, but the biographer cannot tell the difference from significant, or illustrative events and tittle-tattle. Overall this is a good book. There is too much book and not enough of it is important.++++++++++++++++++++++++++Early in Secrets of the Flesh Author Judith Thurman tells us that her subject, Colette may have invented the modern teenager. Her subject is self-indulgent, moody, jealous and given to causing jealousy.  These details may be sufficient to validate the case, but Ms Thurman does not define what she means by so categorizing Colette and which of these characteristics prove the characterization.This same woman was a prodigious writer, novelist, autobiographer, reporter, reviewer, and playwright. In short there were very few applications of the written word that carry no examples of Colette as a superior performer. When not writing, and she was almost always writing, she became an actress. Not merely a woman of the stage but a performer at the leading edges of the field, even where the roles required nudity.  Meantime she had at least three husbands (one would become head of the French government and a major player in world politics) and scandalous for her affairs with men, including much younger men and women. There would be few secrets of the flesh unknown to Colette, but one suspects many secrets of the heart that eluded her.As much as the book title emphasizes matters of the flesh an as much as Colette's life and writing revolved around matters sexual. Ms. Thurman can be rather prissy. Leaving it to your imagination may be the academically correct alternative, and indeed Colette herself was never overtly pornographic but the readers should not have to read between the lines about who is having affairs with who. Colette could be very wounded by the many infidelities of her various husbands and lovers, except that she frequently was involved in infidelities of her own. Including infidelities with the mistresses/lovers of her husbands and lovers. All rather complex and occasionally calling for the kind of specifics that Ms Thurmond avoids.The breath of Colette's authorship is as vast as her romantic entanglements. This biography is at its best when time is taken to consider these writings. Ms Thurman shares with us insights and opinions that clarify the context of the novelist and the shades of meaning as one moves from French to, in my case English. I am most grateful for those parts of this Bio that help me relate the author to her words.I am least grateful for the nearly endless recounting of the many parties, homes and other social engagements of this important and well connected woman. There are too many pages given over to these visitations and listing attendees. Madam Colette lived a complex and productive life. She is worthy of 500 pages. More of the pages could have been devoted to the product of the author and less on how and with whom she dined.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CN6ORB6TWM5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345371038#wasThisHelpful","R2CN6ORB6TWM5Q","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First: Shop around. DVDs come in and out of print and even out of print there has to be some good prices somewhere. 8 Acclaimed (British) Films is clearly for fans of modern British movies, esp then up and commers like Collin Firth and  Hugh grant as well as grand dames like Judy Dench and Vanessa Redgrave. No Jane Austin here but much in the way of literary refinances and history costume dramas. These are not something for everybody movies. You much like intelligent dialoged and subtlety and slower pacing. Evan the lessor of the movies here have fine performances and superior costuming and some amazing beautiful settings. Where they fail it is directing.<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<DI'll not review all 8 movies in this set but I will comment as to what struck me about most of themTo start with the low moment. Tom and Viv is a film biopic of TS Elliot and his failed first marriage with the well-connected Vivian. William Defoe gives us a highly intense TS Elliot, by mostly never saying , doing or emoting. This is one seriously DULL poet. There are huge gaps in the narrative and we never know how much the marriage failed for lack of hormone treatments of because well the British Aristocracy had no ability to cope with metal derangement among their own.Restoration has its moments, and both Meg Ryan and Robert Downy Jr perform ably enough. After one or two surprises early in the movie the rest is too nearly predictable. Not a bad movie, just not as interesting as the costumes and scenery.THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN is a fun enough movie mostly a true story and Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant except before we knew his  bumbling charm is his acting trademark.A MONTH BY THE LAKE is the almost mandatory almost chick flick about older people falling in love. Charming and Redgrave is marvelous.I almost came to hate My Life So Far, but the last ten seconds of the movie are save it. It is also a biopic, but these people are more likable.Sweet Revenge is the English version of Throw Momma Off the Train, less brash and just as pleasingly silly Helena Bonham Carter is as crazy as she usually is only funnier. Still I missed Ann Ramsey.There is no reason for you to be reading any of this if these topics and this generation of British film making is not your cuppa tea. 8 Acclaimed Films has enough quality movie time here for most of the people who have chosen to read this far. Find a copy at a cost you can accept and plan on at least 650 of 800 minutes to be good movie watching, all with fine acting and beautiful things to look at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AI6KXQUDR3BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080QOL10#wasThisHelpful","R2AI6KXQUDR3BE","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:""Robert Galbraith"", AKA J. K. Rowling rose to fame by writing what the British used to call rattling good yarns. The Silk Worm is a good yarn. This is a solid addition to the tradition of the private detective who honestly figures out who done it. Everyone is a suspect. The police, here called the Met get it wrong. There is an obvious red herring and the clues are there for the alert. The problem of proving the solution leaves the reader in suspense to the final reveal. All of this is the within the traditional formula and it is to the author's credit that we ride the formula aware of and indifferent to the formula. ""Galbraith"" passes the tests of being entertaining, and of not cheating the reader from having a chance to solve the case. A good read.????????????????????When we last saw the budding team of Cormoran Strike and his sidekick/ fellow private detective Robin Ellacott they had just solve a very high visibility case involving the murder of a super model. Now that the firm has some money and the additional cases load born of good press; Strike accepts the case of a missing writer from a dowdy wife, much burdened with a mentally challenged daughter.The team soon finds that the writer is widely despised and the author of a book taunting everyone he knows. Technically everyone he knew because we find him the victim of a gruesome murder accomplished in an overly detailed crime scene. The game is not so much afoot as hanging.With the Silk Worm we have two detective stories set in high profile media related industries.  A third novel is in the release process and we soon learn if this will be another constant milieu for the  older, more cynical ex-military investigator and the fast learning , fast driving back up .  The information is that he will always have to deal with a local police force that resents being shown up by a civilian.All of these details create a sense that we are seeing behind the scenes. Witness to the private world of the media elite. Strike has connections via his past military work and through his father a successful (rich rock star). Always we are privy to the secret world of the connected.On the other hand, Galbraith/Rowling is not handy at building suspense or a sense of danger. Her stories tend to move along in a simple trajectory with a minimum of risk and the day to day details of getting a job done.Early on Rowling realizes that the daily rituals of a burly single man with one leg are not things we need endlessly reported. Filling this space is, fortunately, more about the story. The author simply lacks an edge. Her heroes lack the money for a true British Drawing room mystery so they are scruffy and slightly down at the heel. The story remains mostly gentile. Strike seems to be a capable brawler, maybe one day we will have him in a brawl.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YY5AH4B2X0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJJUIOM#wasThisHelpful","R28YY5AH4B2X0O","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Marina Lewycka's A short History of Tractors in the Ukrainian is an interesting variation on the immigrant story. It has a reputation as a funny book. I find it hard to laugh at a story about a family that barely survived the German occupation of the Ukraine. The surviving father has brought a younger, obviously dishonest abuser into the family house. Meantime the emotionally damaged daughters struggle to protect not so much their father but their mother's memory while barely able to relate to each other. This is a complex story handling history, politics and psychology all woven into a meaningful and occasionally entertaining read. This is not a light comedy. This is a mostly serious story, tinged with the ridiculous. IT is good story telling.?<>?<>?<>?<>?<>?<>?The father around whom this story revolves is an elderly Ukrainian World War II survivor, an engineer who could have been a contender and is now a befuddle old widower with a confusing passion for a low class, buxom Ukrainian schemer. His two adult daughter recognize that this woman is a threat to their father and a disgrace to the memory and artifacts of their now dead mother.There are family secrets. One may explain the cold practicality of the older sister. The younger sister has accomplished a P.HD and a good marriage but retains the insecurities of an immigrant and her conflicting social, socialistic attitudes.One is tempted to call this a `chick flick"" and shrug it off as more complaining by women about breast obsessed men. It even has the predictable women uniting to deal with linger health issues. But Ms Lewycka goes beyond these cliched trappings to discuss the real horrors of surviving less famous aspects of German occupation. The father is a fool but he is also a good engineer and has more than a fixation on a woman who snared him with the promise of sex only to become a physical threat to his life.The risks and problems of deporting a dangerous alien from England and the attendant bureaucracy is believable and provide additional suspense about the outcome.The final resolution is unexpected and rewarding. There were time I was angry with the narrating daughter's (Nadezhda) inability to stay focused and committed to her goals, but hang in , all will be resolved; just not the way you might have predicted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2388XPN4T740S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QUEHNK#wasThisHelpful","R2388XPN4T740S","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure:Having recently viewed and reviewed Beat the Devil I was gifted this copy of a used edition of the Book Beat the Devil. Thank you to my friend.Bottom Line:Claud Cockburn's Beat the Devil is something of a comedic noir novel, a dramedy from before the term was invented. It is neither that dark nor that funny but it is a pleasant read. This is a slightly padded out adventure story of a group of petty crooks hoping to make a big score in Africa minerals. They are stuck in a small French town as their ship undergoes emergency repairs.  Here they meet up a British couple with their own plans to make money in Africa. Everyone, the adventurers, the ship's crew, and the various lessor supporting characters is at some level not up to their respective positions. The humor arises from our expectation that someone in this motley crew will get it together long enough to pull off a caper.  The punch line is in how many ways they are not up to their own self-image.:?:):?:):?Reading the Introduction by the author's son, one gets the impression that a biography of Claud Cockburn would make for a superior read. The author had been a dedicated communist for much of his life, not abandoning his radical politics until after WWII. As such he had written under at least 5 names and brought up his family on the edges of poverty. A family joke was that they were so poor because of the 5 different writers they were supporting. This book would give them a taste of the benefits of capitalism one wonders how the family reacted to the gradual improvements in their condition.Beat the Devil is one of cockburn's early fiction novels from after he gave up his communist passion. It is relatively free from politics and mostly focuses on human frailties absent any real rancor over them.One of the best and most illustrative moments of his gentle humor is early in the book. One of ""the Committee"" of crooks is attempting to get a secret telegram to friends who will get background info on the British Couple. The telegraph operator, a man of no official standing shifts into stereotypical French Bureaucratic mode and begins to question the would-be crook. He is a German, with the name O'Hara, traveling under an Argentine passport (This is just after WWII) attempting to send a telegraph in code. O'Hara falls into stereotypical German Imperial hauteur only to collapse into equally stereotypical submission to authority. Very nicely done and absent any heavy handed editorial or invocation of economics, class, or the rest of the possible propaganda.Hired as the go-been, the man with the connections and the ability to get past officials is Billy Dannreuther. Think Rick, from Casablanca, only the war is over and Billy is never able to pull of the big score or attach himself to a cause that is both righteous and successful.  He is the center of the novel and we, the readers and the adventures and his various friends from the past, look to him to keep everyone moving forward, alive and closer to their respective fortunes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5Q5P1O88ODP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0701205822#wasThisHelpful","R1H5Q5P1O88ODP","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Ring Lardner's Gullibles Travels is a collection of 1920's era humor. He may have had a good ear for mid-western accents but his over use of that language and his over use of what may have been common expression can make for difficult reading. His narrator has a jaundiced outlook, penny pinching attitude and a wise acre manner of expression. It can get to be too much for too little. The plot twists do not provide much comedic tension. This is a short collection and is the better for this fact.{}{}{}}}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{Ring Lardner was an author of light humor from the average guy point of view.  He writes in the tradition of Mark Twain and Damon Runyon. Gullible, that is the narrator of these few short stories is the husband of a would be social climbing woman and her husband seeking sister. While he seems to have the time and money to indulge his wife and sister-in law, he regards every demand on his pocket as extravagant (unless it is for his drinks) and trusts no one, except his bartender. This is not the world of flappers and pre-crash brokers, these are working people in the bare middle class of Middle America,Lardner is capable of some very funny comments. He describes a skinny man as so thin that ""were his collar to fall over his shoulders he could step out of it.""  On the other hand he describes his sister in law in a bathing suit as looking like ""an upside down Y'- not as clear as the statement that a person is ""all Longitude and no latitude.""Damon Runyon who also wrote at about the same time invented the street language of his Broadway ""Guys and Dolls"". Yet I find his speakers easier to understand and more creative in their use of slang expressions. Lardner may have done a better job of recording the spoken language of his time and place, but sometimes it limits his humor to his time and place.Gullible's Travels, Etc. is my second selection by Ring Lardner. This book added little to what I can expect from his line of jokes and variations in plot. I suspect there are better examples of his work but it may be awhile before I return to find out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YRYYPZ1S8AE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TRE9GG#wasThisHelpful","R19YRYYPZ1S8AE","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Six short comic misadventures forming a light read. A Man of Means is humorous rather than raucous. For a Wodehouse fan such as myself this is a collection completer of material often hard to find in paper copy. Mine is a Kindle copy.  This may make for good bed time stories for the almost to early Harry Potter aged child. As an adult reader I enjoyed these stories but I know PG can do better.;0Wodehouse's six short tales of a traveling Innocent, Roland Bleke is our Man of Means. Having been co-written with C. H. Bovill and first published as a magazine serial 1914 they are from after the period Wodehouse would call his apprentice years. So neither exactly early Wodehouse, but neither is it from his prime.There are several aspects that make these connected stories unusual. Unlike many of his earlier books the main character is a young man, not a school boy. There is nothing about boxing or cricket. Unlike many of his more famous stories Roland begins as a working man of few means and no connections. He will come into money and find that this is a mixed blessing. Across six brief stories, barely totaling 90 pages his money will get him into troubles including those he comes through while being oblivious.

"The Universal Cell Phone Flip Case is a pretty decent phone case. I have a fairly low end flip phone about 0.75 inches thick and about 2x4. It fits snugly into this case but not so much so as to make it difficult to draw. After a few weeks I have some words of caution:The case uses a belt clip. Generally not a bad thing, but the case will never be so firmly attached to that belt that it cannot be knocked loose. Most likely while you are running, or in my case bicycling. The elastic that grips your cell must give out at some point. Given the very reasonable price, the solution is to buy a new one.The addition of a strap over the top of the cell would solve the elastic problem and a full bet loop would answer the problem of the clip. A flip phone case of this type is what I would prefer, and have not yet fond.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUIBHSIC3EZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PIHG9U#wasThisHelpful","R1XUIBHSIC3EZ4","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line first;Not my favorite Danial Pinkwater preteen novel. The lead in is as good as his best. The payoff was something of a let-down. It is a tight bit of storytelling; meaning that there is little in the way of complex plotting , and therefore not much padding. Start to finish in a brisk 157 pages. Note my copy is the hard back NY Review Children's' Edition. Absent one relatively unnecessary reference to a woman's over use of cleavage it is family friendly. This is a minor bit of satire that may have some parents re thinking this selection but over-all Lizard Music is a good choice for bed time or for the 9-12 Yr old readers. Likely boys will like it better than the girls, but mostly because the main character is a boy.PTPTPTPTTPTPTPTPTPTPTPPTPTHaving just finished a classic pulp who done it, Lizard Music impressed me with Daniel Pinkwater's ability to draw you into a mystery that does not require the usual violence or high risk threats that even the old Hardy Bros, Nancy Drew mysteries tended to employ. Our hero a 12 yr old tells us the story of the previous summer when he had a few weeks, home alone. He lives in a small town near Hogboro on the shores of Lake Mishagoo. (Most of the intended readers will get these references so let's not spoil their fun)  Unaccustomed to late nights and getting to indulge his taste for anchovies on his pizza, he finds himself watching very late night TV , after the end of the broadcast day. The surprise is that after the local station s, all of them sign off he can watch a very fine set of performances by a band of musical lizards.Herein are a number of problems for the modern readers. The copyright for Lizard Music is 1976. Pre Cable. Younger readers will not know abot things like the end of the broadcast day. Likewise Victor is a fan of Walter Cronkite and Daniel Rather and these names, likely will carry no meaning. The description of a Lizard game show: ""You Bet Your Duck"" is one of the slickest bits of humor in the book. And likely no reader under 50 will `get it'. My solution for this is to have the parents do the reading and be ready for the questions. The Groucho Marx game show via u tube will serve as answers for the parents who missed the original broadcasts.Solving the Lizard Music mystery will take Victor into Hogboro where he will meet the Chicken man and his performing chicken Claudia. This aspect is one of the classics in children's books. I like most kids had that one unexplained experience in a strange part of town where you met nice people but experienced something out of the normal. The store you can never find again. There are the people behind the counter who helped you and helped you to have an adventure. This happens to Victor, it is vaguely unsettling for him, but exciting and in the end rewarding.For me the resolution of the mystery is not as exciting as the visits to Hogboro. There is magic but it is not that magical. We get some idea of Victor's reaction to this visit, but what is supposed to be a Pinkwater version of the land of Oz is not that spectacular.Beside is his sister one of the Pod People? Yes we have a homage to the Day of the Triffids, but that is a thread left unresolved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDBDQIR2VG6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173872#wasThisHelpful","R3NDBDQIR2VG6V","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 1945 the radio show Burns and Allen: George Burns and Gracie Allen to you youngsters introduced the Character of Senator Beauregard Claghorn, voiced by Kenny Delmar. That character is pretty much the entire reason for this movie. The same character will be immortalized as the cartoon Foghorn Leghorn.Bottom Line: Lightest of lightweight humor. A very young June Lockhart and some other people do various things so that the not yet senator and his dog can have a movie. By the numbers we have a little romance, some fun with elderly ladies, a comedic dog, a young neighbor boy who does not know booze from fruit juice and generally a set of set ups for the star to turn into jokes. It starts strong with all the asides that make the overbearing, kindly Claghorn worth watching. The introduction of thugs (from Yankee land of course) is supposed to add some dramatic tension. Mostly the drama is forced and some of the jokes predictable. Never mind this is a good time, family friendly, and the way they used to make them.The best advice is from Beauregard himself: If your listening you're laughing, laughing that is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSKPS178TBV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002HODO0#wasThisHelpful","R3PSKPS178TBV1","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line first: This is one of several Lekue microwave cooking items we have. We like them all. BUT they are all flimsy in construction. You may want to hold off buying them until you have held one. If after you get the feel of this steam case you still want it; we like ours. But we have learned how to use it safely.{_}{_}{_}{_}{_}The Lekue 1-2 Person Steam Case has become one of the most used cooking containers in the house. Steaming is a very healthful way to cook, no oils needed. Steaming is very heat efficient. Obviously this is moist heating so it is hard to dry out your food. We now cook dim sum (Chinese dumplings) about once a week and have been very satisfied. We have used it with vegetables and we know it can do more.  So-why only four stars?The construction of this and most Lekue products is very flimsy. I have learned, the hard way to only use this product with a plate under it and to only handle it by the plate once it has been in the microwave. Spilling boiling water is an experience you do not want to repeat.The Lekue 1-2 Person Steam Case is very easy to clean but I do not trust it in the dish washer.Get to a store and handle this or any other Lekue product. They take some getting used to as most will flap about if given the chance. That said we have about 3 different items from this product line and we like them all. All of ours were bought at a nearby sore in part because it is better to handle them before buying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVCFH15R2LMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2UU8WU#wasThisHelpful","R3GVCFH15R2LMZ","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two Fisted Science is listed as the work of several graphic artists and writers. The back cover would have you believe that the purpose of the book is to help readers see scientists as humans. At best this is partially achieved.We get a more or less fictionalized retelling of Galileo's problems with the Catholic Church. This is followed by a completely fictional ""bar fight ""between Newton and Leibniz. Leibniz is shrugged off as a Lawyer when in fact he was a lot of things.The several sections on Richard Feynman includes the touching story of the tender love between himself and his dying wife as well as something of his mischievous sense of humor. Likely this section comes closest to capturing the person in the lab coat. Feynman also has the largest share of this short book. Bertrand Russell get a fairly clever and effective one page. Until you read that this is a version of a story based on something else. On the good side each section ends with some quality suggestions for additional reading.As a collection of graphic art there is something here for everyone who admires this art form but the text/story lines include too much that is vague and unenlightening and too little that is of human interest. If any scientist profiled in Two Fisted Science was unknown to you before reading the book, likely they remain unknown to you nor do you have much that tells you why a given scientist is profiled.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7ZQ3R06F77F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0978803744#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7ZQ3R06F77F","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:I enjoyed reading Hedy's Folly. I cannot enthusiastically recommend it. There are several versions of this story so it cannot be argued that this is hidden history. I would not have known that author Richard Rhodes was a Pulitzer Prize winner based on this sample but to his credit he did keep me amused. The Actress Hedy Lamarr and her co-inventor George Antheil himself an accomplished composer, writer, and polymath, came into contact with a variety of the important people in a generation of experimental art,  the movie industry on two continents and in Hedy's case arms merchants.  That is, there is a lot of legitimate name dropping. In sum this is a fast easy read, some interesting back ground but in every respect lite weight.%|%|%|%|%|%|%|%|%%|Perhaps because I got my copy at a huge discount, I can say that I got fair value. The construction of the story of Hedy's Folly is rather casual rather than academic. Her life story traces her first as daddy's darling in upper crust, post war Vienna, to her her ill-advised marriage to an extremely wealth arms merchant and some little about her career first in European theater/cinema and later in Holly wood. At barely 17 she swam nude and acted as what we would now call a liberated woman in Ecstasy and later in America she would be the woman to first hear the now almost forgotten line"" Come wit me to ze Cazzbah (note it must always be spoken with an exaggerated French accent)On a parallel path there is the biography of the highly and broadly talented George Antheil. He was an impecunious somewhat self-indulgent composer of experimental ballet and symphonic music and eventually a contract composer of movie sound tracks. It would be in this role that the two would meet.Besides shared interests in Europe, common languages and music, the two would combine skills as inventors and between them give to the US Navy a patented design for technology that would be promptly ignored for decades. The importance of this invention would be re discovered and is now a part of much of modern cell phone and internet transmission.There are numerous gaps in this story. Rhodes is very unsure how much Miss Lamarr knew about weapons, and radio control and how much she had memorized from dinner table conversation. Both she and Antheil are called inventors but neither person seemed to have done much more than act as part time tinkerers. Their patent was real and had it not been given to the Navy and under strict security control it is possible that both would have been famous for their discovery, Alternately their version as specified in the patent  was not that close to the versions now in use and perhaps they would not have survived challenges.Lamarr was apparently much sinned against by her various husbands, and various they were, but is it possible that she too took a liberal attitude towards the marriage vows.Ultimately this is a friendly biography. There is little depth on any topic and effort is made to restrict the negativity or inquiry. This is history as a fun story and not as an exercise in investigation or analysis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YA5P7N0AVVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MF1BS2#wasThisHelpful","R24YA5P7N0AVVB","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Mo Yan attempts much in this sprawling novel. There are some threads about survival, the impact of modern history on peasants and Chinese peasants and Communism and War and...trust me a huge bucha stuff.  There are flashes of brilliants and tiny ants of problems. One gets a real sense of the arbitrary and violent nature of life in last half of the 20th Century in remote North East China. The use of magic realism can be lyrical and unsettling. Jumps in time and space are confusing, as can be the jumps from first to third person. It has been suggested that this may not be the best translation, but this one has not left me with much interest in re-reading a better translation of Big Breast Wide Hips.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%The novel begins with Mother (Shangguan Lu') giving birth to her only son and her eighth daughter. All conceived outside of her marriage to an impotent and generally weak husband. Meantime the family donkey is struggling to give birth to a mule-(technically a hinney). The matriarch of the family is mother in law to the woman in labor is far more concerned about the threat to the family livestock than to her daughter in law who has so often failed to produce a male. We will get flash backs explaining something of Shangguan Lu' treatment in her husbands We will get some idea of poor farming life in the edges of North East China, village politics, the status or lack of same for women, ties of family, hints about who and why Shangguan Lu has so often mated with different men and also the invading Japanese army is about ot arrive. And some people are about to die.  Our central character Shangguan Jintong is born and we are not yet to page 50.With more than 90% of the book to go it suddenly become 1900, or about 35 years earlier and we get  detailed flash backs with the details of Mother's life before the opening chapters. We learn she had undergone foot binding (in some detail)  in an effort to assure her a rich marriage. This ancient style was about to be over taken by the changes that are only beginning to be the norm in China. And we learn about how her mother-in-law will push her into seeking fathers to get her with male child. Then we are back at the scene of the birthing and history resumes.Between sisters, their husbands, and various cousins, the cast become both large and unwieldy. Death will arrive in many froms, sometimes suddenly and often graphically. Survivors become scattered and many characters will disappear only to return often more than once and you can never be sure which ones ae to be favored by fate.At some point an American, named Babbitt arrives. Likely he is an OSS /Army operative tasked with channeling support to the Nationalists effort to fight the Janpaese. He will marry into the family, and disappear and this is only one of many sub-plots that fizzle into nothing.And there are still over 300 plus to go.I wanted to like Big Breasts Wide Hips. I took it up on the recommendation of someone who knew I was looking for some non-western literature. The arbitrary nature of village life feels real and the slow increase in the status of women, the possibilities of modern and sophisticated life are left for you to track and evaluate. Long passages have the power to draw you in and give you the sense of living this life on the edge. Then comes the jarring changes in time, space and person. And then the scenes with no connection to the rest of the storyJintong, the center of the story is not a likely character as a Chinese Everyman. His lifelong fixation on nursing at the breast does more to de-sexualize the breast since the anatomical drawing in Gray's Anatomy. His encounters with sex, especially his first do very nearly the same to the eroticism of sex. We have reason to believe that Jintong has talents, and that he never gets to use them because of his uneven luck. He is a good observer, and a good choice to be the center of the narrative, but he can also be aggravating and inconsistent.And so it goes. Sometimes powerful writing, sometime the narrative is as simple as the people described. China lurches into modernity but not so much the peasants.  Ancient superstitions and village prejudice defy sophistication. And at irregular intervals the narrative jumps and continuity is lost.By the end I was grateful to be done with Big Breasts Wide Hips. Glad to have read it and leery of trying to ever read it again, I do want to read more Mo Yan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1HK99B73M87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611453437#wasThisHelpful","R1L1HK99B73M87","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:The London Review of Books is home to some very high power serious writing. It is almost exclusively for a sophisticated and concentrated reader. As a place to find book reviews that concentrate on the more important books both newly released and those worthy of reconsideration the LRoB is all of that. Ultimately it was too much for me in terms of the books selected and the time given to each one. OTOH there were rarely enough books reviewed. The LRoB also covers the arts and British and European politics. Again this coverage is very intelligent and at much greater length than even most American Newspaper tend to allow. I admit to being over my head, but I was also unhappy with the way book reviews were often such a small part of the paper.>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<My subscription seemed to take months to start. Since then deliveries tend to be several in a row then none for more than a month. Since it was taking me so long to read a copy, I liked having more than two weeks between deliveries. As is I have 4 issues stacked awaiting my time and mental energy.In terms of the quality of the writing and the depth of insight, the LRoB is five star. My decision to subscribe was based on an interest in books and in the craft of reviewing. Instead I have more on politics `across the pond' than I can or care to follow and a relatively few overly long (for me) reviews.As such my three stars are more subjective than usual. The magazine is consistently high quality, and just as consistently contains less than I was hoping to get. If you prefer to read reviews that are at the graduate school level and are almost as long and as researched as graduate level papers, LRob should be a happier choice for you. For me this was too much work and not enough about books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V167SMBQF5Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005N7XF#wasThisHelpful","R2V167SMBQF5Q5","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FWIW The CD cover present on the page as of 7/22/2015 is not the same as the one in my hand. Mine says nothing about Funk. Mine looks much like the cover of the other volumes in this sequence and I suspect there has been some kind of crossup..Now that I have collected all four of these ISIRTA CD volumes, I find that I still want more and am not sure (Jedi gesture) these are not the CD's for which you are looking.Some of the best sketches are here in. Cleese doing color announcing for a comedy stage play is manic as on Cleese can be, and it's funny. The idea of doing a sporting event broadcast style announcing for a theatric has been done in several variations. PDQ Bach has a version running over Beethoven's Fifth. This is funnier.Several CD have variations on names into puns: Introducing Mr. and Mrs Larzseny and their son and Daughter, Grand and Petit (Pause) Larzseny. Pause for laugh or groan. In this set we are introduced to the classical playwright Euripides and his sister IdaRipidoes. Ida wrote the slightly less famous Oedipus Rex and his Red Hot Momma.In some of the other disks, this much quoted material might have exhausted the best material. Here the jokes come faster and if not better at least funny enough to get you off balance.If your only getting one I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, none of this set might be your best choice, but Volume 3 is the best of this lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6OZSBQJY92F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140567766X#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6OZSBQJY92F","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Sarah Vowell's collection of essays, The Partly Cloudy Patriot, published in 2002 represent her voice as she was coming into her 30's.  This is my lead thought as I try to give you a bottom line first. She is at her best when facing a central fact of how great it is to be an American. We achieve great things, often by cooperation as a team and by obeying government. But we are most American when we disagree, do not get along and act suspicious of power. In her best essays she is touching, humorous and almost teary eyed about her country. At her worst she can be too focused on herself as a nerd, her status as a liberal policy wonk, as a city slicker and almost all the usual white female worries excepting body image. I wonder how she will write when she grows up.WWWWWWThe Partly Cloudy Patriot begins with a wonderful essay as Ms Vowell attends the annual battlefield reading of the Gettysburg Address.. By the end, The Wife , myself and some folks who let me quote to them had been moved, laughed aloud and had some serious things to ponder. Not bad work for an 8 page (I have the Hard Back editions with fairly large print) essay.In a later essay she will investigate a campaign lie that was told about her candidate, Al Gore. She goes to the source of the misquote, establish the correct quote and the context of the quote; then names the reporters who got it wrong before pointing to the television commentators who abused the misquote. For many this would have been enough. Being partizanshe could have blasted the evil mindedness of those who made this misquote into another hammer on the victimized Gore. Instead she presents the misquote in context. Meaning that Gore had placed himself in a position wherein reporters stuck following him about would be inclined to hear him wrong and not think to check. The world of politics has devolved into an ever more divided, take no prisoners, admit no error world. In the Left/Right divide of 2015, one wonders if she would still put in the extra effort.Returning to Gore the candidate in another essay she will explain that part of the job of a political candidate is to entertain. Actual knowledge of the subject, beyond a Trivial Pursuit level is often unwanted. Better a president you could swap stories with over a beer than one with a complex understanding of complex issues. Perhaps this is  over simplified, but Ms Vowell's conclusion is that Gore needed to have been a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There he would have learned to be more chary about letting people see how smart he was.She makes the case for the underground lunch room at Carlsbad Caverns. She agrees with The US Park Service that it was a mistake and gets between the visitor and a more authentic experience of the natural world 700 feet down. But she argues that the mistake tends to make the experience more a human one and if possible more exotic. My own thought is that the lunchroom may have served ""real food"" , that is locally cooked food by people using individual imagination and local diner techniques. Now I suspect that the 2015 lunch counter has sandwiches from some nationwide distributor with no more personality than plastic wrapped meals in a low end franchise food outlet.What keeps these essays from being better is the semi-neurotic voice of Ms. Vowell. Her hang ups, her hesitations, her misspent youth crowd too many pages. Sometimes I felt as if I were scoring essays from some nation-wide student essay contest. ""What America Means to Me"". Perhaps now that she has traveled more, done more and experienced more, she has decided if she is writing about people and events beyond herself, or if her proper subject is herself. I like her better outwardly focused.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQRU6AV5PMTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SF575A#wasThisHelpful","R1FQRU6AV5PMTJ","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember hearing these broadcasts, actually rebroadcasts on Maryland Public Radio in the early 70's. I remember ISIRTA as the funniest and fastest  hour. The laughs came so fast I could rarely remember the jokes.These selections, not so much. I am 3 of 4 CD's into this set and yet to hear one episode of Curse of the Flying Wombat. I do know the team had a thing for Womabats, Gibbons and OBEs but nowhere do I find the little yellow dog. Much to my dismay.Paying attention you will hear the birth of many future Monty Python comedic convention. . John Cleese sounding officious and declaring a sketch too silly, he started that here.  On the other hand; exactly why they abandoned the licentious and large Lady Constance De Coverlet is a mystery to all who loved her blatant, if optimistic sexuality.The flow of extremes in English accents is at once a source of fun, as some are taken to impossible extremes, while other jokes get lost between the heavy layering of accents and a certain degradation of sound quality.Mostly I am a tad disappointed. The cast is here, the high speed puns, naughty suggestive jokes and broad satire is all here, but I suspect that broadcasts where chosen because they were most liked by the producer and not the best or most popular. Until someone with inside information corrects me I am going to guess that those broadcasts wherein the comedy team refers to themselves as Radio Prune, or Full Frontal Radio, they are not the team at their best. In those broadcasts, wherein the team refers to themselves as the Magnificent Six and a half I am betting the humor is better and more consistent.We agree with Mr. Angus Prune that we had a good laugh, just not as many as anticipated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEI49NDJM96J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405677651#wasThisHelpful","R2IEI49NDJM96J","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Patrick K. O'Donnell has brought together some interesting first person accounts of America's WWII military spy organization the Office of Strategic Services. His book Operatives, Spies and Saboteurs is a readable if light weight construction of what individual survivors did while undercover in World War II. For the casual reader, this is history absent any academic fluff or grand theory and filled with the deeds of men and women who acted heroically and are haunted by the excesses of total war.Partisans were rarely forgiving of Nazi's or their supporters and the Nazis remain as vicious as all other documents confirm.  Some readers may wonder at the stories untold because the speakers are long gone. Given the lack of attention to competing allied underground forces some of the claimed achievements are perhaps made by a friendly author rather than the results of deeper analysis.My conclusion Operatives, Spies and Saboteurs is a good beach read history and shallow to the point of distracting to the serious scholar.X><X><>X><>X><X><X><X><X><X><To the degree that Operative, Spies and Saboteurs honors the deeds and lives of people who took great risks and too often paid that last full measure it succeeds. History is not just for the experts and the detail curious. Accessible history serves its role by bringing to light the things people did, that people need to remember as a matter of respect.  There are heroes among us; no less so because they could not be famous even if fame was a reward they might have wanted.That said O'Donnell has little to tell us about allied secret services. He acknowledges the relationship between Bill Donovan as the founding head of OSS and Sir William Stephenson, his counterpart and agency mentor from `across the pond'. It comes as a shock when the OSS is joined by Italian underwater units (The Italians had some of the most effective underwater attack units of all the major national forces in WWII). A later story about the exfiltration of the virtually intact Finnish secret service was not recounted with sufficient detail. These people came with valuable information but there is little case made that the OSS or the US derived much benefit. Even worse the Finns delivered the information that would have allowed us to read important parts of (then Allied) Soviet coded messages but `officially`all related copy was returned to the surprised Soviets. (Copy being the operative word)The point of view remains with operating agents and we get little of the view from OSS headquarters or allied command. O'Donnell twice suggests that the German success at launching the Battle of the Bulge was in part due to a decision by First Army HQ to refuse OSS units the necessary operational permissions. This is two large statements,(The why for 1st Army's decision and the possibility of OSS detection of massing German forces) and worthy of much greater discussion. There is no such discussion.Among members of the military it is a matter of pride that this or that service branch is the first ashore or into a battle field. This book adds to this mix of chest thumping and exchanges of pride that sometimes the irregulars were there first and that the gleaning from their work was an increased survival rate among the fighting troops who arrived next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TH94HE1LJS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743235746#wasThisHelpful","R7TH94HE1LJS7","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because movies are visual, one cannot help but feel that senior statesman Donald Rumsfelt's face is against him. This once handsome man now presents with a faintly shark like over bite and a confident smile that tends to look like the stereotype of a used car salesman. Director Errol Norris refers to this smile as a tell, using the poker term for an expression that gives away another player's hand.Donald Rumsfeld gave his country decades of service much or it at very high levels. He served with both Democratic and Republican Presidents. He was briefly a presidential candidate and believed himself to be on the short list to be the Vice President on Ronald Reagan's ticket. Ultimately it was his service as Secretary of Defense during the last Iraq War that brings him to our attention.This is a respected man , more than just bright and I believe sincere in his desire to be of service to his country.Given his record as SecDef, it is hard to conclude that his sincerity and intelligence was enough.Rumsfeld was famous for his ""snowflakes"" constant barrages of memos requesting information, frequently the definition of terms. As Morris presents them , they show a man fixated on details and either not in command of the larger picture or determined to misdirect others.  He will warn that he most wanted to avoid a national Pearl Harbor moment and then has to explain 9/11.This explanation is a tell. He writes it off as a failure of imagination. The intelligence community had not the imagination to contemplate this specific type of attack. This was an intelligence failure and an organizational failure. The analytical problem is to collect the data that would tell us when , where and how an attack would come. By letting the data direct your analysis you reach your answers.That is there was intelligence pointing to an attack, and to an attack involving hijacked commercial aircraft. This information was lost in a system not well designed to promote the collection of the facts from disparate sources and  jurisdictions. It was not necessary for the Intel community to envision this specific attack, it was critical that reports from very diverse sources could not be coordinated. This was a long time error in the system and not one I can blame on Rumsfeld or his administration. It is telling that Rumsfeld feels the need to cover and obfuscate against the possibility that he and his would be faulted.At the heart of this documentary is a man who is confident in his ability to cover and obfuscate. The title, the Unknown Known is a reference to a long answer he once gave to the question,: What evidence do we have that Iraq was making weapons of mass destruction. He did not answer then and he leaves much unanswered now.Of the bonus material the reprinted analysis of Rumsfeld is the better material. The Director's discussion of how he made documentary is self-serving. This feature begins with a clip from the film wherein Rumsfeld responds to Morris question:""Why are you speaking to me?"" The response is "" That is a vicious question."" Later Morris will state that he had intended to be neutral toward his subject as that is the only way his movie could be done correctly.Given the cynicism of the day, does anybody believe this? Even if true is is self-serving. That Morris asked the question is an admission that he did not believe he was thought of as neutral. Rumsfeld's answer is cleverly evasive.The Unknown Known is a valuable document in trying to show us one of the important men in American Defense Policy. That we cannot be sure we have seen or heard the man is telling","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRJRFVKFWTXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV054FQ#wasThisHelpful","RWRJRFVKFWTXD","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line 1st: Beat the Devil is an occasionally comic movie about would be con artists and their women and what we are told upfront will be a thwarted crime. Despite a stellar cast the direction of John Houston and the writing of Truman Capote the bumbling is not comic enough and the drama is not compelling enough. There are some very fine individual moments which spread out farther between as the movie drags on. Not a bad movie but what a lot of talent to achieve so little. Good for a family movie night or a film buffs date night but maybe not something you will see over and over.><><><><><><><><><><><><Because there is been some discussion of technical problems with certain versions of this DVD is identified as the Collector's Edition from Eco Bridge Home Entertainment. Sound quality was for me excellent. For a 1953 film I found the transfer slightly washed but I am willing to bet my viewing experience on this DVD was superior to what most people saw in the movie houses almost 65 years ago.There are a number of lovely moments In Beat the Devil. Gina Lollobrigida walks into a room wearing an otherwise modest but on her teasing dress and announces ""tea for two""; earning the single biggest laugh in the movie. After that her character is mostly bland and could have been portrayed by any woman with an authentic Italian accent.The mostly invisible Peter Lorre receives some clever jabs based on the fact that he plays an escaped Nazi with the assumed name of O'Hara while living in South America. He will give us a lovely comic turn while delivering a homily to Humphrey Bogart. O'Hara, an underling henchman has been sent to a advise the Bogart character that it is important for people to avoid appearing suspicious even as Lorre is acting very suspicious. His character then mostly disappears from the movie having little more to contribute.Humphrey Bogart plays the most necessary man for the execution of the the crime but otherwise his character is a bland version of Humphrey Bogart as Rick in Casablanca.Robert Morley nearly makes this his movie. While he mostly portrays Robert Morley; his ability to be an overbearing but hollow and ineffectual bully nearly has him dominating the screen as he dominates his criminal conspiracy without ever impressing Humphrey Bogart.The pleasant surprise in this movie is Jennifer Jones. She sparkles and crackles and is very much the center of her every scene. It is given to her to leave out a trail of unnecessary and elaborate lies confusing and misdirecting virtually every other member of the cast. I'm tempted to say that her principal dialogue consists of alternate plot lines considered by Truman Capote and instead handed to her and brilliantly handled by her.The plot line is as neat a McGuffin as Hitchcock could have desired. But for all of its complexities and individual bright moments there is too much dead time in this movie with almost all of it piling up to stretch out the end. What we now know as the, comedy drama or dramedy would not be developed for at least 25 or 35 years. In its more modern formula there is a better sense of timing and of the mix of gag lines and danger. In 1953 the formula did not yet exist and so this movie has originality but it lacks balance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SHTJ85UG3PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005A0QS#wasThisHelpful","R22SHTJ85UG3PG","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Mistitled, muddled and contradictory. This is the story of making the 1958 movie: The Quiet American staring Audie Murphy, among others. There is enough good in the book that I do not hate it. I will consider some other titles by William Russo but not because this one is great reporting.VVVVVVVVVVVVVIt is fairly common for authors to have less than full control over the titles given to their books. In the case the case of William Russo's Audie Murphy in Viet Nam there is another books titled: A Thinker's Damn: Audie Murphy, Vietnam, and The Making of the Quiet American. Why the two books or two book titles is unclear. Same writer and about the same length that one 245 pages this one 232. This version is vaguely interesting but the title had me expecting a very different story. The other title is closer to what this book is about.The movie, The Quiet American was based on a Graham Greene book of the same name. The book takes place during that brief period between the French expulsion from colonial Viet Nam and the American debacle. It is a cynical and dark story. Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz made this in 1958 riding the power given by previous successful and important pictures.Audie Murphy was one of if not the most decorated soldier in World War II.  He had earned battle field promotions including commission on to the officer ranks and he had earned every combat medal the US Army could offer including the Medal of Honor. The war over he had taken to Hollywood to make movies. He was not known as a great actor and had only done B grade westerns. He never took the Hollywood as a life style, and had a low opinion of most actors and most everything related to movie making. To him it was a job and one he wanted to do well.He also returned from WWII suffering from what we now call Post Traumatic Stress. That is he had his demons and his issues, but Russo presents no evidence that Murphy brought those issues into his work.And so the contradictions and inconsistencies begin. We are told on a regular basis that the movie is a failure. A box office failure for sure but not very good otherwise. Except that Russo will maintain that it is good. Murphy is over shadowed by his British costar Michael Redgrave, except that Redgrave may have started to show signs of the illness that would end his life. And Murphy's scenes are actually quite good, except when they are not.Murphy arrived late In the Viet Nam portion of the shooting, avoided public contact and missed much of the location shooting. In sum, Murphy was not in Viet Nam for much time nor for much of the in-country portion of this book.The making of the movie is the center of this story, given the last pages of the book, the proper central personality of the book should have been film editor William Hornbeck.Russo could have written a better book. The many, ooo so many reminders that the movie would be a box office failure. It was disavowed by its director and leading male leading actors; facts not needing to much emphasis. There is some good analysis of the movie and of the performers, but too often there is contradictory analysis of same. Movies have people charged with maintaining continuity. Mr. Russo would have benefited by an editor charged with maintaining narrative continuity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXP6HGKRDMBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G28RYSA#wasThisHelpful","R2TXP6HGKRDMBJ","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is not trim. It will waste space on your power cord or wall socket. The rotating prongs do help make it possible to store it in a smallish space, but they are not mounted to give you the most space when in use.It feels flimsy and:1, There are cheaper and better designed alternatives.

"Most important is that Kingley Amis is writing about the Ian Fleming James Bond books. He is aware of the movies but he is only speaking to the books. He is also writing while Fleming is still alive and before the parade of post Connery Bonds. If all you know are the movies and esp the recent ones, much of what Amis discusses will make little sense.The audience for The James Bond Dossier are those who have or are in the midst of reading Ian Fleming's secret agent books. Parenthetically, one of the first things Amis explains is that Bond is not a spy, he is a secret agent. Being a secret agent is a more nebulous calling and is rarely about espionage and more often about , pretty much anything M assigns.Amis came into the literary world as something of a cynic, broadly critical and majestically sardonic. A clear purpose of the Dossier is to give `it' back to those literary professionals who had over analyzed and otherwise over stated the cultural influence or importance of these books. The short answer should be that James Bond is escapist adventure stories for (mostly) adult males. Fleming's goal was to create not so much a believable hero, but one that we (I am a fan too) would be able to blur into our image of ourselves and thereby share his heroics and his women. Bond has to be lager than life, virile and able to live lavishly. Such is how Fleming designed him.Here it might be fun to consider the adult male fantasy value of a James Bond and compare him to the pre-adult male fantasy value of Harry Potter. Perhaps under the title: My Name? Potter, Harry Potter.  Done as a serious comparative analysis might be to make the same mistake of those Amis systematically out analyzes those critical of Bond as Literature (Capital' L').This should have been a merrier book. As heavy as Amis can be in his humor, I was always looking for the wink, the nudge the acknowledgement that this is not intended as a serious read. Amis works very hard to document his points. He has a detailed table cross tabbing all the major points in every Bond book and short story. For example: here is the proof that the Bond Women arrive at an average of one per book. That is, Amis is better at documenting his conclusions that the other guys. This is a serious point.Mostly I enjoyed this book. Because of the Dossier, I am likely to re-read some of the Fleming books. Ultimately it became work to read and not the emery entertainment I would have preferred.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJYHEVNS8KF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FA992U#wasThisHelpful","RXJYHEVNS8KF7","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Originally published anonymously in the New Yorker Magazine under the name Constant Reader, this is a collection of chatty book reviews with a added observations on related cultural events. Ms Parker has a very fine, acid dipped pen and more. She is writing at a time when entire generations of American writers were new and not yet too admired to be criticized. Her opinions are usually very clear but rarely explained in any depth. Her preference seems to be the writer who writes be best sentences and gives us the most complex characters. This is a surmise because for all her skill with the literary put down, she is rarely clear about what she expects. Constant Reader is highly recommended- if you are looking for sharp wit but not if you are looking for statements of esthetic standards.Imagine being able to judge emerging writers like Hemingway and Steinbeck, as each new title is coming to the public. Never needing to be careful in the handling of a literary giant and being free to pick and choose from all titles not just those that make onto the required High School reading list. The 1930' was a time when America was experiencing the first productions of the great expatriate writers, the lost generation, realism and the beginnings of newer, more experimental novel and short story forms.Dorothy Parker was one of the writers of her generation. This means her column is not just the opinion of a trained reader, but of a person who has fought the battles to get published. Besides her standing as a poet, writer, and literary critic she was a member of the Algonquin Round table. This was a collection of hard drinking, eating and creative people. Talent and regular attendance at this New York restaurant were among the prime membership requirements. Dinners at the round table were expected to trade well-crafted and intelligent insults and to represent high levels of literary and acting talent. Ms Parker was so at home with this group that when invited to join with an inner-inner group for a several weeks long vacation at Alexander Woollcott's remote country home, she famously spent her time there wearing a hat and shoes and nothing else.Constant reader is a fairly slender volume containing about 31 columns. She might begin by writing about her mood , the weather or one newly published work, swoop down on something not too her liking and end with a third topic. The result is more like a conversation with an opinionated, very intelligent and wickedly witty person. Some writers are championed with such regularity that I find myself looking for them having previously low rated them as too obscure.  . Her praise for Ring Lardner short stories means I have added his name to my must reads. Neither Ms Parker nor I am fans of all Hemingway novels, but her belief in his short stories has me rethinking his body of work. She seems to think that Sinclair Lewis is less worthy for a variety of reason, but especially because of his over productivity.Other selections include her famous dislike of the Winnie the Pooh Stories (famous but I am not amused), a terrible novel by Benito Mussolini (from his years before politics) the occasional how to book (The art of successful Bidding about playing bridge) and even one about how doctors should deal with appendicitis (as a way into more literary discussions of new releases by George Nathan and James Stephens. If this suggests a wide range of interests, Ms Parker is wide ranging. If it cause you to worry about uneven columns, some are better than others. Ms Parker is fond of humor based on a long set up ending with an abrupt slam dunk put down. It usually worksConstant reader usually works. It will give you cause to smile, to feel superior and names and titles from 80 years ago that will be new to you. Her recommendations will be worth your time to investigate..","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZFDLOQX05C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067023916X#wasThisHelpful","R13ZFDLOQX05C3","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:One good reason for you to be looking at this collection is because you are a Gary Cooper fan. This collection has some of his earliest starring roles and some of these titles may be hard to find. You may be an old movie buff and these are certainly old. If you are looking for how they used to make `em, you may find one or two that are not what you took as given. The sound and video quality is better than reasonable and may be better than was first heard in the more remote movie houses. Were I to score these on the entertainment value of the 5 movies herein, I would say that three are very good, one is terrible and the fifth somewhere between. If you are not primarily a collector this is a 3.5 star collection.Reviewing the movies:Design for Living is a clever and sophisticated artist as bohemians' movie. For all its lack of nudity or swearing it is still a naughty movie. The design for Living has two artists sharing the same muse. She will be lover to each in turn, and she will have the chance to live in a conventional marriage. Hardly what people mean when they talk about the high morals of the movies from ""Back in the Day"". Good acting and some very humorous writing. The sofa that puffs dust becomes a great running sight gag.Peter Ibsen has Cooper a classic quiet American Actor playing a English architect in a highly romantic movie. His childhood love is now married to a wealthy, titled Lord. The childhood love is fated to draw them together and the two are fated to be apart. How much can love transcend reality?  Great acting and good writing keeps what could be a maudlin melodrama from cloying.The General Dies at Dawn. One of the worst movies I have watched in years. Terrible writing and leaden directing make this a slow motion train wreck. This movie is marginally watchable if you have a fondness for stinkers. William Frawley, the future Fred Mertz in I Love Lucy will play a secondary role as a perpetually drunk weapons merchant. Being drunk means he will be the only cast member excused from being wooden mouther of flat clichs. There will be one scene as most of the cast takes turns surprising each other in a room with a dead guy. Possibly the only scene in the movie worth watching, but only because its gets to be funny. Beau Geste, Cooper again as an Englishman. This is one of the great classic movies. The original Foreign Legion movie and the originator of many future movie conventions: The hated sergeant, the Foreign Legion as the place where nobody knows your name and the family fortunes hanging on a last desperate gesture.The Lives of a Bengal Lancers- The quintessential quiet American is cast this time as a too talkative Canadian born officer in an elite British regiment of lancers. Lets see we have a small detachment of elite European soldiers attempting to bring civilization to murderous Muslim fanatics, led by a British trained high living tribal chieftain and all in the high mountains of Afghanistan. (Actually North West India, but close enough) Nope too unlikely never happen, or...? Bengal lances is mostly an old war house of a movie, but it has its moments. Look for the great character actor C. Aubrey Smith. If ever a man looked the part he did. The classic British senior officer, esp if the officer has command in some remote and dangerous place. He face is one of the one you automatically think of if you hear the words British colonel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPLQ36KN0QAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007RTB9M#wasThisHelpful","R3LPLQ36KN0QAJ","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line First:Emily Yellin's Our Mother's War is one a several books claiming to be the first or only complete report on the many roles America's women's played during the course of World War II. Ms Yellin's version is well research and addresses a surprising long list . We have her take on Rosie the Riveter, but also the so called Good Time Girls.  She has the courage to include the special burdens placed upon black women, the Japanese internees and lesbians. The result is a wide ranging but not very deep reporting of what women wrote and said. There are relatively few titles that speak to the contributions of and problems faced by the different women who were by accident of birth or deliberate decision part of the American Female Experience of World War II. This book is a good book to start your readings on this topic.<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Mostly Ms Yellin write well. She is neither a trained historian nor a much published writer. Early chapters tend to have too many time shifts and it can be tricky to keep a time line under her narrative. Once she moves into the histories of particular institutions, Military Nurses, the Red Cross and etcetera she becomes bound to the sequence of events as that institutions experienced them and this problem is minimized.She is not a historian but she is writing from the heart. The good news is that her work is not dry and technical and she is sincere enough to let her story tell itself without dramatics. She writes as a woman and with a woman's point of view but what she writes feels honest such that male readers need not feel defensive or excluded. What America's women did, suffered to overcome and accomplished for themselves and for their country is an import part of understanding both WWII and the roots of the Woman's Movement.It is common knowledge that women had to overcome a variety of prejudices before earning the right to choose their own destinies. There are many places one can read about the ongoing problems of balancing home and work while fending off unwanted attentions getting the children to their various activities on time and in good health. Many of the details within these larger subjects remain political and garner various arguments. Can we at least agree that the persons who placed sugar in the gas tanks of aircraft to be flown by women (causing the death of more than one female pilot) are among the lowest of the low?  Can we speed this discussion by admitting that the routine tricks to keep women from receiving the same pay for the same jobs, the same chance at promotion were inexcusable. In the particular cases of women who also crossed the color barrier, can we agree that it was and is despicable that they faced life and limb risks only because race?By taking us through the variations from the women left behind ; caring for home and families that many of their men would never know, to the women who went to work in the farm fields and factories, to the women in uniforms and hospitals, in espionage and nuclear weapons development; we get a glimpse of the `many faces of Eve' . But here is only a glimpse. Ultimately, Our Mother's War is an introduction. None of these topics are exhaustive covered and there is very little analysis. Because this is a reader friendly book, one can finish it and feel that you have a sufficiently large scale understanding of the topic. A better result is that the reader will feel welcome to delve deeper into this topic and by doing so honor the diverse and war winning contributions of America's women.Our Mother's War was purchased by me at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas. As such it is not an Amazon verified selection. I paid the higher price for getting it at their gift shop, but I also get to support and remind you of this worthy museum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE460LIGAZO3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743245164#wasThisHelpful","RE460LIGAZO3T","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line firstColette's Cheri and the Last of Cheri delve into a world of people who exist on their surface qualities and measure life in terms of what wealth can buy. While focusing all of your attentions on what people are on the outside, you are subtly directed to appreciate the existence of deeper human needs. I am new to Colette, and I wonder why she is so much ignored in mandatory reading lists and in lists of modern writers.  Whatever the quality of the translation what comes through is mostly primary colors and hard talking people, who may not be what they project. This is literature and deserves more prominence.}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{{Cheri is a neglected, spoiled over indulged son of a professional ""kept woman"" Another of her generation and profession Lea had originally acted as a parent to Cheri, the boy and  by default  they become lovers. Book one ends with Mme. Peloux, Cheri's mother arranging a marriage for her boy to an equally wealthy and more respectable daughter of society.In the second Novella, Cheri is a veteran of the just ended WWI.  He now lives as an observer. His wife and circle of friends give themselves to what may be noble or greedy post war causes while he begins to react to his shallow and emotionless life.From the beginning we see Cheri (real name Fred Peloux) as more like an animal than a human. He is fascinated by comforting objects. The real pearl necklace of his lover Lea has always worn will become something of a running theme and telltale for judging other characters. Lea's Shoulder<?> is for him a symbol of safety and warmth.Certain themes will exist throughout the first book. Lea is always seen as in the last stages of her exceptional beauty but both the objects around her and her circle of friends will always be described as decayed, worn and having lost their looks and command of style. Everyone has money and money buys security but no protection from time. Cheri is mostly described as an animal. He is cunning; possessed of the survival skills he learned from the hired help. He has enough looks and money to be arrogant and hard to please. Never are we witness to his capacity for any of the nobler human traits. He can wound but he is the one who get mollified.In the second novella, Cheri dominates the narrative. He continues to prowl Paris and reacts to the surfaces, smells and physical traits of a world that is becoming too small. His wife could have become a love match for him, but she is absorbed in a world past him. She may have a lover, but she is still open to the possibility of marital sex in what has become a sexless marriage.The dedicated sensualist that was Cheri in book one has come to the end of his interest in things sensual. What he lacks is a vocabulary or an ability to understand anything beyond surfaces. His struggle with this problem is the conflict that will bring us to the end of these books.Colette is a master writer. That she chose to write about naughty people and without judging them as naughty may make her work unacceptable for middle or high school reading lists. In these two novellas sex is never graphic and language is never raw. My recommendation is that Colette deserves a higher place in western literature. I will read more of her books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDWRYPNVUTUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374528012#wasThisHelpful","R1XDWRYPNVUTUH","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So what is Chicory?The chicory plant is a salad green, slightly more bitter than Romaine. The root roasted and ground has been used as a coffee Extender at least as far back as Napoleon's Day in France. When the British and Allied Blockade, AKA the Continental System restricted the Emperor's access to fresh Coffee the French added chicory root to their ground beans and insured the right drink to match up with their beignets. During the American Civil War it became popular in the blockaded south and in New Orleans they never exactly gave up the habit.Coffee Extender?Once prepared, Chicory has a deep brown color and added to coffee grounds (Dark or French Roast recommended) it will give the drink a very dark muddy brown color and add slight thickness to the brewed cup. The flavor tends to be more intense and may take some getting used to. Chicory is added to the ground coffee in ratio that varies between companies around 75% coffee to 25% chicory. Meaning you just turned 3 pots of coffee into 4. BTW as much as Chicory adds to the flavor of the coffee, it contains no caffeine and is said by both traditional and modern medicine to have beneficial health effects.Combined with pre-heated Milk in the right proportions and you have authentic New Orleans Cafe' au lait. As for that Caf' Brulot and Caf Diable are such New Orleans traditions that done properly they are made in bowls and served in cups made only for these high powered adults only beverages. Either will leave your hotel blend coffee made ""Irish"" as a weak sister.Domestic TranquilityThe Wife like many natives of New O, esp those who grew up in the `Old Neighborhood"" knows her coffee. Give her the aroma and a chance to look at the whole bean and she will give you country of origin, and quality of the roasting/storage for that bean.  Never mind that Community Coffee, New Orleans Blend is mother' milk to her. Anything else simply `Will Not Do'.Of late she has become quit fond of her Keurig single cup coffee brewer- regretting only that until recently there was no plastic pre-measured cup at the ready to serve her steady drafts of New Orleans Blend.At Last Community Coffee meets Kuerig. That she can now have her New Orleans Blend made for her at the press of a button. Thus her almost every wish comes true. Now her thoughts turn to the multi-cup version of the Kuering...One last point: Please, Please, Please shop around. Your local store may have become sufficiently civilized as to carry this New Orleans staple in the K cup form. And this means no shipping and maybe a better deal.  There are many on line places that offer New Orleans Blend, including direct from Community Coffee. It is on you to insure you are getting the best deal.

"Ms Melanie Wiggins' Torpedoes in the Gulf: Galveston and the U-Boats, 1942-1943 was a book I selected in a small gift shop in the historic Strand District in Galveston. I expected something of a local history and to add some details to my understanding of the early months of America's World War II. In the first few months after the declaration of war neither the American people nor the American military was prepared for the German submarine warfare that presented itself so quickly and with so much loss of life. German submariners would refer to this as their ""Second Happy Time"" or the American Shooting Season.Having finished the book I am tempted to say Ms. Wiggins is not a professional historian but neither is she a poor one. Her work is unevenly researched and many of her conclusions however valid are neither properly researched nor discussed. The trade-off is that she includes detailed information from U boat message traffic. And by learning from many of the participants, she has preserved an oral history of the same months as they were experienced in Galveston.Hers is a German perspective of the submarine war. She carefully includes official pictures of most of her U-boat skippers"" and portions from many daily reports. She will occasionally shift her point of view from the German periscope to the decks and bridges of the vessels under attack. Some of these jumps can be jarring as she is rarely clear that this is what she is doing. Once you get the hang of these abrupt shifts there are not too bad. Rarely are there pictures of a tanker or cargo ship commander's or American Aviators or patrol boat commanders.  S will ome naval aviators are mentioned as are a few of the yachts and patrol boats thrown together by the Americans to begin the process of antisubmarine warfare. There are other places to get photos of American patrol and bomber aircraft this book could have been one of the few places to find pictures of the ad hoc results of arming small ships and boats against the ""U-boat menace"".It is only recently that historians have begun to focus on the daily life of average people during extraordinary times. When Ms. Wiggins turned her attentions to the history of Galveston and her people she produces some of her best work. We will get snapshots of bungled civil defense practice air raids, the intensity of the drive for scrap metals,  and of the steady increase in defensive measures funded by the Department of Defense. Given the importance of the Galveston shipyard and the oil tankers that would've been moving through the Houston ship Channel; Galveston could have become an important strategic target. Ms. Wiggins hints at the reality that this threat never materialized and therefore some of this investment seems a bit much.A fascinating story I had not heard before is presented in as the background of and the production miracle known as the ""Big Inch"". Started and finished in the last six months of 1942 this 1,475 mile long pipeline would help to deliver 300,000 barrels of oil per day from Texas to New York. All of this oil would be 100% safe from U-boat attacks. Incidentally 11 oil companies joined in the production of this pipeline with the understanding that the construction would be operated as a nonprofit corporation.Torpedoes in the Gulf: Galveston and the U-Boats, 1942-1943 is slightly better than history for a beach read. Her coverage of the U-boat war in the Gulf of Mexico is uneven. Her coverage of the local history in Galveston is an interesting slice of Americana worthy of preservation. She deserves credit for her efforts. I cannot recommend this book for the diehard World War II history buff seeking details on tactics, weapons, or decision-making. It is a short, interesting book about a rarely mentioned aspect of cultural life and the U Boat actions in the opening months of World War II.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OG4REMQ6AIIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0890966486#wasThisHelpful","R1OG4REMQ6AIIF","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned a much earlier version of the Kindle and had very much enjoyed the nice substantial cover I bought for it. That cover and that Kindle have lasted for several years.For my new Voyage, I splurged on this ""leather "" cover thinking I would get something upon which I could depend to give me years of protecting my Voyage.Nothing physically secures your voyage in this holder. There is a magnet. BUT-DONOT depend upon this device to secure your reader in case of a fall or any major shock. This is esp true if you have the cover open.When closed it may provide better protection but donot depend upon this protective cover.This ""leather"" Cover consists of single plate of plastic with a thin covering of what might be leather. This plate is attached by a flimsy piece of what may be leather to a felt covered piece of plastic that makes the origami back.To be fair the folding part is a clever design and performs as advertised.This thing feels flimsy, cheap and unreliable. It is leather the same way a block of sugar with a drop of vegetable juice is healthy.If you are undecided, be aware that every time you open the cover, your voyage will turn on. Some may find this a good thing. I think it is a waste of battery life. Turning off the Voyage is needlessly time wasting, and marginally more tricky with the cover on. Again this may or may not matter. The cover is not designed to allow you use the charger and have the device sitting up. Sitting sideways this is not an issue, but means you lose the choice for a more usual portrait mode reading experience. This looks to be a weakness in the design of the reader.Save your money. If you want this design, get the cheap version. That is one that is sold for less and creates lower expectations.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6GLN6B37HL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZVOOF4#wasThisHelpful","R2R6GLN6B37HL1","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure these items were given to me as a gift from someone with no association with Gracious Gourmet and no intent beyond introducing me to what they believed to be the finer things in package prepared food.My original intent had been to rate this as a not bad set of somewhat pricey chutney style food spreads. Thanks to some last-minute surprise experiences with the Apple Onion spread I am upgrading my opinion to very pleasant if still somewhat steep.The Cranberry Raspberry Blood Orange spread is a classic case of making a product too complex. As a fan of blood orange I would suggest that Cranberry Blood orange or Raspberry Blood orange would be a superior product. The three together were muddled and indistinguishable. It is reasonably tart and versatile but I found that the flavors ran together producing a balance of a sort but not a gourmet tasting experience.My original attitude towards the Apple Caramelized Onion was only slightly better. I've been introduced to the concept of apple and onion together in the stuffed pork chops my mother-in-law once made for us. I liked the result and still butterfly a thick pork chop just to slide in slices of apple and onion.  Cold from the jar as a garnish this was a cross between chutney and applesauce with nothing that made it special until... I was using the last of the Apple Onion combination on some potato pancakes. Even cold the combination produced a much better side dish than expected. By accident I also discovered that slightly warmed the combination spread yielded better, clear flavors. I wish I had just started this jar and would get to appreciate it more.Last observations on both jars was how pleasantly surprised I was to find that they had a much longer shelf life than I have found in other types of products. Given the lack of advanced chemistry in the ingredient list the shelf life greatly exceeded my expectation. The Gracious Gourmet people deserve credit for a short ingredients list that emphasizes natural foods with an effort to put fruits before things like sugars and salts. They are also to be credited for not loading their label or their other advertising with claims of their spreads as being health foods especially low sugar or otherwise appealing to too many trendy food gimmicks. The label does indicate naturally gluten-free and vegan status. This is a little silly given the fact that the ingredient list does not include any products likely to contain gluten or meat or eggs etc.Having come to appreciate especially the Apple onion spread I do intend to sample some other products from Gracious Gourmet but given the cost I will not be making this a regular item in my refrigerator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XBRX93F9IYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008POYNPQ#wasThisHelpful","R12XBRX93F9IYH","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line 1stThe Busy Bodie is an interesting period piece. It is somewhat unusual for being the work of a female. It is a light play; fairly easy reading but just not very funny. My review is of the Kindle edition; itself an electronic version of a publication of the Augustan Reprint Society.}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{{{To propose a theory of English Theater of the 18th Century; the use of large numbers of conventions may relate back to the same ideas in Punch and Judy. That is stock characters in stock situations help to orient the audience reduce the time needed to get the plot going and depend entirely on creative plot twists and clever dialogue. Susanna Centlivre's The Busy Body is according to the introduction drawn largely from three earlier plays. Centlivre starts with these plot devices and gives us mostly stock characters. Two young attractive resourceful women determined to get married. One pursued by her young lover and her elderly guardian. The other desirous of marriage with her young suitor but hanging under the threat of marriage on first sighting to an otherwise offstage Spaniard who will immediately lock her away from the world.So old man to be made fools of and twisting roads on the way to the altar; winding up with a delayed and overly contrived happy ending.Acting the fool to every other character is Marplot. He is the busybody of our title and will act as a witless disruptor any time secret plots appear to be progressing too smoothly. Of course there are inheritances, greedy money hoarding and an assumption that the way to protect a woman's virtue is to lock her away from the world.I was often reminded of the line in Star Wars spoken by the Princess ""the more you tighten your fist the more will slip through your fingers"". And indeed that is what this play will demonstrate.On top of the usual bits; hiding in cupboards;  wearing disguises, love letters and faked attempts to draw away susceptible, suspicious old men; we have an interesting plot twist involving two of the lovers. As the play opens Sir George Airy is in love with one woman he has never seen but has spoken with and another woman he has spoken with but never seen. This is the same woman: Miranda and while she seems very practical she never charges him with attempting to juggle two women. Somewhere this plot device is shuffled away never mined for its comic possibilities.There is some humorous patter.  The closest I came to laughing was  in the prologue where in the author addresses the audience and closes her poems saying ""Let your indulgence all her fears allay, and none but woman haters dam this play."" Amusing and a sample of some of the better wit in the text. The female point of view makes itself known largely in subtle ways. For example one of the future brides is will advised that her husband to be has all the qualities for which she may wish and all that is required is that both of them behave in a reasonable manner towards each other. It is the concept that husband and wife must behave the one rarely sees in other period comedies. That this comment is prefaced by noting that the state of matrimony is unfashionable is typical of these comedies.In the introduction it is noted that in adapting The Busy Bodie from earlier works some of the indelicacies have been toned down. There are casual references to cuckolding, women who work the streets and the habits of men who attend the brothel. One has to wonder how the old-time writers got their reputation for avoiding sexual references. Toned down indeed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MFM8LY3Q8ZQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00849DX62#wasThisHelpful","R2MFM8LY3Q8ZQ0","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line 1st- There is an autobiographical feel to the short novel The Cossacks. This is not uncommon with Tolstoy but is not the whole story. Tolstoy is a masterful storyteller. That quality is not manifest in this book. His translator does not serve him well. This is more accessible than his longer novels but may not leave the first time Tolstoy reader eager for the next book.The opening of Tolstoy's of the Cossacks is set in Moscow during a late-night carousal with dining drinking and light talk about affairs with women. The Traveler is a well to do, ne'er-do-well. He is leaving behind of broken hearts, debts and a certain cynicism about life. He will leave the tavern having kept it open after hours and not paying his share to begin a much anticipated trip away from civilization and into the Caucasus Mountains where he will find the Cossacks.The traveler is Olenin. He is a young member of the landed gentry. He has made the decision to join the Army and go south in an effort to learn about real life. In this way he is much like many a hero in a 19th century American novel who took the advice to "" Go West young man Go West"". Long before he arrives and takes up his life among people he believes to be simpler he has convinced himself that this is where he will find how to live an authentic life.Olenin has joined the Army as a cadet. That is he is not quite of an officer, not one of the soldiers and treated all the more special because he's rich. He will be free to live as he chooses and from the beginning we must understand that in this remote place his existence is one of being not quite this or that with a freedom to choose who he intends to be.He sets up his quarters in a crude Cossack village. Here Russians in general are barely tolerated but understood to be the masters. In this role they are not so much given respect as they are taking advantage of even as their orders are obeyed. In other words this relationship is complex and has a long history. The reason for a military outpost is that across the river lies the Chechens. Between the Chechens and the Cossacks is a very long standing enmity that expresses itself in official and unofficial cross-border expeditions, and in almost ritualistic exchanges of horse stealing, horse trading, firefights and revenging the dead of these firefights.We lose sight of our Russian as we are led through a successful defense against a Chechen raider who was shot dead by Lukashka. He is one of the more desirable of the village young men; something of a rogue and one of the natural local leaders. His plan is to get himself a horse so that the Russian army will promote him into the Calvary. From there he will have the additional standing needed to secure permission to marry the woman of his choice.Into this history and these various subplots Olenin will be seen wearing not the clothes of a rich Russian or even a military cadet but the ill-fitting clothing of a Cossack . Even as he makes the deliberate decision to ""go native"" he will let himself be guided by a mystical image of the honest simplicity of these people. He is determined not merely to live among them but to see them as participants in a romance that may only exist in his mind.The central conflict of this short novel revolves around the question of whether Olenin is capable of becoming one with the people of this Cossack village..There are elements of autobiography in The Cossacks. Tolstoy did serve in the Russian Army and his service was in the Caucasus. Later in life he would undergo a mystic transformation that would influence his philosophy. Given the years between these two events and between the writing of this story and his later life I do not accept this as simple autobiography. Tolstoy is playing with the problems of maturation and fitting in. The triangular relationships between the Russians the Cossacks in the Chechens are interesting history and may help shed some understanding on some of those same relationships in the 21st century. In the case of the Cossacks this background provides a setting and takes advantage of the author's experience.I found the storytelling to be too drawn out. A crisper narrative and a more direct pacing would've produced a tightly written poignant short story. A variety of words unlikely to have meaning to an English reader are left untranslated. Chechens are frequently referred to ""Abreks"". Not even context is sufficient to explain what this word means or why it is used. What a ""Nogay"" is, is never defined or explained. A great deal of ""Chikhit"" is consumed. A search on line will indicate that this could mean a locally produced wine , or a version of tea so strong as to have an intoxicating effect. The context leads me to believe this is the local wine. The translator should have made this clear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300E1ZTPD72OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00849YBZE#wasThisHelpful","R300E1ZTPD72OO","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The simplest way to express my opinion of Smart Aleck; is to tell you that I have added it to my wish list Howard Teichmann's biography of George S Kaufman. I have a standing  interest in the members of the Algonquin Round table and with this biography of Alexander Wollcott; I trust the author to do a good job with Kaufman. I am not too surprised to find that both books are out of print and only available from used bookstores.Among the high points of Smart Aleck are the aspects of his early life that to me seemed unlikely. His early life in semi-poverty was not nearly as surprising as his early life in a commune. That he was relatively un-athletic and picked on by his peers was no surprise. That he found a patron would help him attend Hamilton College was all but predictable. The author declares without reservation that Alexander Woollcott was a transvestite. More exactly he believes that he was a man of mostly indeterminate or at least minimal sexuality but with a preference for dressing up in women's clothing. That the men of Hamilton College would accept him as a drag queen seems to suggest a modern militancy about sexual identity that may not have existed over 100 years ago.It was known to me that as a drama critic Woollcott's opinion was the published voice that could make or break new Broadway New York productions. That he would have had to work his way up with in the reporter's trade is obvious in retrospect but had not occurred to me before. Given his personal extravagances, prickly ego, and famous skills at the groaning board I would never have thought of him as a soldier serving in the front in World War I. His original service was as a private soldier in an ambulance unit where he would've been exposed if not to shell fire then certainly the bloody realities of trench warfare. After his promotion to sergeant it would appear his many friends pulled some strings and got him assigned to a then brand-new publication Stars & Stripes. As a reporter on this soldier's newspaper he would take himself to the battlefront with the same clarity of clarity that he would take himself to the finest restaurants in Paris. It would be during his military service that Woollcott and his friend George Kaufman would begin the card games that would later morph into the Algonquin Round Table.It is likely that many important drama critics of his generation would've had a hand in promoting many of the careers that would become associated with Woollcott. He would claim the Marx Brothers as special protgs and Harpo Marx would become a lifelong friend. Woollcott was almost the sole critic to  promote the play that would introduce Spencer Tracy. And while this list could go on for many more lines; Teichmann devotes little more than a paragraph to efforts by Woollcott to advance the career of a young black singer Paul Robeson.For the rest, Woollcott was a large man and lived a large life. He would succeed in several media. Listing his many friends often read like name-dropping. This becomes a problem when Teichmann frequently assumes that you know the careers that go with the names.The weakness to this book is its preference for the sharper retorts and cutting witticisms.  The Round Table was famous for saber slash insults made by brilliant writers. It is fun to store up famous Woollcott jabs, but only towards the end to we get significant samples of his writing. The subtitle of Smart Alack is: The Wit, World and Life of Alexander Woollcott. All of these things are delivered. What is missing from the title, and more critically missing in the text  are Woollcott's words.It would have been interesting to have a few extended selections from the Woollcott keyboard. Especially those that demonstrated the various qualities Teichmann ascribes to Woollcott. It would have been interesting to contrast his early reports from the seamy side of New York City with his sometimes gushing reviews of performances by favored actors. A partial radio script would help to demonstrate the more mature writer, but also the differences he knew to be necessary in writing for the theater page and speaking to a live audience.This is not an academic biography; this is a good thing for us non-academic readers.  I also credit Teichmann with working to attempt neutrality about his subject. The result is readable, if overly larded with needless references to the man's weight and Buddha Belly. It is also too much of a name dropper book. These are petty complaints, but near dearth of original Woollcott material makes Smart Alack less than it could have been.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPP3W3PIPJOH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0688030343#wasThisHelpful","RPP3W3PIPJOH3","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line: a good enough charger and a very good value.I have come to despise chargers, esp cell phone chargers.Always overpriced; each one more flimsy than the last. The assumption seems to be that no one is going to keep the phone for any amount of time, and everyone needs chargers so gouge them on price and make them fail fast.The fact that flimsy materials, and folding prongs combine to be possible fire hazards seem to matter to no one.Which is why I prefer this Travel Home Charger.Mine cell is my wife's cast off phone. I hope it to be my phone for a long time to come. The charger that came with it was one of those folding prong types. I have had problems with it and I distrust it.I like that this one has fixed prongs and so far it does its job reliably.The feel of it does not inspire confidence. It feels flimsy. It feels like it could use some heat resistance or better technology. All kinda vague.  After an overnight recharge it was warm , but not hot, something I take as a warning for the future.As for the red light, it comes on before the phone is attached and stays on after the phone is removed.

"There are the makings of several good history books in the Nicholas Rankin' s Ian Fleming's Commandos. And for all the meticulous research none of those possible history books are completed.We do eventually get some information about the World War II history of 30 Assault Unit, a.k.a 30 Commando. We do get occasional sightings of Reserve Navy Commander Ian Fleming but up until the end of the book there are very few complete and completely connected narratives. We get something of the usual story of Bletchley Park and decoding the German Enigma machine. There is a little of Alan Turing. This is nice except neither Fleming nor his commandos were ""read into"" the secrets of Alan Turing and his code breaking. This is according to the footnotes in the book. There are bits about commando training the formation of what would become the Special Boat Service and a few asides about America's OSS  and its Chief Wild Bill Donovan. But at least in these cases there is some evidence that these people had occasional contact with 30 Commando or Fleming.To his credit Rankin mentions several specific achievements by German Intelligence, code breaking and tactical targeted intelligence gathering. This is one of the few books I have read that speaks to these kinds of successes. The text will make the point that Fleming got the idea to form small group commando units for the purpose of targeting and seizing, called pinching, important enemy documents and devices from active battlefields. The more technical term for this approach is given in the preface as TARget EXploitation, TAREX. The term will not be used again.The units within 30 Commando would eventually consist of a few technically trained individuals supported by commando trained Royal Marines. Their job was to go if possible, in front of attacking forces in an effort to overrun radar stations and command bunkers with the intention of collecting papers, codes and secret equipment before they are destroyed in the course of the fighting, as defensive measures by the retreating Germans or the usual souvenir hunting and casual destruction by the indifferent attacking allies.In general I like Rankin's writing style and there are several good individual stories within the larger text. The problem is there's just too many scattered, short, and poorly connected bits of history cobbled together to make his book. Better editing and a tighter focus and Ian Fleming's Commandos would be another good book about a relatively obscure operation within World War II.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOR0T0N799MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199782822#wasThisHelpful","R2AOR0T0N799MS","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not only do I count myself a Fran Leibowitz fan but I bought this movie hungry for her particular brand of acerbic insightful wit. There are certainly some sharp bon mot layered in to some depth between short bits about her friends, her life in New York, but ultimately I felt the woman had been softened and polished more than was necessary. For a friend Leibowitz fan this is an opportunity to meet the woman in a more conversational mode. The aspects of Fran the deliberate sharp minded wit and her explanations of her life and influences are balanced but I don't feel I know Miss Leibowitz that much better or have had the chance to enjoy the best of her mind.The advantage of reading the work of Miss Leibowitz either as collected in her more famous books or in her occasional essays with Vanity Fair is that you meet her focused on a topic and exhausting what she has to say about that topic. In the movie you get a variety of high points, bits of narrative and some very interesting video moments of some of the people who help illustrate points she is making. It is not immediately clear, for example why James Baldwin in debate with Bill Buckley Junior is part of this movie but it does not take much to align their brilliantly worded debate points with the kind of New York experience Miss Leibowitz is describing. There are several efforts to distinguish wit defined as being sharp edge and judge mental as opposed to humor which is defined as friendly. While this point is fairly well made the discussion relating jazz rhythms and successful joke telling is abandoned as an incomplete thought.Fran Leibowitz fans are logical audience for this documentary. Speaking as one I conclude that it is almost all that I would want from this kind of documentary. For a person using this documentary as an introduction to Miss Leibowitz there is some good background but I'm not sure this conversation works as an introduction. It is a very friendly documentary and Scorsese is adept at varying the visuals to maintain interest I wish he had been so free with the editing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7B5856QMVI8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR0SF8G#wasThisHelpful","R7B5856QMVI8T","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first bought this collection back in 2013. It has taken me so long to get into the 3rd bottle that it is past expiration. On the other hand, it has taken me this long to get to the third bottle (French Garden BTW) because there was nothing in the first two that made it important for me to use the other two.Too many of the bottled dressings include sugar (?!) or some other less desirable sweetener, and way too much salt. Compared to the more popular store bought envelopes of salad powder, the variety pack is infinitely better. The envelope stuff is sugar, salt and chemicals. Maybe it is because I have so many local choices for spices and I grow myown basil that I find myself under whelmed with the Homemade Dressing Mix Variety Pack.I found very little to choose between the first two bottles (Italian and California) and I give the third an almost by, in that I suspect that even freshly opened it was no better than the other two. All made reasonable salad dressings but I found myself adding to all of them. At minimum a raw garlic clove, sometimes a Bay leaf went into the bottle; when I had some Romano or Parma or some other grated cheese and so forth. On a plus side, using a good quality balsamic always added depth and complexity to the finished dressing.We are not that fond of dry rubs, so I never used any in this form. I have a fairly wide selection of spices for sprinkling on foods, salads and never felt that these added better flavor than my other choices.My bottom line: Homemade Dressing Mix Variety Pack: a huge improvement over most bottled and envelope type salad dressing but not much of an improvement over what I can make using the spices I already carry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ53X1SLBEH63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019F30J8#wasThisHelpful","RQ53X1SLBEH63","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In one assembly, you add your fresh coffee grounds or fresh lose tea leaves into a small mesh cup that hides up in the lid. Into the double walled plastic BPA free container you pour your hot water. There is a lever arm that pivots the cup down into the water and allows the steeping to begin. At desired strength, you move the lever and the cup is drawn back into the lid and above the level of the water. The lid does double duty as your drinking on the go drinking cup, lid.The assembly is designed to facilitate cleaning, but it can be tricky to completely empty the mesh cup and to completely clean the entire assembly. I have used the dish washer to no ill effect.What is odd is that I am better at making tea than coffee, and so far I much prefer this device for my office cuppa joe. There is no device related reason, but so far I am not getting the best tea out of this Perfect Tea Infuser.  I think one part is that the small infuser cup only allows in about one table spoon of fresh grounds. This is a tad too much for tea, and allowing for reduced measures of tea, it is possible that in comparison, the retained coffee grounds do not continue to drip flavor into the coffee to the same degree as the drippings from the same infuser with tea.Good:The lid is a threaded, screw attachment to the cup -This is a Huge item for me as I have had to abandon 6-8 snap on lid type cups. The snap on lids can lose their snap and they can become leaky. The screw fitting is more reliable, should last longer and is less like to come off when the cup is older.Easy and intuitive to useYou control your resultsYou can use any fresh grounds/tea leaves you wantYou can ignore the mesh cup and use tea bags, or cold beveragesKeeps the beverage hot enough, long enough for me. Your experience may varyCould be better:The snap cover over the drinking spout can be hard to open, often taking both hands. (while driving?)Once open the snap cover does not secure in any way. It will flop about and can leave your restraining forefinger wet.The lid on the mesh cup is held shut by a simple friction latch. This latch will fail over time.Forget that your coffee/tea is still brewing, you can get some very strong drink.Minor note:The Amazon offering was cheaper than the major mall chain stores where I got my first one. That vendor had only one color choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RA3FQA5HJ83X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q3L9PA#wasThisHelpful","R2RA3FQA5HJ83X","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second of this item. That should tell you I like it. The first lasted several years, outlasting several batteries.I tend to bike in traffic almost daily and in the fog or grey of dawn/dusk this little light helps.I have never taken it off road, but it holds up well in the rain and weather. It is easy to attach to the bars under your seat. This version has solid red, blinking and fast blinking settings.When it is time to change the battery, the halves of the shell can be work to separate. If you do not have some strength in your hands or fingers, I recommend using a blade or some such to lever them apart. It is water tight, so this is a fair trade off.My order took much longer than I had originally expected and tracking info was not much help. Depending on how fast you need this light or how remote you are from other choices, you may wish to consider another version or vendor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0AE1EMOMVK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRZNM12#wasThisHelpful","R1O0AE1EMOMVK1","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the movie across the universe Joe Cocker sings and performs Come Together. Thanks to Julie Taymor that sequence constitutes a beautiful piece of storytelling. Within about three seconds Joe Cocker takes this Beatles song and makes it forever his.I go years at a time unaware of who the rock stars are at any given moment. But beginning with this performance I began to focus some attention on Joe Cocker and look for examples of his online performances. In doing so I found myself listening to an absolute master of what I grew up to know as rhythm and blues, classic pop and good balladeer. The two disc set Joe Cocker Gold sums up everything I need to know about Joe Cocker the musician.It seems like any time Joe sang from the Beatles songbook it is his version I continue to hear. Little Help from My Friends , She Came in through the Bathroom Window, Something and not in this set, the aforesaid Come Together in my mind will always be the Joe Cocker version. I don't know if anyone else has ever sung The Letter, but in the version on this in this set, recorded live carries an energy and joy difficult to reduce to words. The version on this disc made me realize the expression ""backup band"" is not right. To refer to musical team, vocal and instrumental present on this stage and the engineering team that place it on your player as a backup band is rather like referring to the Philharmonic supporting an opera star soloist as a backup. The energy high carries over into the next cut recorded live at the same concert as Joe sings: Cry Me a River. We are used to hearing this as a tearful, soulful, torch song. Here the message is totally different. Joe Cocker and company sing this song as is a victory celebration;"" I am free of you, moved on and you can suffer that's your problem.""I'm not going to claim that Joe Cocker's version of Unchain My Heart forever displaces Ray Charles but the two can stand beside each other as honorable competitors.I enjoyed most of the 36 cuts in this set. I most admire Joe Cocker is a rhythm and blues singer and as  a pop singer, his  ballads don't tend to move me the same. Approximately the last third of the two record set seems to be less soulful and occasionally more political. This is a legitimate decision in terms of giving the listener a complete sample of the range of this man. Several of these cuts are not as appealing to me.My bottom line is that Joe Cocker Gold is a brilliant and moving cross-section of the work of a man who left behind some very beautiful, get you dancing in your ear pods, and very soulful sounds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSIEI8AKZFWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0OERG#wasThisHelpful","R2NSIEI8AKZFWN","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a reason why the top award for American comic books is the Will Eisner Award.  He was that good. His Spirit and Lady Luck comics (He would call his craft sequential art) were among the early efforts to target an adult audience and were famous for their sophistication and artistry. Eisner was also famous applying cartoon techniques to US Army maintenance manuals.With the publication of A Contract With God, book one of this trilogy Eisner created the Graphic Novel. In this volume are all three books of the Dropsie Avenue Trilogy. Properly the Contract with God Trilogy, but it is easier to specify the first book from this volume by referring to the trilogy under Dropsie Ave.Book one focuses on one pious Jewish emigrant Frimme Hersh, who has just lost his daughter. This he considers an act of God that violates the contract he thought he had with God. It is Jewish tradition that the act of Circumcision is conducted as part of sealing an ongoing contract with God, But Eisner needs this contract to be more literal.The young Frimme had just barely survived a Russian Pogrom aimed at killing the Jews in his area. The other surviving Jews chose him as one of the few they could afford to get to America. The young boy needing to know asks: Is God is Just? By this he means, if I do good things will God see to it that good things happen to me.  On receiving assurances that God is Just and will reward good for good, the boy writes and lives by this contract. It is the problem of bad things happening to good people that will drive much of this first book.Each book will concern itself with large questions while refusing to create worlds that are absent good and evil each meted out in almost arbitrary ways. Good employers are beset by Union thugs. Bullies exist behind almost every cause and government can be corrupt and a method of doing good. In this way the almost indestructible slum tenant house on Dropsie Avenue because the stage where on humans will strut out their days and try to find meaning.In addition the last book will be an extended history of the 200 years of the Dropsie neighborhood. As the population changes from Dutch , to English to Irish to Italian to Jewish  to Puerto Rican, each new group must earn trust and respect and in turn try to deal with the slow collapse of what was comfortable as the next group arrives. When does a neighborhood or a civilization begin to decline? What can humans do to counter this collapse?The Dropsie Ave Trilogy is beautiful. The artistry is consistently detailed. Emotions, physical conditions and class are very easy to identify. The power of the visual to impart meaning is a part of what made Wisner the inspiration his namesake award implies. Each story has its O'Henry surprise, but many of these have the feel of the old comic book tradition from Tales of The Crypt and other of the more melodramatic monsters and gore comics  Where people get their comeuppances, there is a overly dramatic, written for the comics feel. This may be the standard comic book convention, but it can become too predictable. Occasionally story lines will disappear or get lost in transitions. Eisner generally has more than one plot line going but on occasion he has problems keeping all of them moving smoothly.Visually this is a great book. The narrative can be over wrought. Note the phrase `can be'. The more subtle plot lines had me wishing that more of his stories could play-out in quieter tones.Being a graphic novel does not mean comic book. Eisner's designed his trilogy for adults. There is language, violence and sex. Note that violence does not mean gore and the sex includes bared females but not graphic intimate depictions. This is pretty much a history of white, New York City immigrant life in the early 20th century. Many of the main characters are Jewish. I did not find that any people were stereotyped.  Generally people were either good or bad and sometimes alternating. This would be a product of their personalities, not racial or ethnic background. All of this may be important to your decision making.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EPOAPQVHOHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393061051#wasThisHelpful","R3EPOAPQVHOHE","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the unabridged CD version read by Robert Glenister.One the small chance you do not know this already: Robert Galbraith is on of Ms. J K Rowling better known for the Harry Potter books, movies et al.  In the Cuckoos Calling she takes on the Hard Boiled Detective in what will be a series of books around her version of the continental op: Cormoran Strike. The second book is due out in the summer; I already have it on my wish list. In other words I enjoyed this  book.The conventions for the hardboiled detective are here with just slight twists. Private eye Cormoran Strike is in ruinous finical condition, his personal life is a wreck and his past includes a promising career as an Army Criminal Investigator ended by an Afghan road side bomb that took part of his leg. He is too independent to take advantage of programs that might help his medical, mental or financial pains and there are other complexities that separate him from family.One nice twist is the arrival of Robin, a hugely over qualified temp secretary with a secret yen to be a detective and the brains earn the trust and respect of her impecunious boss.Coincident with her arrival is a well off client with a nice check and the suspicious suicide of his half-sister. The game is afoot.The deceased was a super model. This means that the suspects are all well connected high end leaders in the fashion and related high roller industries. From snobby Lawyers and their cynical wives, to the fey clothing designers, Strike will bring us to many trendy and expensive places.What I like best about the writing is that Galbraith is scrupulously fair with the reader. We know everything at the same time Strike does. The mystery is highly solvable and there are regular reminders of what we should be looking at. One thing I realized about a ""who done it"" is it is not enough to pick out the villain. You must have the narrative correct and spot the necessary proof. Gone are the guilty who has to blurt out a confession saving the author the problem of court allowable evidence.  I worked out why the crime took place and almost had the right suspect.... More on this is a spoiler or maybe just face saving.There was too much description. Galbraith (Rowling) is too enamored of back story. Too many people have to tell you too much about too many things not because they move the story forward but because the author is fascinated by backstory. Several of the description give away that the writer is female. I have never heard a man, including a gay man refer to a woman's beauty as ""Insipid"" . The phrase sticks out in part because I cannot tell you what insipid beauty in a woman's picture means.On long drives I like having a book in the CD player. Robert Glenister did an extremely good job. He gave each character their voice and never crossed his characters. The story takes place in London so he needed a number of British accents and he needed them to be easy for a non-English audience to understand. Thank you, Mr. Glenister for a job well done.My bottom line: The Cuckoos Calling is a ""rattling good yarn. The language can be very salty, but sex and violence are strictly behind closed doors. Strike may be his name, but he gains what he needs from his interviews without threats or any version of enhanced interrogation. I look forward to more private side crime solving by Cormoran Strike and Robin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4G7KLT1PIEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478983671#wasThisHelpful","R3O4G7KLT1PIEE","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The back cover blurb on my paperback copy of Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis makes the following two statements:"" Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the 20th century..."" and ""remarkable for its relentless skewering of artifice and pretension, Lucky Jim also contains some of the finest comic set pieces in the language."" I'm I cannot agree.This is supposed to be a satire of British collegiate life in the late 50s. Notice that we never see a class in session we only meet one student and he appears to be avid about his studies. We are never part of a faculty meeting, or anything that would indicate that there is either education or educational administration is in process. We are given to follow Lucky Jim, Jim Dixon a brand-new lecturer at an unnamed and clearly undistinguished University. He is Unhappy with and incompetent at his job but willing to do a great deal of kissing up to retain it.Jim will do almost anything to avoid doing his job and does not care if he is not doing it well. He does care to jump through the right hoops that would make his department head decide to keep them. This is one reason why much of the book takes place at his supervisor's home. His department head is apparently a superannuated professor with a number of personal failings. We don't know anything about his skills as an instructor and we can only second-guess what his skills are as a department head.Jim is basically an analytical person who attempts to calculate a wide variety of his life's decisions only to find that his calculations are usually irrelevant. He is full of bluff, bully and bluster and yet he is capable of loyalty, feelings and a certain physical bravery. He can be extravagantly and wantonly destructive and his internal dialogue emphasizes his caustic attitude towards almost everyone around him. The validity of his judgment is never made an objective fact.So what we have is a famous satire of university life that , speaks to the steps a new instructor might take to pad out his performance review and protect his job. Very little else is explored and very little of this is funny.A major sub plot that functions independent of any comments about college life is Dixon's love life. He finds himself involved with a fellow instructor Margaret who is recovering from an attempted suicide. Hardly the stuff of jokes. He will meet and find himself attracted to a woman by the name of Christine. Christine is already involved with an artist, the son of his supervisor and according to Jim a terrible artist in a terrible person- based only on Jim's spontaneous say so. Christine would seem more of a kindred spirit willing to help him in some of Jim's devilment and she is more physically attractive. The reader is presented with an almost cliche situation: the unattractive more mature original girlfriend or the more physically attractive younger and perhaps equally immature potential girlfriend. Amos deserves credit for taking a clich situation and resolving it in an unexpected way.Lucky Jim is a well told story. We have every reason in the first future pages dislike Jim Dixon and yet he is a character with whom one may identify.  Kingsley Amis writes well enough that I came to care about how his plot proceeds. You may or may not care about where this book takes lucky Jim.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTL88DOIYDXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590175751#wasThisHelpful","R3RTL88DOIYDXX","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Major themes get introduced and dropped.A woman gets a chance of a life time to live a very well to do life in an exotic setting complete with a live in maid and a very wise and supportive circle of friends.  As she drinks, smokes parties and whines and complains about mostly herself, we are supposed to feel what?Whatever the difference is between self-depreciating humor and self-loathing pathology this FL pounds on past that limit - the one pleasure of her life is running - only her book has you dragging behind gasping for some sign of relief.Run away.

"I had read all of the Hornblower books at least twice before I found out that there had been a movie made back in 1951. Fortunately the O'Brian, Aubrey/Maturin would not come to me until later. For me C. S. Forester was the man for tales of the warfare under sail and following Hornblower from Midshipman to the hoisting of his Admiral's flag was as much adventure as this reader needed prior to myown days as a Midshipman. I came to this movie as a fan of the written word.The movie, Captain Horaito Hornblower combines plot lines from several of the books and begins with our hero as captain ( not just a Master and Commander, you can tell because he has epilates on both shoulders) , of a His Majesty's Frigate Lydia. Lydia is rated 36 gun frigate making her a slightly heavier ship than had been typical of the British Navy. By comparison, fictional British frigate Master and Commander `Lucky"" Jack Aubry had as his favorite ship the HMS Surprise rated at 22 guns. About this same general time America's most famous Frigate was the USF Constitution, aka `Old Ironsides, rated at 44 guns. These kinds of details mattered to me as an early fan and continue to be more interesting to me than who scored what in the Super Bowl.In the first part of the movie, Lydia has been dispatched to the Pacific Ocean on a mission that will have her capture a Spanish 50 gun, 3 decker Ship of the Line, the Natividad. Taking a larger sized ship via sneak attack is hardly a daring do for our hero, so he will take her again in ship to ship battle upon the open seas. Had he both defeated and captured this ship our Captain and his crew would have been insured a secure financial security in the way of prize money, but Hornblower was never that lucky in matter of money, the Natividad sinks.He does leave the far side of the world with a slightly different prize. Virginia Mayo in the role of Lady Barbara Wellesley, a close relative of Lord Wellington, and betrothed to Horatio's future commanding officer. None of this should matter, because Hornblower had come into this mission a married man. The combination of his heroics and skill as her ladyship's nurse (tropical fevers being what they are) means that the voyage will end with these two more than best friends forever. This is a 1951 movie, so it is up to you to decide just what friends with benefits entail on a shipboard romance.Upon return to England, Captain Hornblower is placed in command of a captured Franch 74, the Southerland.  Back to a touch of techie speak. The Sutherland was a razee, that is a French three decker razeed, cut back to a two decker. These were much admired, very maneuverable, heavily gunned warships, and by the way had lines that made her easy to confuse with a French ship.And so the viewer has several plot lines, military and romantic that will need to be resolved if our hero is to complete a mission more exciting that beating a single larger combatant and returning to fatherhood but not to the arms of his wife, or the bed of his commanding officer's wife.All of the above contribute to a very watchable movie. Gregory Peck is perhaps too American for such a British role, but the target audience was American. Not only does Peck provide a very believable very British naval officer, he also made real the famous Hornblower ""Hhaarrumph"" the fictional character would use to cover confusion and esp when the confusion was caused by a lady.  Virginia Mayo was all that any movie heroine of the day could be. Whether she is suffering from fevers or posing in Empire waited high fashion, Ms. Mayo keeps the romance in this seafaring romance.Captain Horatio Hornblower is a full on classic, popcorn and family movie. Perhaps too much of a guy film for date night, but nothing in the way of bad language or overt sex to keep parents and the young `uns apart. The violence is mostly the off screen and cartoonish. Nowhere is the nightmarish truth of wooden ship warfare. I do not think this movie compares well with the much later Master and Commander, no do I think the Hornblower books stand as well against the Jack Aubry books. I am certain that a these two heroes would have enjoyed each other's company.  Likewise if the one fits your film library the other will make good company.Of the added features, the Friz Freleng, Mell Blanc Merrie Melody cartoon, Captain Hareblower is far more fun then the overly simplified overly dramatic middle school summary of American History: My Country Tis of Thee. It  is awkward at best and ill matched to an action movie build around a very British version of wooden ships and Iron men.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381T4D3PVCPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KJU18C#wasThisHelpful","R381T4D3PVCPL","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Between 1997 and 2005 the British movie making people produced four movies all based on fact and just naughty enough. In each the moral seem to be that a certain amount of naughty is nice if it is sufficiently noble.First, out of work and out of shape men turned strippers in: The Full Monty in order to pay their bills. This movie made enough money to help green light what followed. What followed was a movie about ladies of a certain age posing in the altogether to raise charity money with the calendar hence the name Calendar Girls. Back to the man we had a shoe factory owner shifting to high-fashion boots specifically for male cross-dressing performers needing to wear ""18 inches of sex appeal"" in Kinky Boots. With Mrs. Henderson Presents we have a very rich newly widowed woman bringing female nudity to Britain's West End for what we will find are her own noble reasons.Backed with a regular display of very lovely if static nude females and some nicely performed 1940s music; Mrs. Henderson Presents is basically a two person movie with Dame Judy Dench a sprightly and twinkle eyed lady of more than a certain age and a no longer young but very well match performance by Bob Hoskins as her theatrical producer Mr. Vivian Van Damm. Pop singer and songwriter Will Young Is the sometimes stiff but game lead singer for Ms. Henderson's vaudeville like stage troop. Actress Kelly Reilly plays Maureen the lithe young blonde who will give a personal identity to the mostly nameless other ladies of the show.Most of the dialogue given to Dame Judy Dench is wry and amusing. As always she is the master of presenting her lines with just the right accent and just the right twinkle. In a number of scenes she and Mr. Hoskins are supposed to be arguing with some ferocity. Ferocity is not appropriate to the otherwise lighter and amused attitude of this movie and so none of these disagreements are very convincing. Director Stephen Frears never allows emotions to get high. This is a light entertainment and there really is no need for any great depth in the emotions.Everything about Mrs. Henderson presents speaks of light entertainment and just enough history and purposefulness that this can be a date night or a family movie. There is nudity aplenty but appropriate to the story and never presented as titillation (yes it's a pun but it had to be said). If this combination works for your family this is a pleasant and relaxing movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7G0ZL5AX2A0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETRCN0#wasThisHelpful","R7G0ZL5AX2A0O","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is possible that I had first come to enjoy the works of James Thurber from before I could read. We had several of his books including the 1945 addition of The Thurber Carnival. In the course of flipping through them I would've found and certainly enjoyed his childlike drawing style long before I came to appreciate itssometimes subtle and sophisticated humor. Some years later I would've read the several Thurber books we had and then for some reason not return to him for decades.What I remember most from that first reading was how many of the stories I found quite funny. What struck me most forcibly in this newer edition is how many stories were not intended as humor. Early in his career James Thurber was taken on as a writer for then brand-new magazine the New Yorker the joke was that he came in as an editor and worked his way down to be a writer. How much the character and personality of the New Yorker in 2015 is a continuation of traditions that James Thurber and his editor and friend Harold Ross ( for whom the book is dictated) built in the 1930s is a subject more appropriate for English major dissertations. If these pieces are foundational they speak of an editorial policy that had for clever New York sophisticates and simpler Ohio country people.The Thurber Carnival is divided up into several pieces a few not before published in book form but most drawn from earlier collections. Of course we have The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and one of my own favorites The Unicorn in the Garden. Although possibly the single funniest piece is his one-page rewrite of Little Red Riding Hood.What I had forgotten for my original read those several decades ago was how many of these pieces are not intended to be humor. When speaking of the family bulldog there is a certain respect bordering on reverence some of the other pieces are more profiles but not quite caricatures. This speaks to Thurber's ability to hone his language. There is care and precision in Thurber's use of the language such that he can sneer or lightly satirize with very small shifts in word choice. He certainly can be heavy-handed and there are pieces where one suspects his various medical histories and swiftly failing eyesight were more in command of what is on the page than what a less physically frustrating life would've produced. James Thurber seem to be one of those who is best able to praise every era except his own. In this respect it is interesting to see a man of almost 100 years ago complaining about the eminence of the collapse of civilization in many of the same terms one can find in 2015 or an 1815.Much of the last 50 or so pages of this book highlight Thurber the cartoonist modern critic might speak to his economy of line in his impressionistic representation of intent rather than literal photographic reproduction of figures and animals. This would suggest that he was capable of photographic reproduction. Likely he had no interest in attempting photo-realism. He drawings only appear to be crude. A few curves create a period style woman's cloth hat, or a dogs worried expression. In one cartoon a disheveled woman, carrying a pistol has barged into a couples flat to ask if  `You folks have any .38 cartridges?How well his pre-World war II humor translates into the 21st century may be a matter of taste. Little of what he says about marriage should be taken literally but it rarely assumes the woman's point of view. Alternately he seems to have little use for weak overly accommodating women. In his cartoon story, the War between Men and Women, he has the men winning, but his women are not bowed by defeat. Thurber women smash the ball in Croquet, or throw it when bowling.The Thurber Carnival does not strike me as consistently clever as an equal quantity of Mark Twain, or as slick as early Woody Allen College Comedy. I rarely found myself laughing. There much in The Thurber Carnival that should have you smiling and the rest will help you to see into a period of time before now, but not that far removed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LVY9U9BG6DFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060932872#wasThisHelpful","R1LVY9U9BG6DFL","A3HJAIFRRFHUAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HJAIFRRFHUAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Philips really knows how to make excellent tooth brushes, I used to have the Flexcare one from them but it was over $200 bucks at that time and after going through two ( over a few years) I was excited to try this model and it's truly wonderful. Fancy settings, pulsating massages and all that jazz is nice with Flexcare but at this price you still get an incredible gentle yet through cleaning with the 2 model. After using this I often spend hours running my tongue across my teeth, glass smooth and no bleeding gums, something to really smile about.Excellent product, I love using this with sensitive tooth paste, it makes hot and cold food tooth pain a thing of the past.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWPPKORGHGZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZHP49K#wasThisHelpful","RJWPPKORGHGZV","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, these sheets are wonderful, silky and fluid they feel very relaxing and soft. Everyone needs sheets and these are really nice, when I have extra cash I like to get highest quality top notch Hotel sheets but at hundred bucks on sale per item, flat sheet, fitted sheet, they are a challenge so these were a great surprise and you can get more than one set to change up, I all ready used them twice in a row, sleep and wash style because they are very luxurious and nothing beats that clean feeling fresh soft sheet! They seem to lool me to sleep like nothing else.I love the color and the weave, they look so silky and fresh on the bed and I loved waking up in them, they stay cool through the night and wash well, I'm a huge fan. It seems like sheets are something of a second thought for people but we do spend a third of our lives sleeping, that's a fact for those lucky ones who get tons of shut eye, so might as well spend it in comfort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GN6E75TP5T2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9VP7ZA#wasThisHelpful","R1GN6E75TP5T2N","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful item for any cat and their owner. I have three fur babies myself and my middle one, midnight black Emily ( Mimi) loves this so much that she sleeps on it at night. I have this in our bedroom on the side by the wall and when she's not scratching away and pawing at the mice we hide in the holes she loves to lounge on this, few days ago she slept so hard she almost rolled over but she's a big cat so it happens with her.This is sturdy but lightweight enough to move through the house with ease, all my cats were very interested when I opened the box, one even stayed in the shipping box all night haha, they are so silly. I love the design, it's a modern take on the paper scratcher which can be a bit bulky, I might need to get more, one for each room.

"Just like Feline Pine, my picky cat who recently was only used to use the expensive crystal litter is actually planting his hairy behind in here which is great ( when he's pissed he will go on my bed as a reminder of who really runs this house) so I'm happy. I use plastic shopping bags to grab out the #2s and scooper for pee.... it's absorbent and so far doesn't smell too bad. I might start getting this more often as it works and as long as my cats are using it I'm happy, it's really in their paws.This being recycled is also important, it looks like my pellet chinchilla food haha, and better for environment so I will try to get this more often, it's good stuff that takes a little time to get used to but it controls odor and absorbs any wetness really fast. I like how natural this looks and smells, it's not a box of chemicals that carries out and which my pets will lick off their feet later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8K970TZ46YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYI0LGI#wasThisHelpful","RX8K970TZ46YY","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cardamom, black leather, basil and cedarwood? Yes please! I gave this to my boyfriend but even I steal it sometimes in the shower, this stuff smells intense, very very fresh and aggressively refreshing. Be prepared to smell crisp and powerfully clean all day.Burberry makes some of the best fragrances in the world, I've worn some through the years and this body wash is truly an experience.

"One of my favorite shampoos for the morning, it really wakes you and your hair up, it's bright and green with a high shine gloss and it suds up wonderfully, it really wakes me up in the morning. I love this when I want extra freshness and will pair it with the Shea conditioner which guarantees smoothness. You can feel the nourishing ingredients care for your hair as you wash it in, the olive is hidden but working, I love this stuff, so green and vibrant you wish you could sink your teeth in it, but please don't lol.It's a glossing formula and I actually do notice a lot of shine from this, a gloss finish that is very vibrant and silky. My hair feels very clean, went and fresh and when I run out of the house in the morning and it feels bouncy and invigorated. Best basic daily shampoo that I can think of that's anything but ""basic""... it's the elevated daily wash. It's simple but does a lot for your tresses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4A97YGDIDINF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRDPRQ2#wasThisHelpful","R4A97YGDIDINF","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of the Fekkai products, three of their shampoos have been a staple in my shower this summer and I'm really enjoying this color care shampoo because it's go gentle! I don't color my hair every month on the dot anymore, I used to but I get busy and forget ... but this is so delicate, and smells like cherries on ice with cream ( actually lovely, I promise) and the suds are super gentle, it's a creamy pink pearl formula that feels decadent and I love to use this at night if I was cleaning the house and sweating - specially in the hot summer, it makes the hair baby soft and it doesn't feel like it strips it off anything but topical oil and gunk.I will have to get the conditioner because I'm curious if it's as gentle and nourishing as the shampoo but really, thumbs up, if you wash your hair and even if you don't color it, this is so delicate and caring it will make your hair happy no matter what. Great for people who wash it a lot, some days I wash my hair twice; when its hot and since my hair is long, I like to wash it before bed as well which is something I have never done before using Fekkai, and using this at night is no problem, really gentle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMDU0GZL1I1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRDPP6O#wasThisHelpful","R1IMDU0GZL1I1V","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a must for anyone with hair that has length to it due to damage that eventually happens, even the best shampoo and conditioner can benefit from a finishing creme like this one, I apply it after I wash and towel try my hair ( gently) just a finger dab into the jar, then rub between hands and scruch into hair, then brush and wait for it to settle into a soft, frizz free style.This stuff is wonderful, I was surprised how large this jar is, it will last me forever and the scent is great; tropical flowers, scent of Jasmine blooming in moonlight, just delicious. I love cremes like this one, Ojon makes my other favorite one, and fear not, Fekkai's is not greasy, I don't recommend going overboard and applying too much, start small and see how much you need, but this makes any hair really soft and smooth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNNNMMSSZ9G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYZY6SY#wasThisHelpful","RMNNNMMSSZ9G6","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suggest using this with the Shea Shampoo for the ultimate luxury experience, this conditioner is serious! It's thick and creamy, it coats the hair in cream and Shea and the most amazing Jasmine scent, it's everything you want in a conditioner. I don't even have to leave in more than a minute of two to see results, it untangles the hair and makes it very smooth and fresh, most heavy duty conditioners weight it down but never with this stuff, I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLHUGJTGE4Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRDPSE8#wasThisHelpful","R1FLHUGJTGE4Q8","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using a variety of Fekkai shampoo, conditioner and grooming products for a month now and my hair really does feels different, it's smoother after I wash it with a silky freshness to it and this Shea line smells really creamy and decadent. If you are a big jasmine lover then this is the item for you. Scent wise, this is Jasmine in a bottle with a touch of creamy shea which is nutty and sweet.The Shea line is my favorite, paired with the conditioner and the cream in the pot that you leave in, it's the ultimate for glossy, ultra smooth hair. The shampoo itself is creamy and thick in color and it looks like pale banana pudding. My hair grew a lot this summer and this shampoo let it stay tangle free and moisturized even though I braid it a lot and often twist it in a bun at work, very nice indeed.I recommend using this with matching conditioner which does a great job of making the hair manageable and silky.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6RO4ILWVJ3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRDPRBW#wasThisHelpful","R1L6RO4ILWVJ3E","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's strange how this is the first time I'm reviewing a piece of music written by Thomas Bergersen, he's one of the composers of the famous Two Steps from Hell, which by the way is the only music I can listen while reading the Game of Thrones books. That story and those guys will forever be intertwined in my head, two years later I'm still a diehard fan of their music as it really rises above the rest so it's no surprise that Thomas partnered with Merethe Soltvedt again, she has sang on a few of his albums ( Enigmatic Soul and False King from the album Invincible, Ocean Princess, Gift of Life, Merchant Prince, Promise, Immortal and Remember Me from the album Illusions, United we Stand Divided we fall, Strength of a Thousand Men and the gorgeous Friendship to Last from album Archangel, All the King's Horses, For the Win and Breathe from the Skyworld album which are really some of my favorite pieces) and also at the live concert last year. This woman is truly the wind beneath those creative sails.This song starts off very pure. Curiously gazing through soft curtains into the morning light sort of a feeling and the vocals that follow sound serene but then they develop into a chasm of power at half point surrounded by dramatic violin work, it's something that grows on you the more you listen to it. This song is very vocally focused which isn't the norm for TSFH familiars, it has a curious and fantastic sound to it though, it's quite beautiful and inspirational for people like myself who like to read ,write or draw to music. It's rich, deep and throbbing at times and the voice is a sweet glaze that makes you addicted to it's enigmatic power.- Kasia S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q2JAR1REP0M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GS5F8Z8#wasThisHelpful","R3Q2JAR1REP0M9","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love spending my free time surrounded by books, lucky me I had two days of nonstop reading last weekend. After finishing four books I had just enough energy to slip this novella into the mix for a nice weekend wrap up. Whisper Lake was my first Melzer read but after a taste Im curious to see what else this guy can come up with. It was pretty short which I actually liked and the writing was crisp and to the point with just enough humor thrown in to make this realistic versus delivering me a bunch of teenagers ready for the butchers block.The story starts of right away, four teens on the verge of adulthood are cruising through the woods on a short trip to their friends cabin in order to help with clean up for new potential buyers. Trevor, Sarah, Amy and Kincaid have all the necessities; cleaning supplies and party supplies as well in forms of beer and smokes. Serenity is broken when they finally get to the cabin only to discover a gristly scene, their grandmother passed away so they didnt expect any signs of life but the disarray alone with bodies of dismembered animals throw them into a loop. Once the shock passes they decide to throw out all the icky bits and get down to cleaning eerie how that comes back to haunt them later. Just when they think that stuff is under control terror strikes them, someone or something is out there observing their every move and it wont leave until the cabin is restored to its former bloody glory.Even though Im a horror lover I was surprised with the authors ease when it came to hacking away at his characters, it was pretty awesome even though I had high hopes for a high survival rate, oh well cant have it all :P This is freaky, gutsy and merciless and certainly an entertaining way to spend a Sunday not to mention how conductive lake, wood and island places are to a good scary story, great stuff.- Kasia S.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7P4TB0FF3KCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMRR3HM#wasThisHelpful","R7P4TB0FF3KCX","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happened to find this single by chance, and by chance I mean by putting ""Two Steps From Hell"" into my Amazon search every few days and desperately scanning the site in hope of some new music. For those who don't know, Thomas Bergersen, the composer of ""Autumn Love"" is in TSFH with Nick Phoenix, another brilliant musical genius. There is nothing like music from them, nothing. I'm always trying to find something similar when I crave more but it's never as good, it comes close-ish but it's not what these guys can offer so anytime there's a single I quickly buy it without even listening. Then it goes on repeat until I love it forever.""Autumn Love"" is luscious piano piece with some string instruments that reminds me of music from his 2011 ""Illusions"" album (formerly called Nemesis II)  it's in that flavor vein. There is a lot of movement that makes me picture light sparkling though amber colored leaves swaying on a tree only to sweetly transforms into a gentle gallop with a depth that gives me goose bumps, it almost sounds like throbbing cellos in the core of the piano until it lifts off effervescently into silence once it's over.

"One of my longtime friends at work, well my boss now, is a longtime big fan of Betsey Johnson so every once in a while I get her a piece as a gift for the holidays or on her birthday with few other things. She hasnt been disappointed yet but she certainly has a very cool style and can pull it off, she makes this fun zany stuff look great. I was excited to see it in person after I placed my order because I was both curious and worried as it was a gift, when I get things for myself its somehow less pressure to deliver perfection. Well, this bracelet was so cute that I instantly wanted it for myself so I knew it was a nice present. Fun statement pieces dont have to be expensive but its best when they look solid and this looks great, good heft and really well set with the black and white enamel, right type of shiny and beautiful. The ballet pink heart crystal in the bows center isnt gaudy and it gives it a fun edge and a sparkle of contrasting color. I tried it on when it arrived because of the reviews that had issues with this bracelet and that is common for all the styles, not just this bow one, few of the hinge style bracelet buyers were unfortunately disappointed. Luckily I didnt have any issues, it snapped in place great. My friend wore it right away and didnt have any issues either, Im guessing that quality control is to blame; some pieces seem to come out perfect while other people get a bad batch perhaps. Boo not nice.Johnson is quite eccentric and this makes for awesome jewelry, I have friends who worked for her as were all in the apparel business and shes a glass of champagne in human form lol, bubbly and then some! Next time Im getting a piece for myself, each series and collection has some special pieces that can perk up even the coziest simple outfit of tank and jeans or what not.- Kasia S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5P4YIYXCPXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQG8D60#wasThisHelpful","R2V5P4YIYXCPXD","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This face cream has the most luscious soft creamy cloud like texture and it spreads wonderfully on the skin. Its almost gilded looking as its tinted from the red tea but wont show on the face as anything but healthy. Im addicted, well its my first time using the African Red Tea line even though Ive been a fan of Ole for the past ten years, and I absolutely love it. In the winter my skin feels extra dry and this makes it relaxed and soft with just one easy layer after washing my face and adding either some Fresh Seaberry oil or the Boscia Tsubaki oil, this on top makes for the best cold skin winter treat. I use this in the PM only and a rich day cream from Avene in the day, I need moisture but this cream seems to do so well at night as I sleep that I reserve it for the time it can truly be potent, its not cheap so stretching it is nice.The scent is also shocking to some, to me it smells exactly like an old favorite, The Body Shops Beer shampoo, man it smelled like candied citrus drowned in a luxe souffl like cake, just delish.- Kasia S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23AME0AC7J9XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019H2KUG#wasThisHelpful","R23AME0AC7J9XV","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love this tub, it's filled to the brim with great quality organic extra virgin coconut oil and it smells divine by the way. Fragrance wise it shouldn't be confused with fresh juicy coconut as this is slightly smoky,  the oil has a delicate toffee like caramel coco tone that only lingers for a bit and doesn't clash with perfume, if anything those lipids will give it extra staying power. When the weather cools this solidifies but I just scoop it out and honestly this rarely leaves my bathroom. My favorite way of using it is after a shower or a bath, a nice thin layer of this oil scooped out and smoothed between the hands all over, it makes for the most luxurious skin treatment that leaves me feeling very relaxed, it's great in the morning if I'm not in a rush, it might take few minutes to skin in but it's especially wonderful at night. After using it I ooze into my bed and sleep deliciously, it's very soothing and spa like, my muscles always feel warm and pampered and it makes for the softest skin, even pricier creams don't work this well, I guess it's the nature and not chemical processes doing all the hard work.This is definitely edible, I know that I tend to use it more as a beauty treatment but many people take coconut oil as a supplement as well , I have cooked curries with it; Thai and Indian types, very tasty but not to be over heated as it can separate. For some reason the Viva labs brand feels better on my skin and hair, I have used the Nature's Way brand and it was good but this feel superior when used on the skin, something about it if beyond soothing and leaves the skin extra smooth, I'm going through a very hard cold winter in NY now and I use this oil in the am and pm after showering, my skin feels beyond soft, a real saver in bad weather when lotions aren't enough. This oil also makes for the best hair treatment, rub some in for a few hours and then shampoo out for the glossiest locks.- Kasia S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D2SL22RWP47P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DS842HS#wasThisHelpful","R1D2SL22RWP47P","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knorr Fix Spaghetti Bolognese might come in the form of a slim little packet but when finished it's a rich, luscious meaty sauce with a blanket of savory tomato gravy specked with piquant oils in teeny tiny pools here and there. Might sound weird but it's so hearty and mouth licking good that just writing this review makes me want to eat some right now, I have to order it since it's tough to find. My mom used to make this for me once in a while as a treat when we lived in Poland so when we moved to America when I was twelve I was very happy to find its own version of it here. It almost tastes the same, few of the options on Amazon come from Germany, that's the last one I tried and it was almost that very same taste I remember.Kudos for mom for finding this, she's a total organic health nut but this she likes and I don't usually cook too much from pre-mixed packets and boxed dinner mixes, frozen veggies and canned legumes is the usual stretch for me but this sauce, oh man, spectacular! Anything can be used for this, ground meat or tofu for veggie lovers with some water and the mix, then it goes over pasta of any shape, Spaghetti noodles being my first choice or even rice or baked potato this will make for a very tasty meal.- Kasia S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMM0TY2VU3M7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P7YT5A#wasThisHelpful","RMM0TY2VU3M7R","AIIR8E34EDKCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIIR8E34EDKCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I must say that I am pretty happy with this indoor/outdoor electric grill. Cooking on it is a snap and it does produce excellent results.  I do use a meat thermometer when using it as I do with both my charcoal and gas grill but I use one if I am preparing meat in the oven or on the stove so this is not big deal.There are a couple of downsides to this grill from my point of view.  They are as follows:The grill plates are not removable so cleaning is more of a chore than it really should be.  I personally simply place my grill by my sink and use plenty of paper towels, warm soapy water and elbow grease.  Again, this is not all that bad and I am not really complaining...just noting.The grill has a very short chord which I suppose was used for safety reasons.  My home, both indoor and outdoor is not wired to cover such short chords which necessitated my using an extension chord...must be a three pronged chord.Other than that all is well.This is an attractive grill and I use it on my screened in back porch, side patio and indeed, even my kitchen at times.  Like I said in the beginning, this thing cooks meat well and is extremely easy to use.Storage is no problem; again, I use the back porch where it is out of the elements.  The grill is easy to assemble out of the box.All in all a very fine product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ITQ04AK9TEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUYI#wasThisHelpful","R15ITQ04AK9TEB","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kitchen machine pretty well works as the product page says.  I will admit right from the start that I am not a big fan of Black & Decker products in general (I really, really dislike most of their tools), but I must admit that I was quite impressed with this slicer and dicer.  It does the job it was meant to perform.My kitchen is filled with different countertop appliances and indeed, I have two different machine which perform the same function as this B&D.  The thing is that these machines, both quite expensive, really perform no better than the one being reviewed here.We eat a tremendous amount of salads and do a lot of entertaining in our home.  This dicer prepares fruits and vegetables perfectly for salad preparation and vegetables for stews, fried potatoes, turnips, beats, etc.  It can prepare very large batches with very little effort and it is an absolute snap when it comes to prepping salads meant for two.I suppose the major features of this machine is that it is much, much easier to clean than other brands and models I have used in the past.  I also like the fact that a separate container comes to store the blades.  Many like machines do not have this feature and the blades are a pure pain to store.Now as to blades...hey folks, these things are SHARP!  Do take great care in handling them as they can deal you out a very series injury if you are not careful.The motor on this unit is extremely strong and the machine is very well built...more so than many other B&D products I have been unfortunate enough to purchase and use over the years.  I am thinking the motor on this one should last a long, long time.The cost here on Amazon is extremely competitive compared to what they are asking locally.I am extremely happy with this thing and as each day and week goes by I am finding more and more uses for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37CVA5P0X1CAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLZM#wasThisHelpful","R37CVA5P0X1CAH","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I do not wear a beard nor do I have to shave my face (thank goodness)...yet, I passed this one along to a brother-in-law whom I am rather fond of...hey, he married my closest sister.  Anyway, He has been delighted with this shaver.  According to him, via a face to face report, the shaver gives him a fast, comfortable and very close shave.  He does have extremely sensitive skin and I did not hear one word of whining pass his lips.He was impressed with the ease in which this thing can e cleaned.  He also liked the fact that it worked equally well as both a wet and dry shaver.  He was also very impressed with the battery life which has been far greater than any model he has ever owned or used.Now I say he did not whine, but I have to tell you that he did mumble something about the replacement heads costing more than several of his beloved birddogs.  I assured him that when the time came that I would take out a loan and cover the cost for him.  That sort of shamed him and I heard no more complaining.Overall his is quite happy with this shaver and since he is not a shy person as to voicing complaints I am content that he is pleased with this shaver which , in turn, pleases me and pleases my sister.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DU0WBQSUBEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R9DU0WBQSUBEH","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No, these will be used by my sister-in-law in her school room.  She has been teaching first grade for a number of years now and is in great need of supplies for her students.  Our local schools system is under the gun as far as budget cuts go, as are many, and my sister-in-law spends quite a lot of money out of her own pocket each year keeping `her kids' in supplies.We did test these scissors and they are quite good...as good as or better than anything else on the market.  They cut well, can be used by left and right handed students, are easy and comfortable to use.

"One of my brothers, who happens to be an English professor and in his spare time teaches and coaches young men and women who are having difficulties in reading (High School kids), directed me toward these books quite a number of years ago.  He uses them (among many others) as books to entice reluctant readers.  He maintains reading is a habit and that the more you read, not unlike sports, the better you will become and the better you become the more you will read.  (I took his advice and applied it to my golf game years ago and hey, it works).Anyway, this book, `Pawn of Prophecy' is the first book in a series which actually includes ten books divided into two series, ""The Belgariad,"" and ""The Malloreon.""  All ten books are one continuous story and to be frank, they need to be read in order to make any sense out of them.This book and this series, is a traditional quest story.  You have several primary characters and a number of characters who show up time and again as the core characters travel a mythological world fighting an ultimate evil.Now these books are not complicated as far as plot goes and there are a lot of repetitions.  Indeed, through the ten books the astute reader will find numerous flaws in the plot (I read one review here where some guy, as a hobby, has identified over 200 plot flaws...actually, blatant errors on the part of the author.  To be honest though, I found this to be part of the charm of these books; that and the verbally duels between characters.Wizardry and magic is involved as are some very unlikely situations.  It simply must be remember though that these books are meant to be FUN TO READ!  If you want serious and bind bending plots look to Martin or one of his ilk.  No, Eddings is simply telling a fun tell to be enjoyed by all.At the core of the story is Garion, a boy raised on a farm who through trial, error and much guidance from his aunt, Polgaria the Sorceress and her father Belgarath (Garion's ultimate grandfather who is 7,000 years old,  becomes...well, King of just about everything.Now these books are good reads for both boys and girls (or men and women) due to the fact that this is one of the first S&S books which featured a dominate female character.The stories are well written, flaws and all, and will keep the pages turning.  I realize that hard core readers of this genre, such as Martin fans, take exception to these books (Hey, I love Martin's work also) but these predated works such as this and I really don't feel their goal was to compete.  These books canoot be classified as ""high literature,"" and indeed, this is yet another part of chair charm.Now keep in mind, the plot in these stories are pretty predictable as are the actions of most of the characters...most of the time.  That is okay though...as I said...these books are meant to be fun and to entertain.Over the years I have given this series multiple readings and still read all ten cover to cover about every two years or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UJHNX7K4NW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345335511#wasThisHelpful","R7UJHNX7K4NW8","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being the only single sister in a very, very large family my home is normally filled with children ages 8 months to 13 years.  The reason for this is that I am the designated `free baby sitter.""  That is okay with me though since I dearly love all my nieces and nephews and would rather see them at my place rather than a day care center or something like that.The latest member of `my gang' is an 8 month old girl.  I have had to restock toys for wee one and this little work table, i.e. baby entertainment center, is a wonderful addition.  I was raised with Fisher Price toys and therefore am a long time fan.My new niece loves this thing.  She is starting to take her first steps now and as soon as she hits the floor when she comes here she heads straight for this thing...makes me sort of jealous being passed by for a table!Noises, flashing lights, strange sounds, and music...what aunt can compete with that.I have found this play table to be quite well made.  It was very easy to set up and after VERY CAREFUL examination I found no dangerous elements to fret about.  My niece loves turning the pages of the little book attached to the top and for some reason is fascinated with the three balls available.  I am trying to teach her to throw already as I plan a future as a pitcher one day soon.Three AA batteries are needed to run some of the elements of this toy but they are easy to change and very secure.  Unlike some, I have had no problems with her sliding the table all over the place.  The only problem I do have is that my three Boston terriers think that the balls belong to them...I have some more training to do it would seem.This is a wonderful toy and my niece, who like most wee one her age has the attention span of a ferret on coffee, stay with this one for great lengths of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SFL39LBTZYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0V3TJE#wasThisHelpful","R6SFL39LBTZYC","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit to being one of those people who have a `thing' for soaps; the more the better and I am constantly trying new flavors.

In my case though, this is the sort of scent I prefer so I am fine with it.Now it may seem to some that this soap is a bit pricy but I can assure you that there are many, many soaps out there that are much more expensive than this one, and in my opinion, not as nice or effective.I feel quite clean after using this soapI have no complaints.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCQMVYJD6NGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9NR476#wasThisHelpful","R3NCQMVYJD6NGT","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having had a grandfather and a great uncle who served and fought in the Korean War, (My great uncle was killed during the Chosen (Hosen) Breakout), I have, since a little girl been pretty well indoctrinated with facts and stories of this horrible conflict.  I know that reading stories of war are not normally a `girl thing' but I have been devouring books on this subject since I was about thirteen.I was familiar with the particular event which is the center portion of this book, i.e. the amazing attempted rescues of a downed pilot by another as I not only have read about it, but listen to it during family discussions.This is truly an inspirational work.  Not only does it show our American warriors at their best, it also gives is a great and detailed account of the life and death of Jesse Brown who was our first NAVY combat pilot and carrier pilot.  That story alone is worth the read of this work.In addition to the above though, the author has given us a good `starter' book as to the outbreak of the Korean War; a subject I find that most young people know little of these days.  This is one of the most brutal wars we have ever been involved in and between wretched government decisions and just plain poor leadership, we almost lost our Marine Corps.While the causes of this war and indeed, accounts of the ground battle are a bit elementary in this work it never the less is a great starting place.More importantly though, this is the story of what bravery under fire and devotion actually is and should be a must read. This tell the story; a well researched story, that Americans need to know of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJNJIC9V4UZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176582#wasThisHelpful","R3CJNJIC9V4UZT","A35A5S6H1WROO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35A5S6H1WROO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you are elderly or infirm, this might be a problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0R53BPZ2TJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMISCW#wasThisHelpful","R1F0R53BPZ2TJT","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's interesting that these towels are marketed as ""decorative bath accessories"".  They are really for show, and little else.  They are very attractive and would go well in a half-bathroom (just toilet and wash basin) where you need something to dry your hands and possibly your face.They are embossed (the word they use is ""embellished"") with an attractive design.  This makes them both more aesthetically appealing and less practical.One oddity is that the two larger items (billed as bath towel and hand towel) have a decorative strip sewn along one edge.  The odd thing is that the bottom of the strip is not sewn on, thus forming a sort of pouch.  Quite why they did this I do not know.Anyway, if you want to add a touch of elegance to your rest room, you should consider these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0IWCJXFWOL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P1HZ6M#wasThisHelpful","R1M0IWCJXFWOL7","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These made-in-India, 100% cotton napkins have a quality look and feel to them.  Really, very nice.Washed and dried according to instructions, there was a shrinkage of nearly an inch each way, and they came out of the dryer very wrinkled, and required ironing.If that sounds practical enough for you, and you want the quality, these are a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKBV5WX8QLY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EL3XVG#wasThisHelpful","R3CKBV5WX8QLY6","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used several MeasuPro products and the quality is consistently good.  This is no exception.  It is accurate and durable.It has an IPX-7 waterproof standard, meaning it is protected against water immersion for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter.  It is machine washable, but personally I feel safer just wiping it clean.I admit to having some trouble understanding how to use the pen-holder sleeve as an extendible handle.  The instructions say, ""Slide the clip of the thermometer cover to the metal holder on the thermometer"".  I eventually figured out what that meant and I can see that it would be useful.  A diagram would have been nice.  Using the pen-holder sleeve to keep the thermometer in a pocket is problematic because it is so top heavy.  That's not a problem for me because I would never carry it around.I received a free sample of this product in return for an honest review, which is the only kind I give anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVEBM0FBFMW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB7KNRM#wasThisHelpful","R1JVEBM0FBFMW9","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thick, durable and attractive placemats, in a rich, pleasing color.  They are a good size and it is useful that they come in sets of 6 and not just 4.The washing instructions are not on a sewn-on label but on a removable sticker.  I washed them, following the instructions closely.  There was no color loss, but there was noticeable shrinkage.  Also, they crumpled up and needed to be stretched out.  The only way to do it would be to steam iron them flat.  For me, that's a deal breaker, as place mats are likely to get soiled often and need to be easy to launder.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NW1IZEC4Z2AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026IBERM#wasThisHelpful","R3NW1IZEC4Z2AC","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used Cascade Dishwasher Detergent Action Pacs for some time now and am very pleased with them.  They are clean and convenient and do a good job.  I usually use the Complete version and I have to say I think they do a somewhat better job than these.Take care to keep the contents dry, otherwise you start them dissolving.  Also keep the pacs away from toddlers, because they may be attractive to little hands and mouths.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20K5L6QZL38QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JQ8FR8#wasThisHelpful","R20K5L6QZL38QK","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
