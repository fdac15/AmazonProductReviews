Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Detects and Cleans OUT-GASSING FROM PLASTICS etc,I did not buy this from Amazon because they were charging $199 and I found it at Sylvane for $160 with free shipping 12/18/12. Now, 1 week later Amazon is selling it for $159.My unit did come with a remote. I don't know if I received old stock or Winix decided to start shipping with the remote again because of complaints. It is easier to use the remote than the buttons on the unit and the remote is the only way to turn off the Plasma Wave.I have had this air purifier for one week now. For a product like this I usually wait months before reviewing it to determine it's effectiveness and faults if any. This product was very effective detecting and cleaning out-gassing from a new memory foam mattress.I bought this primarily for:1) cleaning the air of out-gassing from plastics/synthetics, paint, particle board, carpet etc.2) No one in the family has any allergies, but I was interested in lowering the pollen, mold spores and dust especially in spring and summer when we all get runny noses from time to time.3) I have a 5yr old son and want to keep the indoor air as clean as possible for his health.IT WORKS FOR DETECTING AND CLEANING PLASTIC/SYNTHETICS OUT-GASSING:I bought a memory foam topper to soften up a hard mattress and it feels great. However there were many complaints about chemical smell and that it needs a few days to air out before using. When I received it, I noticed a minor smell but used it that night since I am not sensitive to the odor.2.5" Lucid by LinenSpa Gel Infused Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper with Removable Bamboo Cover, QUEEN****This product detected the new mattress odor the 1st night and and while on auto kicked into #3 speed for about 45min. The air quality meter was at 4 bars of 5 and gradually declined to "good air quality". This has continued for several days now even though I can't smell it anymore. (note I use the air purifier in the living room during the day and move it into the bedroom an hour before going to bed. Probably will but a second unit next month.****I now have a 2nd unit so I don't have to move it from living room to bedroom at night and then move it again in the morning.I found that when I leave it off at night in the living room when everyone is sleeping, in the morning when I turn it on after it warms up, the air quality meter jumps to 3-4 bars (bad air) and kicks the fan up for 30-45min. I'm the 1st one up in the morning so no dust has been kicked up from us.For LIGHT SLEEPERS like me:For use in the bedroom I use a timer to shut the unit off between 4am and 5am when I am most likely to wake up from fan noise. The unit is very quiet at speed 1). Speed 2) is also quiet but can wake me up at around 5am. The timer I use is Belkin Conserve Socket F7C009q Energy-Saving Outlet. It can be set for 30 min, 3 hours and 6 hours. So, I set it for 6 hours and turn it on at 10pm. It shuts off the air cleaner at 4am. Perfect for me.Power consumption by fan speed:Off 1.3WAuto) 5W1) 5W2) 15W3) 38W4) Turbo 77WFan noise:1) Very difficult to hear in a very quiet room at night.2) Minor white noise, fine for daytime use but may be too noisy for light sleepers.3) Sound kicks up a few notches, fine for brief periods but too much for all day use.4 Turbo loudPlasma Wave noise:None. I can only hear something when the fan is on #1 low and I listen at the air outlet vent.If you are concerned "Plasma Wave" will produce Ozone or you are highly sensitive get the WAC5500 which comes with a remote that does allow you to turn off the "Plasma Wave".My modifications:Surprisingly these all fit1) I added a second charcoal filter to increase the effectiveness of cleaning odor and synthetics out-gassing. Carbon filters are VERY IMPORTANT to cleanse the air of very small pollutants. Pollutants too small for the HEPA filter to catch. Change the carbon more often than 3 months. You can buy cut to fit ACTIVATED CARBON filters here on Amazon for 7-10$ for 2.2) I bought a washable pre-filter to keep dust from blocking the charcoal's cleaning and extend the life of the Hepa filter. This prefilter is a little narrow on the width by 1/4" but works well Duck Brand 1285234 24-Inch by 15-Inch by 1/4-Inch Foam Air Conditioner FilterCharcoal filter vs Activated carbon:They have similar cleaning abilities but Activated Carbon is many times more effective than charcoal or carbon. For those that want to know, here is why: Activated carbon is processed carbon or charcoal. It is processed with steam to create millions microscopic holes and channels that trap the sub micron particles that pollute your air and that can't be cleaned by the hepa filter. Activated carbon is used commercially to purify air and drinking water. I will be replacing the charcoal filter with Activated carbon filter. Cut-to-fit Carbon for Air PurifiersAir quality sensor:I was skeptical about the air quality sensor but it has detected cooking odors and plastic outgassing so far. My only concern is how long will it work. Most sensors need some maintenance (more than the vacuuming recommended in the manual). But maybe it's not important in the long run as you become confident the air cleaner works and you change the carbon filters at the recommended 3 months or sooner.A little about me: I am a practicing Electronic Engineer with over 20 yrs experience analyzing electronic components and engineering modifications to improve performance or fix defects.The price performance of this product is very good. I rate it 5 stars.Thank you to all the reviewers of this product and other air purifiers sold on Amazon.

But, don't let a 200+ pounder sit on it.Concept and execution is good for a foldable ottoman. When folded up for storage everything fits it the lid. Very convenient.Materials are average quality but in line with the cost. ($23)Workmanship is reasonably good and also better than average considering the price.I like it. Glad I bought it.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,3,Not reliable 2 of 3 not usable after 6mo,I searched many reviews looking for decent quality iPhone 4S cables and tried these sold by BLUECELL POWER for $10.These cables look good like good quality and the connector fits the iPhone 4S and iPad well.But,Now 6 months later 2 of 3 are not working. Nothing visible broken. One cable was intermittent for about a month, so I suspect a broken wire inside the cable or connector. Who knows?I am not rough on cables so these should have been fine.Now (Nov 2012) these are selling for $3.50 for 3 cables and shipped from Hong Kong. Probably worth the new price. I'll try these again.Good luck finding a good reliable cable for long term use.

Construction and steel is good but not high end heavy duty like "Steel case" or other more expensive heavy use equipment.This is a letter size cabinet that will fit legal hanging folders with the included bracket.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Perfect fit for iPad2 with cover,For about $10 this case is perfect for carrying my iPad2. Fit is great with my iPad AND cover. The neoprene material feels like it will protect my iPad if I drop it. (I always use a fold over cover) The outside zip pocket is decent sized to carry cable(s) and charger with room to spare.It has 2 zipper pulls. Great for left or right handed.Workmanship is good. Material quality is good. Zipper is heavy duty, but zips and unzips smoothly and effortlessly.The only downside is that neoprene has a thin cloth outer layer (the black cloth) that will probably wear quickly from normal abrasion (especially) corners. I knew this when I bought it, so for me it is not a negative.Would definitely buy it again!!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,December 2, 2012,B002VPE1Q6,AmazonBasics iPad Air and Netbook Bag with Handle Fits 7 to 10-Inch Tablets (Black),Computers & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1Q6,AmazonBasics,$9.99
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,4,My 5yr old boy still LOVES this thing after 6 MONTHS,My 5yr old boy still loves this thing EVEN after 6 months. Part of it is a boy's fascination with lights and flashlights. He takes it to bed most every night and brings it in the living room every morning. He loves it like a 2yr old with a favorite blanket or stuffed bear. It cost $30 at Walmart, which I thought was high for what it is. But he loves it still, so in the end it was worth the money.Durability-so far very good. I see no signs of seams coming apart or the material deteriorating. Surprisingly even the cream colored belly is still clean.Batteries: Still on the the same set. There is a switch on the bottom for "on" and"timer". I have it set on timer. TIMER HAS SAVED A LOT OF MONEY ON BATTERIES!!!Light show is good at night in a dark room with night lite on. He loves the stars and penguin face moon on the ceiling. To me it was surprisingly bright on the ceiling. Easy to see, bit not bright enough to keep him awake. You can look directly at the lights and not worry about eye damage like many flashlights. It changes colors every few minutes. When the colors change the light dims changes to a new color and then slowly brightens. There are several colors. I'm guessing 4.Changing batteries. There is one Philips screw that holds the battery compartment lid closed. Good idea to keep the little ones from getting at the batteries.Overall a great purchase since he still loves it and it still works.Maybe I'm not fair but I took off 1 star for price only. I think $27 to $30 is a bit high.I was surprised to see a lot of negative reviews. Other than the non-functional units, the rest of the complaints are not reasonable.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,December 16, 2012,B008LDDXT8,Pillow Pets Dream Lites - Playful Penguin 11",Toys & Games,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LDDXT8,Pillow Pets,$9.00

Paid about $12.50 and very happy with the value.Highlights:1) Comes with inexpensive cordura type case with zip closure. It has elastic bands to hold the stapler and staples in place. Decent package for the price.2) Staples are close to the same size as office staples.3) Easily and completely penetrates the ff: Drywall, 2X4, hard board (used for chairs) and surprisingly regular wood on my kitchen cabinet doors. (may not completely penetrate hardwood. I did not test that)4) Includes 1000 staples in convenient plastic case.5) WARNING: Requires relatively strong grip to operate the stapler.6) Easy to load staples.If this review was helpful to you, please click "yes".

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great lamp! good white light output and 3 brightness levels,Summary first:I received the gray. An excellent color with aluminum accents. I think it looks better in person than in the pictures.The base is plastic with metal inside and heavy enough for stability. The lamp is made of good quality plastic and some metal. Overall solid quality construction. The LED's are recessed in the thin lamp arm section so they don't shine in your eyes. The diffuser works well and evenly lights work area with no glare. Power consumption is very low at 8.4W on max brightness. The lamp is just barely warm after hours of use. Lamp control is by touch button similar to a touch screen on a smartphone. Touch button is lighted when off. There is no separate on/off button.I love this lamp and would not hesitate to buy it again.Light output: Max 500 lumen. For comparison 400 Lumens= 40W incandescent and 800 Lumens= 60W incandescent. Keep in mind that this lamps light is reflected down so it will appear to put out more light.Dimming: 3 levels. No separate on/off, so you have to cycle down from high, med, low to off. No big deal for me. Touch control works well similar to a smart phone touch screen.Light color: Halfway between warm white and bright white on the color spectrum. A good choice in my opinion. Not too white like office fluorescent lighting.Light diffuser: Works well. You can easily see the individual LED's looking directly at them, but the lamp diffuser evenly lights your desk or work area. The LED lamp arm swivels about 15 degrees.Adjustability of lamp:1) BASE swivels only 45 degrees left or right. 90 degrees or more would be much better, but not a deal breaker for me.2) VERTICAL arm adjusts nearly flat front or back. (almost 90 degrees forward and almost 90 degrees backwards.3) LAMP ARM will fold down flush with the vertical arm and 45 degrees higher than horizontal. Sorry if that description is confusing.4) LAMP ARM TILT is only about 15 degrees. This is enough tilt to keep the lamp from shining in your eyes.Note: The lamp joint(s) do creek a little when brand new. This does not last long.LED life:You should NEVER have to replace any of the LED's. They are made of silicon. The same stuff as your computer microprocessors are made from (Intel) though the manufacturing process is much different. The built in power supply is much more likely to fail before any of the LED's.Note: Not this model, but some models from this company have an AC adapter (110V-220V) that can be replaced if it goes bad. Prism TLC-4300BK Multi-Function LED Desk Lamp with Anti-Glaring Filter , BlackPower consumption:OFF: 0 WattsHigh 8.4 WattsMed 4.4 Wattslow 2.5 WattsMeasured using Belkin Conserve Insight Energy-Use MonitorSwitched outlet: The lamp does not remember the last setting if used on switched outlet.Emergency Lighting: Since this lamp uses so little power it can be used as emergency lighting if you have some type of emergency power source either generator or battery with 12 DC to AC 110V.LED lighting costs have come down a lot but are still expensive. Still a good value at less than $100 considering the LED's will last a very long time, good light color, 3 light levels and excellent construction, materials and very low power consumption.I also have the Prism TLC-4300BK (more expensive) that has 3 light color option and a few extra features. I always use it on the white color.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great Quality, good fit, Timberland quality,I always buy good quality shoes. They will last a long time if you take care of them.These shoes fit true to size for me (12D) with a little extra room but not too loose. I like the extra room, so I can wear thick socks on cold days.These shoes are a bit heavier in weight than my other shoes, but not so much that I notice it when wearing them..The leather quality and finish is excellent on the oiled brown . These can be oiled (my choice) or polished or both. Oiling helps keep the leather soft and moisturized and looking good for a long time. It also helps repel water. I use Leather Honey Leather Conditioner, the Best Leather Conditioner 8oz Bottle on all my shoes and belts once a year minimum. It will darken some light color leathers, but usually lightens near the original color after a few days.The soles of these shoes are a little thicker and have deeper traction treads than other casual shoes I have but not so much as to look like hiking shoes. Perfect for dressy casual.These shoes do require a little longer to break in than other shoes I have. But once broken it they are even better.This is my first purchase of Timberland casual shoes. Overall very good shoes, high quality and comfortable. Would definitely buy these again.Tip:My feet sweat a lot in hot, and cold weather. So, after a days use the inside of my shoes are damp and that eventually causes smelly shoes. A few months ago I saw this shoe dryer on Amazon's gold box specials and bought it: PEET Dryer M97-FSB Original 2-Shoe Electric Dryer, Black . In the few months I've had it, my shoe odor has declined dramatically. My son has the same feet as me, so I use it on his stinky shoes to. :) Note that it only helps reduce foot odor if you use it while the shoes are damp. Does nothing if your shoes are dry already. This dryer does not have a timer or on/off switch, so I use Belkin Conserve Socket F7C009q Energy-Saving Outlet and set it for 3 hours. Works great.Ships from and sold by Amazon for $78.50 excluding sales tax,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,January 1, 2013,B0043QNSW4,Timberland Men's City Endurance Slip-On,Shoes,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043QNSW4,Timberland,$159.00

I received it quickly from Amazon. Put in the battery, turned it on, etcThe first time adjusting the light up and down one side of the plastic "C" brackets broke. There are 2 "C" brackets that hold the light by the battery holder. I was not rough with it. I looked over the design carefully and decided not to get a replacement as I thought it would break again sooner or later.Thank you Amazon for your return policy.. That and good prices keeps me coming back.This happened about 6mo.s ago.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Exactly as expected at a GOOD PRICE,I've been shopping for a fire (security) safe for months now and until now couldn't find one that had relatively good reviews and at a reasonably price.We've all read the other reviews and I agree and confirm most everything. It arrived in perfect condition by UPS. Paint finish is quite good and has a thin oily residue. The interior was clean, and the caulking around plastic interior and steel case was applied well. The shelf is thin and sags readily with any weight (My documents will be on this shelf.) The plastic combo dial works well and has loud clicks. Numbers are easy to see in low light. The key lock is nice for extra security should someone learn your combo. Exterior hinge? Not the best idea. The door inside has a pocket that fits a small frame pistol such as a 380.To in icrease weight: On the bottom of the safe I put about 20 boxes of 40cal ammo. In addition I will keep 5 handguns and some valuables. This adds at least 50lbs+. Now it's VERY difficult to move.I have no illusions that these safes will protect valuables from a determined thief. Safes actually would be one of the first things a thief would want because valuables are normally concentrated there. My safe will be a DECOY and have documents, passports and a few handguns. Other valuables (emergency cash, gold, expensive coins) will be stashed elsewhere inconspicuously out of sight.Hope this helps you.Note: Once the safe is opened it can be locked and unlocked with the key only as long as the combo dial isn't turned. You need to turn the combo dial to relock it completely.Note 2-27-13 (1 year): I use Eva-dry Renewable E-333 Wireless Mini Dehumidifer to keep the safe dry for a year now. The safe must be reasonably well sealed, One of these keeps my save very dry at &lt; 40% relative humudity.I am quite happy with the purchase. Thanks to all of you that reviewed this and other safes.Note:Ships from and sold by Amazon.com,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 5, 2012,B005P12F2K,SentrySafe SFW123DSB 1.23 Cubic Feet Combination Fire-Safe, Medium Grey,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P12F2K,SentrySafe,$163.52
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great for back up-using your old 2.5" drive,I was pleasantly surprised at the overall good quality of everything in this package.a)The drive enclosure is well made and fits the 2.5" (laptop) drive perfectly. Power switch is a good feature, so you can turn off power before moving/disconecting drive.b) Includes screws and screwdriver to attach to drive to holder.c) Well made USB cable. Requires to 2 USB ports. The 2nd port is for extra power. One of the USB plugs has a pass through so you only need one open port on your pc.d) Comes with a very nice padded case for drive holder only. Would have been nice to add a place for the cables as well. The case has a magnetic closure. Magnets will erase magnetic media like harddrives but probably is ok since the case covers are metal(steel) which will shield the drive. The magnet is not powerful either.e) The product box is very good quality and is great for storing drive and cables between uses. Everything fits inside easilyf) Using the drive the 1st time was easy. Windows 7 recognized the drive and installed drivers automatically.g) The case becomes warm after backing up entire system (30min). About 30min to backup 40gig.. Not bad for USB 2.0. Back up did not slow down my system at all, so I could continue my work.h)Includes mini CD with instructions and drivers for older versions of windows and Mac's.There are other drive holders on Amazon for about $8 on up.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great idea for a toy, no limits for childrens imagination,I bought this set one year ago in June 2012.My boy was almost 5yrs old at the time. He didn't play with them the 1st few months. I helped him for several months. He gradually starting making very simple things on his own and has steadily made more complicated things. Now he can make anything his imagination can dream up.I think it is important to emphasize not to worry if your child is not interested in this toy at first. He or she will gradually start making things and as time passes you will be surprised at how many things they make.This is the only toy he has has not become bored with....to me this is amazing.Price: Expensive no doubt.. Now 1 year later I feel the cost was well worth it.Quality: Very good. Strong magnets, good quality wood, good wood finish. AFter 1 years use I have seen no damage to any of the blocks. Very pleased.Imagination: No limit for the kido's. They learn to make whatever is on their mind.Easy to use: Because of the magnets and no need for fasteners this toy is great for the younger children.Note: This set does go on sale occasionally here on Amazon and at Tegu's website. I paid less than $100,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,July 20, 2013,B003UNRBPG,52 Piece Tegu Original Magnetic Wooden Block Set, Natural,Toys & Games,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UNRBPG,Tegu,$125.00

I was grinding up calcium pills and putting it in his food, but often forgot.These taste GREAT. He reminds me after every meal to get his vitamins. He's also taking the Lil Critters Gummy Bear Vitamins.1 reviewer complained about the taste.

It is lightly padded.b) The mirror is beveled and does not distort.c) The back panel that holds the mirror in place is plywood and painted to match. See my photod: This mirror is a full 6' tall. It is large so check the dimensions.e) It is heavy, but I had no problem moving it.I have mine in the corner of my living room in a vertical position.

Great for emergency snack to at 160 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.The APPLE CRISP is my favorite flavor!GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46 cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 6 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 11 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium. Protein 3 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 2 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.Crunchy: These can be messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!I also have the chocolate and they are very good, but this is my favoriteEnjoy, I do.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,April 21, 2012,B001EQ5HPW,none,none,none,none,none

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,5 stars & Good buy at the RIGHT PRICE, February 12, 2012,I bought this from Amazon for 10.19. For this price it's a great case. Material quality is OK not great, however workmanship is good.You have access to all ports, switches, speakers and cameras when open. You cannot charge it with the cover closed. One horizontal position (see pics), and one vertical position. Overall a good design.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Detects and Cleans OUT-GASSING FROM PLASTICS etc,I did not buy this from Amazon because they were charging $199 and here in Texas Amazon has to charge 6.25% sales tax. I bought this one on Ebay for $185 free shipping.WAC5300 $159 vs WAC5500 $199. I have 2 WAC5300's and 1 WAC5500.WAC55001) This model does come with a remote. The remote is very useful turning it on and changing fan speeds. It is the only way to turn off the plasma wave.2) Washable Hepa filter. I have serious doubts that you can effectively wash a Hepa filter. There are no instructions for cleaning it either.3) External color4) On fan speed #2 this unit (5500) is quieterI have had this air purifier for 2 months now. It works great for us. I use it mostly on the 2nd lowest speed #2. The air in the bedroom where I use this one is always very fresh now. This model is a little quieter than the 5300. Both my 5300's you can hear the motor making a faint whining sound on speed #2 only. The 5500 does not make this sound making it best for the bedroom.I bought this primarily for:1) cleaning the air of out-gassing from plastics/synthetics, paint, particle board, carpet etc.2) No one in the family has any allergies, but I was interested in lowering the pollen, mold spores and dust especially in spring and summer when we all get runny noses from time to time.3) I have a 5yr old son and want to keep the indoor air as clean as possible for his health.IT WORKS FOR DETECTING AND CLEANING PLASTIC/SYNTHETICS OUT-GASSING:I bought a memory foam topper to soften up a hard mattress and it feels great. However there were many complaints about chemical smell and that it needs a few days to air out before using. When I received it, I noticed a minor smell but used it that night since I am not sensitive to the odor. (2.5" Lucid by LinenSpa Gel Infused Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper with Removable Bamboo Cover, QUEEN)****This product detected the new mattress odor the 1st night and and while on auto kicked into #3 fan speed for about 45min. The air quality meter was at 4 bars of 5 and gradually declined to "good air quality". This continued for several days even though I couldn't smell it anymore.**** I smoke outside (never inside) and both models occasionally detect the small amount of smoke left in my lungs when I come in the house. This truly surprised me.For LIGHT SLEEPERS like me:For use in the bedroom I use a timer to shut the unit off between 4am and 5am when I am most likely to wake up from fan noise. The unit is very quiet at speed 1). Speed 2) is also quiet but can wake me up at around 5am. The timer I use is Belkin Conserve Energy Saving Outlet. It can be set for 30 min, 3 hours and 6 hours. So, I set it for 6 hours and turn it on at 10pm. It shuts off the air cleaner at 4am. Perfect for me.Power consumption by fan speed:Off 1.3WAuto) 5W1) 5W2) 15W3) 38W4) Turbo 77WFan noise:1) Very difficult to hear in a very quiet room at night.2) Minor white noise, fine for daytime use but may be too noisy for light sleepers.3) Sound kicks up a few notches, fine for brief periods but too much for all day use.4 Turbo loudPlasma Wave noise:None. I can only hear something when the fan is on #1 low and I listen at the air outlet vent.My modifications:Surprisingly these all fit1) I added a second charcoal filter to increase the effectiveness of cleaning odor and synthetics out-gassing. Carbon filters are VERY IMPORTANT to cleanse the air of very small pollutants. Pollutants too small for the HEPA filter to catch. Change the carbon more often than 3 months. You can buy cut to fit ACTIVATED CARBON filters here on Amazon for 7-10$ for 2.2) I bought a washable pre-filter to keep dust from blocking the charcoal's cleaning and extend the life of the Hepa filter. This prefilter is a little narrow on the width by 1/4" but works well Duck Brand 1285234 24-Inch by 15-Inch by 1/4-Inch Foam Air Conditioner FilterCharcoal filter vs Activated carbon:They have similar cleaning abilities but Activated Carbon is many times more effective than charcoal or carbon. For those that want to know, here is why: Activated carbon is processed carbon or charcoal. It is processed with steam to create millions microscopic holes and channels that trap the sub micron particles that pollute your air and that can't be cleaned by the hepa filter. Activated carbon is used commercially to purify air and drinking water. I will be replacing the charcoal filter with Activated carbon filter. Cut-to-fit Carbon for Air PurifiersAir quality sensor:I was skeptical about the air quality sensor but it has detected some cooking odors and plastic out-gassing so far.My only concern is how long will it work and I seriously doubt it will detect everything. Most sensors need some maintenance (more than the vacuuming recommended in the manual). ****But maybe it's not important in the long run as you become confident the air cleaner works and you change the carbon filters at the recommended 3 months or sooner.A little about me: I am a practicing Electronic Engineer with over 20 yrs experience analyzing electronic components and engineering modifications to improve performance or fix defects.The price performance of this product is very good. I rate it 5 stars.Thank you to all the reviewers of this product and other air purifiers sold on Amazon.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,4,Part of an insomnia cure,I have had problems with insomnia for many years. I went to sleep specialists and the best they could offer was various prescriptions. I eventually settled on taking klonopin 1mg before bed. This did help but was not a cure.A few years ago with the help of the web to do research I found several things that help and many that do nothing (for me):L-Theanine 200mg in the morning with coffee - makes me feel rested nearly all day. I stopped needing coffee in the early afternoon. Greatly reduced occasional mild to moderate anxiety. I feel great all day even if I did not get enough sleep.Nutraspray melatonin - 1 spray (1.5mg) usually puts me to sleep in 20 minutes. I've been using this for several months and it's effectiveness has not declined. (I've tried melatonin caps before and they did not help) This does not help me get back to sleep if I wake up after 5 hours.5 HTP- Tried this a few years ago and it worked for a while until I started have wild dreams and had to stop taking it. I kept the bottle. I recently started taking 5HTP again but only took 1/4 (25mg) capsule and that worked great. Helps me sleep the entire night without the wild dreams.Mucuna Dopa- Does seem to help sleep through the night although I do not take it every night and take only 1/4 cap or 25mg.I've written this review to give fellow insomniacs some ideas and to encourage you not to give up trying to find a non pharmaceutical treatment for sleep disorders.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 16, 2013,B004PPTW3W,5-HTP 100mg, 120 Vegetarian Capsules - The GOLD Standard Pure 5-HTP Extract Guaranteed Free of Harmful Peak-X, GMOs, and Allergens,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PPTW3W,Nutrex Research, Inc.,$29.32
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,I use Tufoil BEFORE engine problems,I tried Tufoil many years ago after reading about it in popular mechanics. Then, my Nissan pick-up was making loud valve tappet rattling noise ONLY in the morning for a few seconds. I put some tufoil in it and by the 3rd day the morning rattling was gone. Never came back.Next vehicle was a Toyota pick-up turbo 5 spd manual... The 1st gear was very tight. Many times at a stop light I had to put it in reverse to roll it slightly to get it into 1st gear. I knew Tufoil would help but it was a pain to get to the manual transmission oil filler hole, but I eventually did it. It took about a month to see some improvemnet, but it did gradually get better until it was very easy shifting.I have put this in new cars after the break-in and ran them years until I sold them private party. Always got top dollar partly because the engine sounded so good. I am still using it.I just bought an Infinity G25 and added it after the break-in was complete (6,000 miles) I put in my lawn mower and air compressor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great point and shoot for those that don't want to be a camera expert to get good pictures,This is what I have been looking for. Thanks to the reviews on Amazon I was able to narrow my search down to this camera series.Great point and shoot camera for people like myself who want excellent pics without becoming an expert or reading the manual.8X optical zoom is every good, except it is a bit jerky during adjustment.Image stabilization in the IA mode works well esp when taking pictures of my son who can't stay still.IA mode also switches to macro mode automatically when needed.Face tracking for auto-focus is great and will track more than one face or object.Low light pics are good without flash.Menu is not difficult to learn (without manual). Basic functions require just one or two steps (button pushes.With the timer and tripod mount I can take family pictures without dad usually missing. :)I have a good camera (12mp) with flash in my phone. But it has no timer, red eye reduction, macro mode and can't be mounted on a tripod.I bought this camera to sell some of my coin collection on Ebay. These are expensive coins and I have been able to get great pictures without a lot of trial and error. I've been getting top dollar for the coins because the pictures are clear and detail is excellent.Very pleased with this camera. It has a lot more features that I have not listed. I see no need to upgrade this camera for many years.You will need to buy a flash memory card. I strongly suggest you get a good quality high speed card. SDHC class 10. Check the reviews before you buy the card. With a fast card you can take good video as well as little or no delay between still shots without flash.This is not the touch screen model.Wait for this to go on sale.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,WINTER BLUES GONE IN 2 DAYS,I was diagnosed having a mild to medium case of SAD (winter blues) about 15ys ago.. Most of you know the symtoms from just feeling down with little motivation all the way to depression.15years ago you had to make your own light box or pay several hundred $$$ for one, if you could find one. I live in the central to southern US and still get some "winter blues" from weeks of cloudy days and working indoors all day.The unit:A)For the money it is well built of medium thickness plastic. It does have a slight plastic odor that dissapates in about a week. (1 yr update: I can still smell plastic after the light has been on for 15min or so. I just ignore the smell, since the benefit from the light is so good.)B)The ionizer: I will not use it because it produces OZONE WHICH WILL DAMAGE YOUR LUNGS OVER TIME. The ozone does produce a fresh air smell that I like, but at the recommended 12" distance it is too close to the nose and you will be inhaling OZONE and not the fresh air smell. SO PLEASE LEAVE IT OFF WHEN IT IS CLOSE TO YOUR FACE.C)Simple on/off each for the ionizer, light on/off, and then a separate timer button with 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute settings.D)The Light: The glare is too much for me facing directly into the light. I place the light at the side of my face at about the 10 or 2 o'clock position. This reduces the eye strain especially if you have light sensitive eyes like mine. The bright light may seem too much the 1st few days to a week. but personlly I have become used to it already and actually enjoy it now after a few weeks.The results: EXCELLENT!!! My winter blues diminished within a few days. After a week I felt GREAT (back to normal). I now don't look forward to spring and summer to feel better. I only look forward to the warmer weather.DO NOT USE in the late afternoon or evening. Using it late in the day will temporarily alter your circadian rhythm (day/night sleep cycle) and you may not be able to sleep well at night.Summary: Great COST EFFECTIVE way to treat the winter blues caused by the shorter days of winter and/or long periods of cloudy weather any time of year.WARNING: I repeat my unit produces a fair amount of OZONE that will damage lungs over time. DO NOT USE THE IONIZER when the unit is close to your face.Stars 5 because: The unit effectively cured my winter blues (SAD) quickly and at a good price.I was tempted to take 1 star off for the ionizer but did not because the light works so well.Thanks for all the reviews.1 year update (Jan 2013): I started using this lamp early this year in November and found I need only 15 minutes if i use it almost every day. On weekends, I can use it for 30min/day.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,LOW COST DAYLIGHT, BRIGHT WHITE also helps with SAD,Never thought I would be writing a review for light bulbs. But because of all the irrelevant, uninformed and nit picky negatives I am writing this one.Shipment came boxed and wrapped in double layer bubble wrap with no broken bulbs. All worked.Daylight CFL bulbs are normally very expensive compared to standard warm white or white CFL's. These 4 bulbs are a bargain delivered for $11 plus no sales tax. Most of you know that already.These are 5000K on the color spectrum which better reproduces daylight than the standard white at 6500K. These bulbs start-up the same as other CFL's in that it takes a few minutes to get to full brightness.Much more light than than standard warm white (2700K)Basics of CFL colors: 2700K is warm white, 3200-3500 is white. 5000K (this bulb) is the closest to daylight color, so it's bright natural white. 6500K is (bluish) white but higher on the visible light spectrum and not as good as the 5000K (daylight).Bulb life: I have been using CFL's for about 8 years now. I've used many brands from cheap to moderately expensive. All brands I've used have about a 10-20% failure rate after a month or 2. None last their rated life. Bulbs fail earlier when they are frequently turned on and off.These daylight bulbs can help with SAD (seasonal affect disorder) where the shorter days of winter and cloudy weather cause mild to moderate depression for many people.SAD (seasonal affect disorder)My first use of these bulbs is in the bathroom. I have a light fixture that takes 4 of these. WOW!! What a difference these make over the warm white bulbs. You can really can see yourself and skin color etc as you would look in natural daylight.The 4 bulbs (240W equivalent) will also help my SAD on workdays I have no time to sit in front of my SAD lamp. The wattage in my bathroom (240W) is high enough where I get a good dose of natural light every morning.I will buy this brand again if the price continues to be competitive and they are still available.Sold by: DEALS AND MORE Fulfilled by AmazonUpdate: I've been using these bulbs in my bathroom for almost 2 years.

Circuit boards have been shrinking for decades and it is difficult to see/inspect many of the details.I took a chance and ordered this one because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and was not disappointed.This magnifier is great because:a) Low cost for what it does.b) No distortion.c) Easy to focus.d) Excellent lighting. Bright white LED evenly lights magnified area.e) Shape and size of the body/handle makes it easy to hold.f) LED lighting means batteries will last a LONG TIME.g) Magnifier lense is a good size at 3".

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,4,Keeps my ammo dry, but uses a lot of ENERGY to recharge,I've used these cobalt blue silica beads before in a industrial application. They are very effective in a SEALED environment. They can be recharged 100's of time if they are kept clean of oil or grease. (clean oven)The color change from blue (dry) to pink (saturated) is easy to see in the small window.Recharge in an oven at 300 for 3hrs is good option, but it is a lot of energy. If they had a ceramic case, these could be recharged in a microwave in 5 minutes.This product keeps my sealed ammo box dry to &lt;35% relative humidity. These are a little small for most safes if you open it often and/or the safe is not sealed.For higher capacity drying check out EVA DRY: Eva-dry Renewable EDV-300/E-333 Wireless Mini Dehumidifer &lt;$20. I have two of these now and it dries my 1.2 cu. ft. safe very quickly (after opening). The unit has a built-in heater to recharge itself.. To recharge/renew it plug the unit into a wall outlet for up to 8hrs. I really like this unit. Keeps my 1.2cu ft safe dry &lt;40% RH and still declining 3wks later.Note: The humidity will gradually decline over time as the contents of the safe (or any sealed container) release moisture as they are drying.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 24, 2012,B0018O035O,40 Gram Indicating Desiccant Silica Gel Canister, Fits Pelican 1500D Peli Cases,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O035O,Fairly Odd Treasures LLC - Sporting Goods,$6.99
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Better than an Energy Boost - Feel Rested all day - No Anxiety,I have been taking about 400 mg in my morning coffee for more than a month now. I now feel good and rested ALL DAY. The effect lasts all day and into the evening. Needless to say my quality of life has improved dramatically.Now for me this is amazing since I've had sleeping problems for more than 20 years. Before I started taking this, I would start to feel tired around noon.I also experience mild to moderate anxiety regularly (but not daily) that has improved some by taking Magnesium Malate. I have not experienced any anxiety since taking L-Theanine.I no longer need or want to drink coffee in the afternoon anymore.This is the only brand L-Theanine I have tried.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,September 29, 2015,B0093UHQPA,L-Theanine - 50 Grams (1.76 Oz) - 99+% Pure - FBA - 250 Servings - Dietary Supplement - HPLC tested,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093UHQPA,LiftMode,$15.88

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,4,EXCELLENT DESIGN & Much EASIER than JUMPER CABLES,Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up) Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,December 10, 2012,B000JFHNQA,Booster PAC ES5000 1500 Peak Amp 12V Jump Starter,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JFHNQA,Clore Automotive,$109.04

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Everything about these coasters is High Quality,Not many people would consider paying $35 for coasters, but if you're in the market seriously consider Decasso's coasters. Every detail on this set is perfect. Even the felt on the bottom is top quality. The leather is definitely high quality top grain leather. The holder is beautiful in it's simplicity. The leather on the holder is sewn where the leather is folded over (front opening and top edge). You can't see stitching in the pictures (black thread).To protect these from moisture, I used some Melatonin shoe waterproofing spray I had. Worked great at sealing them.The color in the picture is accurate. It is a dark charcoal gray (black).Amazon's price was by far the best I could find on the net.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,WOW, does a great job even on filthy cars. I'm amazed!!,First a couple advantages for waterless car washes.1) No water dripping from trunk, mirrors front grill etc causing spotting.2) You can lower your windows immediately without water streaking the outside of the window.3) You can do half your car take a break and finish it later or another day.4) Save a lot of money on brush-less car washes and no waiting in line. ($20 to $30 in my area)The towels are amazing. They are thick and plush and 15" square. I only needed 2 to do my mid size 4 door car including wheels and tires.My 1st use: My car was dirty from driving in the rain and wet roads for a week. The dirt and grime effortlessly wiped right off and then buffed up shiny (with 2nd towel). This cleaner seems to have a light wax in it. My paint finish was glossy and slippery when dry. It took me an hour to do a filthy mid sized car. I used less than 1/8 of the 35oz bottle. I'm sure I'll need lot less next time when my car is not so filthy...I even detailed the engine compartment with the damp cleaning towel without needing more spray. Looked really good after 20 minutes work.One WARNING: Hand wash the dirty application towel(s) before putting them in the washing machine. You'll be shocked how much dirt is in the towel(s). Even if you wash them by themselves in the washer, they'll surely leave a dirty ring in the wash tube and then you'll have to clean the inside of the washing machine. Not to mention your wife will be upset if you're married. :)Be sure to read the simple instructions on the bottle label......1st time using it was easy. No tricks needed or learning curve to get it right. Leaves a shiny lightly waxed shine. Don't worry about using this on an expensive car. Mine is a 2011 Infinity that looks like new. You will notice some light hazing in a few places that looks like wax not completely buffed. Just buff it with the towel. It comes off easily.Thank you to all the other reviewers who's reviews convinced me this product was worth a try,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,December 7, 2012,B003V3RVWI,Griot's Garage 11285 Spray-On Car Wash Kit,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V3RVWI,Griot's Garage,$29.99

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Automatic charging-Simple to use, Quiet,I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good modernd battery charger should do.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE (11-27-12). Gold box special was $25.25 + tax. (I would likely buy it at the regular price for $31.65)It's basically semi-automatic. You do have to set the current otherwise it will default to 2A. When I 1st used the charger the voltage defaulted to 12V. There is a button to select 6V or 12V. You won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently (I tried it intentionally). Compact size and reasonable quality clamps (not brass or brass plated though).It does not come with quick disconnect charge connector or maintainer cable to permanently install on your battery.Quiet: Mine has no humming or buzzing as another has noted. It does have a small fan that does not turn off, but you can barely hear it..This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge batteries big and small and top off or maintain batteries as needed.This works well as an maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. After charge is complete the current shuts off and charger goes into maintenance mode where it monitors battery voltage and starts charging again when the battery drops below a preset level. (should be about 12.75V)I did check the charger current and shutoff for maintenance mode. (See detail below)The charger is relatively small, light weight and feels feels reasonably well built with medium weight plastic. The charger has a small cooling fan and does not get warm after charging at 6A. The battery clamps are not great but good enough.LED indicators: I really like the charge status lEDs for 25% 50%, 75% and 100% (or Charged)I gave this charger 4.5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is decent as well.Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge or 25% discharge.(Typical full charge is 12.7V to 12.75V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal to measure charging current.I set the charge current to 6A1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 4.2A. Charger indicated 25% charge2) After 30min the charge current was 3.61A. Charge voltage is 13.19V. Charger indicated 25% charge3) After 1 hour the charge current is 3.61A. Charge voltage is 13.38V. Charger indicated 25% charge4) After 1.5 hours the charge current is 2.84A. Charge voltage is 13.60V. Charger indicated 50% charge5) After 2 hours the charge current is 2.47A. Charge voltage is 13.95V. Charger indicated 50% chargeNote: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 2.5 hours the charge current is 1.74A. Charge voltage is 14.63V. Charger indicated 75% charge7) After 3 hours the charge current is 0.33A. Charge voltage is 14.79V. Charger indicated 75% charge8) After 3.5 hours the charge current is 0.22A. Charge voltage is 14.80V. Charger indicated 75% charge9) After 3.75 hours the charge current is 0.0A. Charge voltage is 13.57V. Charger indicated 100% chargeCharger is now in the monitor mode/maintenance. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 7.5W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Note that the charger did not charge at the set current of 6A. Apparently the battery was not low enough for a 6A charge rate.(My opinion) This charger did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current AUTOMATICALLY declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.Note 12-17-12: I just found out a friend of mine has been using this exact model for a few years to maintain his motorcycle batteries. He's happy with it.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great value, simple design,Truthfully I don't understand some of the negative reviews.a) These lights are cheap enough where if you lose or break it, you won't be upset.b) I have 3 of these now. I have no problems with the magnets falling off. If they do, I will glue back on.c) I keep a few of these in my car for emergency lighting, and one in the house.d) There are more expensive work/emergency lights with more features but they cost a lot more.e) This light is relatively small so it is easy to store and will fit in your pocket, but not for EDC.f) Light output is acceptable but not really bright. They use low cost LED's. But again you don't need the expensive state of the art LED's that you find in expensive flashlights.g) To replace the batteries you do need to remove 3 Philips screws. A pain if you are in a hurry but it does make the battery cover secure.Overall quality for the price is very good in my opinion.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Preventative maintenance,No mileage improvement on new car.I bought this for PM and really didn't expect and increase in mileage. Based on all the reviews I believe this will keep my new car running like new for a long time.My car has two MPG meters built in. I started using this additive after break-in at 6,000 miles. I drive the same route to work everyday. I did not have any measurable change in mileage... Not surprised since the car is new.The engine is definitly quieter in the morning when 1st started (cold start). (I start the motor in the garage with my window open, so all the engine sounds are amplified)I will continue to use this additive to prevent fuel system problems and offset the negative effects of methanol...Usage: Label instructions are "2-3oz per 10gals". Having a new car I use 2oz per 10gal, or 1oz per 5gal every time I buy gas. I took one of my wife's 1/4 cup measuring cups which is 2oz. I add the treatment when I get home. Keeps it simple.Amazon's price changes between 20 and 26. Get the best price by putting it in your cart and save it for later.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Makes LCP useful at longer distances,Easy to install and zero in. Once installed use the iron sites to zero in the laser. Best to do this at about 10yards. This reduces the error from the laser being lower than the muzzle. Mine needed considerable adjustment. No problem easy to do.The LCP is a difficult for me to shoot beyond 7 yards since it has a long trigger pull, is so small, as well as poor iron sites. The trigger guard also bangs up my finger when fired. With the laser, I can shoot much more accurately at 10 yards or more.This laser fits the gun perfectly. I wouldn't put this in my back pocket and sit on it anymore. (with the laser) The laser is well built and is simply constructed. The activation button works well, but there is no off switch, so the laser will turn on when handling/cleaning the gun.Excellent upgrade for this pistol. Once you decide to keep the laser get a spare battery at Amazon. Good price on a strange size battery.If you need a more/better grip on your LCP check Hogue slip on rubber grips Jr. (Helped me a lot.)Note:Ships from and sold by Amazon.com,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 4, 2012,B0044SP4ZU,Crimson Trace Ruger LCP Laserguard and Free Grovtec Pocket Holster,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044SP4ZU,Crimson Trace,$173.99

My TV is internet ready and has Netflix but drops the connection often.My Current use is for streaming Netflix wirelessly.I always get HD when available. Overall picture quality is very good. Never drops the wireless connection. Menu for Netflix is very good.I bought this one because the reviews were generally good (including the remote) and the capability to play movies from networked drives which I may need in the future.The only problem I've had on 2 units is they occasionaly freeze/lockup. Removing power for a few seconds always fixes the problem. This forces a complete reboot. Power on/off does not competely reboot the system.Firmware updates can be done wireless from the settings menu.Cable TV programming in Houston, TX is very poor and expensive for what you get.

Stitching quality is good.c) Flat designWhen I received this cardholder, I was pleasantly surprised with quality and good looks.If I had seen this in person, I would have expected it to cost $20 or more.I would absolutely recommend this to a friend and I would not hesitate to buy this again.Sold by: TNT Deals Inc, paid 7.99,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,June 10, 2012,B001PMG7UE,Rolodex Low-Profile Business Card Book, 96-Card, Black (76659),Office Products,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMG7UE,none,$9.60
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great vest but SIZE runs a bit small,As other reviewer have said and I agree "the quality is reasonably good for the price".I bought this safety vest primarily for roadside emergencies. The area I live in does not have shoulders to pull over should I get a flat or other mechanical problem..a)Made of a lightweight synthetic mesh with decent quality nylon zipper. (Left hand zip takes some getting used to.)b)Highly reflective/visible day or night. Very bright yellow/green. Seems to glow in daylight.b)Size: I normally wear medium. Medium in this vest fits my SLIM frame well with a T-shirt on.d)get a larger size for winter, so it fits over your winter jacket.e)The medium is probably good for most ladies with or without a jacket. The medium I bought will be for my wife and the new large I have just ordered will be for me.Note sure how these would hold up with everyday use in a work environment. See other reviews.Happy with the purchase-I feel I paid a reasonably good price for the quality.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,June 12, 2012,B003VKWQBC,Neiko® 53940A Safety Vest Front Zipper, High Visibility Neon Yellow | ANSI/SEA Standard - Size M,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKWQBC,Ridgerock Tools Inc.,$7.41
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Helped me get through a very difficult time in my life last year (2012),I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE WRITING A REVIEW FOR FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTS.I started taking these in JUNE 2012 while going through a divorce and an expensive, stressful custody battle for my son (I am the father).Somewhere I read that fish oil supplements can help with excessive stress, anxiety, fatigue etc.These fish oil caps helped me keep a clear head while not getting enough sleep for MANY MONTHS. I was amazed how effective this product was FOR ME. With the help of a great lawyer and this product my custody battle results turned out very well.When my wife was pregnant her doctor recommended taking fish oil supplements. Well my boy is 5 years old now. He is very healthy and smart. So, the medical community believes there is something to be gained for the growing fetus.Fish taste: Some if you don't take these at the beginning or halfway through a meal. I actually am glad there is a fish taste, because that means the fish oil is unlikely to be over-processed.Fish Burps: Yes, sometimes. None if you take them at the beginning of a meal and/or empty stomach.Large capsule: True, but they slide down my throat without water. Very easy to swallow.I continue to take these daily and always keep extra stock on hand.Price is good: at the recommended 2 per day the 120 count bottle will last 2 months at $22-$25 per bottle. (I save more now: 20% with subscribe and save and 5 items per month)I am an experienced electronic engineer and believe in what works. Vitamins and supplements are one of those things that sound like a good idea but often lack positive measurable results. These caps helped me a lot and I will continue to take them indefinitely.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,January 22, 2013,B002FU6I9K,New Chapter Wholemega, Whole Fish Oil with Omegas and Vitamin D3 - 120 ct,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FU6I9K,New Chapter,$29.89

The metal zipper used to stick but I found small black threads where it was stcking. After removing the threads no more sticking.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Good lightweight jacket at the right price,I bought the dark spruce 1st and and then the navy. Both colors are very good (not overly dark etc).This jacket has a light weight outer shell and light/med weight SOFT flannel lining. The flannel lining makes it a little difficult to get your arms through if you're wearing a longsleave knit shirt.The outer shell is water resistant, not a shiny synthetic. The overall design is simple. No extra pockets inside because it is reversible.The material quality is good, construction quality and detail is good. The elastic cuffs do not seal your wrists though.Overall a nice jacket and very comfortable to wear.I don't believe this jacket is worth the suggested retail of $128, but is reasonable at $50 to $60.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 12, 2012,B005LB6SUE,Nautica Men's Windward Reversible Jacket, Dark Spruce, Medium,Clothing,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB6SUE,none,none
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Best wool sock I've tried.,I recently discovered that cotton socks are not the best choice for sweaty feet or odor resistance.I've tried at least 4 brands of Merino wool socks sold here on Amazon and these are by far the best.a) They don't slip down my ankle.b) Minimal pilling.c) They keep their shape.d) The don't fade.e) If you have smelly feet from wearing shoes all day the dirty socks will not stink up your closet or clothes hamper.One helpful tip I got from reading the reviews. Wash them turned inside out in a lingerie bag. Dry normally. This works well.I love 'em.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Handsome watch-very comforable to wear,I received the watch 1 week ago: Amazon's packaging was very professional. The Tag box is as handsome as the watch. Everything included was high quality.The watch is exactly what I wanted and is described well in pictures and features table..The watch is relatively thin at 10mm compared to other watches with more features that are 13mm to 15mm thick. The diameter at 39mm is a good fit for most wrists as it does not appear large or oversized in any way.Rubber wrist band is very good quality. Forms readily to my wrist. The band does require trimming to your size. There are no instructions in the manual, but it is not difficult to figure out.Sapphire crystal is very hard. Very difficult to scratch. According to Wikipedia the only thing that can scratch it is a diamond.The watch does have some weight to it, but the rubber band distributes the weight well. As I move my arm during the day, the watch stays upright at the top of my wrist even though I still have the band a little loose.Trimming the band: you have to cut the band to size. The backside of the band has grooves. The spacing of the grooves are relatively small and you should cut along a groove. Be careful when you get close to your size because one grove makes a surprising difference. The upside is the watch band will fit perfectly.The overall look of the watch is very handsome. I does not look flashy at all.Beautifully crafted watch at a very good price. Would not hesitate to buy it or another expensive watch from Amazon again.Note:Ships from and sold by Amazon.com6 week update: The watch is very accurate. It has kept time to 1 second compared with 2 radio updated clocks. It has become even more comfortable as the rubber wrist band forms to your wrist(takes only a few days). At 6weeks now, the longer I have this watch the more I like it. It is very high quality, excellent workmanship. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. ha ha9 month update 11-25-12 watch keeps time perfectly.

Soft, Great looking and very comfortable- GREAT PRICE,Good quality fabric is soft and stretches a little for excellent comfort.Workmanship is good, but not the best.Fit is very good-true to size for me. Standard medium.Sleeves are loose and will easily fit you guys with thick arms.Length is good, if you don't want to tuck it in.Great color if you like grey.Comes out of the dryer wrinkle free.The buttons are for show. There are no button holes or stitching for button holes.Love the shirt! Very happy with this one. It is already one of my top favorites. Wish they had more colors. Well worth the current price of $20.Value, style, quality for the price=5 starsUpdate 4-12-12, I like this shirt so much, I decided to get an another on for backup.Update 4-16-12 I washed the 1st shirt for the 2nd time and threads needed trimming at the neckline where the buttons are.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great Value, Good simple design,I like this brand surge protector. It's design is simple and does not standout.For the negative reviews about the 2' cord: It is clear in the description it is a 2 footer. Amazon also sells a 4' version. I have 2 of those as well.The 2' cord is perfect when you need more than two outlets or you have a power supply that block 2 outlets. No extra cord to hide on this 2 footer.Simply design made of quality plastic. I have found nothing cheap about these yet.I like the UNLIGHTED switch on the end hidden from view. (see customer photo) Personally I did not want a lighted switch.The price on Amazon is less than Walmart's lowest price units and looks better.I have four of these now and like them and love the price.

Safe 45%, lockdown 45%, Pelican ammo box (sealed) 37% lockdown 35% and then ambient (room) 65% lockdown 65%.My research on measuring relative humuidity revealed expensive calibrated hygrometers ($50 to $120) are usually accurate (spec'd) to +/-2% to +/-6%. The lockdown also gets close to the actual humidity within 5 minutes or less..It is made of all plastic. Comes with velcro fastener with double sticky tape. Very handy.Small enough to put in anything you want to monitor humudity.I will be ordering a few more for my other dry boxes.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 24, 2012,B004RQWLAA,Lockdown Vault Hygrometer,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RQWLAA,Lockdown,$8.97

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great lamp! good white light output and 3 brightness levels,Summary first:I received the gray. An excellent color with aluminum accents. I think it looks better in person than in the pictures.The base is plastic with metal inside and heavy enough for stability. The lamp is made of good quality plastic and some metal. Overall solid quality construction. The LED's are recessed in the thin lamp arm section so they don't shine in your eyes. The diffuser works well and evenly lights work area with no glare. Power consumption is very low at 8.4W on max brightness. The lamp is just barely warm after hours of use. Lamp control is by touch button similar to a touch screen on a smartphone. Touch button is lighted when off. There is no separate on/off button.I love this lamp and would not hesitate to buy it again. The longer I have it the more I like it.Light output: Max 500 lumen. For comparison 400 Lumens= 40W incandescent and 800 Lumens= 60W incandescent. Keep in mind that this lamps light is reflected down so it will appear to put out more light.Dimming: 3 levels. No separate on/off, so you have to cycle down from high, med, low to off. No big deal for me. Touch control works well similar to a smart phone touch screen.Light color: Halfway between warm white and bright white on the color spectrum. A good choice in my opinion. Not too white like office fluorescent lighting.Light diffuser: Works well. You can easily see the individual LED's looking directly at them, but the lamp diffuser evenly lights your desk or work area. The LED lamp arm swivels about 15 degrees.Adjustability of lamp:1) BASE swivels only 45 degrees left or right. 90 degrees or more would be much better, but not a deal breaker for me.2) VERTICAL arm adjusts nearly flat front or back. (almost 90 degrees forward and almost 90 degrees backwards.3) LAMP ARM will fold down flush with the vertical arm and 45 degrees higher than horizontal. Sorry if that description is confusing.4) LAMP ARM TILT is only about 15 degrees. This is enough tilt to keep the lamp from shining in your eyes.Note: The lamp joint(s) do creek a little when brand new. This does not last long.LED life:You should NEVER have to replace any of the LED's. They are made of silicon. The same stuff as your computer microprocessors are made from (Intel) though the manufacturing process is much different. The built in power supply is much more likely to fail before any of the LED's.Note: Not this model, but some models from this company have an AC adapter (110V-220V) that can be replaced if it goes bad. Prism TLC-4300BK Multi-Function LED Desk Lamp with Anti-Glaring Filter , BlackPower consumption:OFF: 0 WattsHigh 8.4 WattsMed 4.4 Wattslow 2.5 WattsMeasured using Belkin Conserve Insight Energy-Use MonitorSwitched outlet: The lamp does not remember the last setting if used on switched outlet.Emergency Lighting: Since this lamp uses so little power it can be used as emergency lighting if you have some type of emergency power source either generator or battery with 12 DC to AC 110V.LED lighting costs have come down a lot but are still expensive. Still a good value at less than $100 considering the LED's will last a very long time, good light color, 3 light levels and excellent construction, materials and very low power consumption.I also have the Prism TLC-4300BK (more expensive) that has 3 light color option and a few extra features. I always use it on the white color. Great lamp to, if you don't mind the extra cost.If this review was helpful to you, please click "yes".

I'm a perfect Medium and this jacket is true to size. Fits perfectly.Shell is a medium weight SOFT denim. Inside lining is the old style Levi faux fur (blk in the blk jacket). Very nice. Sleeves are lined with a smooth synthetic. Easy to slip your arms in.Just minutes after putting it on I was feeling warmer. Should be a great jacket for the coolest days here in SE Texas. There is enough room to wear a medium weight sweater if needed.Inside one extra pocket on left side large enough for a wallet, pack of cigarettes etc. No closure for this pocket.Zipper and button closure. Great option. The zipper is light duty and appears to be only average quality. The zipper is brass painted black. I'll probably be using the buttons most often anyway.For those interested: the sleeves or waist don't seal well for cold cold weather.True the description is incorrect: should be outershell 100% cotton.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Charges small batteries or top off and maintain auto batteries,I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,December 1, 2012,B0009IBJAS,Schumacher SEM-1562A-CA 1.5 Amp Speed Charge Battery Maintainer,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IBJAS,Schumacher,$24.19

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Tough, Thick>Traps dust well>Hepa filter lasts longer,I bought this to use as a pre-filter for 3 Winix Hepa air purifier(2ea WAC5300 and 1ea WAC5500. Winix PlasmaWave 5300 Air Cleaner Model, Winix WAC5500 True HEPA Air Cleaner with PlasmaWave TechnologyI have had this pre-filter for about 2 months now:I bought one first to check the quality and thickness and durability.These are thick enough so you can't see light through them and it seems to trap about 95% of the visible dust which keeps the carbon pre-filter clean much longer.I use a vacuum cleaner to clean the dust off this filter which works very well. My vacuum has strong suction and really pulls hard and stretches this filter. The filter takes this punishment very well and doesn't lose it's shape.I have since bought 2 more for my two other two air purifiers. This pre-filter should extend the life of the expensive Hepa filter which cost $65+.Very happy with this product.All the positive reviews were right on - Thanks.[...] Thanks,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 20, 2013,B002GKC2US,Duck Brand 1285234 Replacement Air Conditioner Foam Filter, 24-Inch by 15-Inch by 1/4-Inch, 1-Pack,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GKC2US,Duck,$3.97
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,This drive can FLY,My system basics:Windows 7, 64bitDell Vostro 3550 about 6 months old.Intel Core I5 (quad) 2.3ghz with turbo.8GB dramSata 3 drive controllerCrucial M4 128GB SSD, Read 500MB/sec, write speed 200MB/sec (was originally WD 7200rpm 320GB)My qualifications: Electronic Engineer/Project manager. PC owner for 25+ years.Opening comments: I have owned pc's for 25years. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK UPGRADE YOU COULD EVER HOPE TO BUY!!!! IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN REPLACING A 2YR OLD COMPUTER OR LAPTOP AND OF COURSE CHEAPER!! Other benefits: windows is more stable. If you have a lot of programs open at the same time, the computer remains stable all day. Now, I rarely need to reboot.I bought a Crucial M4 SSD (solid state drive) about a 2 month's ago and was amazed at the speed. Can't go back to mechanical hard-drives. I bought this one because it was spec'd faster than the M4 and I needed a back-up drive. This technology does not have a reliability track record for long term use as a computer drive. Once a week, I create clone drive copy as a back up. If the drive fails this clone can be popped in my laptop and I'm ready to go in 10 minutes. No restore needed except the few files I have added or changed.Summary 1st: Both drives are excellent choices. (Sandisk Extreme and Crucial M4)On my laptop, in every day use Sandisk extreme is slightly faster.See posted photo's for actual data.a)According to "ASS SD" benchmark test. Crucial is much faster than this drive (Sandisk Extreme.)b)According to "Benchmark" speed test: Sandisk Extreme is faster. SanDisk write speed blows away the Crucial M4.Note: Electrical specs like statistics can be presented in a way that is deceptive.Spec from SanDisk website for the Extreme (not in Amazon's description)Performance 120GBSequential Read (up to) 550 MB/s 550 MB/s 540 MB/sSequential Write (up to) 510 MB/s 520 MB/s 460 MB/sI like this drive a lot. Great performance!! Definitely would recommend it to a friend.I will update this review if there are any reliability problems.Hope this helps you make an informed decision on what to buy.Thanks to all those who have posted reviews on Amazon. They have been extremely helpful in making good purchase decisions on Amazon.7-22-12 3month update: Drive has been performing flawlessly. No problems or issues.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great little watch, My son loves it.,This watch is for my 5yr old son.Watch face size is just about right to just a little big for his age. The nylon/Velcro band is great for the little ones, so they can put it on by themselves. He now can start to learn to tell time. (I hope)The band is long, so I trimmed it to his size.The watch face is bright and bezel metal is chrome plated. Excellent finishThe black bezel numbers are recessed so they won't wear off and as you can see from the pictures easy to read.This is a real watch. Tells time. Accuracy: I don't know yet.The graphics on the face are good, but the numbers on the face are small and difficult to read. But the bezel numbers are perfect for telling time.Overall a quality piece for a child.As another review pointed out, this may not be a good choice for older children.Great buy on sale. ~$20Ships from and sold by Amazon.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,April 7, 2012,B0045214MC,Marvel Kid's MA0103-D2785-BlueVelcro Marvel Spider-Man Classic Time Teacher Watch,Watches,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045214MC,none,none
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,GREAT LOOKING, Top quality, Soft fabric, Great Fit,I bought one of these on a Gold Box special (Dec 2012). After I received it and wore it for a day, I ordered 2 more in different colors.Quality: Excellent. Very well made.Material: Excellent quality. Soft and flexible. Comes out of the dryer absolutely wrinkle free. The material weight is light to medium.Fit: Great. I am a normally (slender) medium. This sweater is a perfect fit.Colors: The 3 colors I received match Amazon's pictures accurately. (Nice surprise)Style: I love henleys and this is the best looking one I have.Note: Amazons's photo should show the neck unbuttoned. The upper neck portion of the sweater easily folds down to form a collar. Looks great this way.Also not zippered-buttons like the picture.Buy one for your boyfriend, husband or yourself.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,VERY DURABLE labels, great label maker,About the Labels:We've used Brother labels at my work for many years. I have an electronic meter with a brother label on it that has lasted for 15years+ and still firmly attached to it. The printing is also clear like new.We use these to label prototype circuit boards. The labels withstand repeated alcohol and acetone cleaning baths. The labels never come off. The printing and surface of the labels appear new after years of use.The label tape is an OUTSTANDING product.This label maker has more features than I'll ever use and it is easier to use than the older models. Love the backlit LCD display to.Even with all the features this thing has, it is still easy to use if you don't want to read the manual. Usually more features = more difficult to use and keep the manual.I bought this label maker because the labels are great. I like the extra features for potential future uses especially the pc connectable option.Comes with 1" width label starter cartridge. Too big for most uses. You will need to buy the smaller width ie 1/2" at some point.Note: shipped from and sold by Amazon ~$55,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 12, 2012,B0047T7JMW,Brother PC Connectable Labeling System (PT2730),Office Products,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047T7JMW,Brother Printer,$99.99

Great fit for slender and/or athletic build.Comes out of the dryer mostly wrinkle free. Some may want to touch it up with an iron.Shirt is smaller than normal for its size.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Good value, Simple (no gimmicks) 400W and 800W settings,I bought one of these at the beginning of the winter 2012 (26.9). Now 5 months later the heater still works perfectly and I have ordered another one at a end of season discount (19.99).I like this heater because:a) It is simple. No thermostat, timer, fan etc (Simple = more reliable) If you need a thermostat, you can buy one that plugs into your wall outlet.b) I know EXACTLY how much electricity it is using.c) Simple clean looking.d) Reasonable pricee) VERY QUIET(Note: if you use it in a bedroom, it does put out a fair amount of light.)f) Saves money - I have electric central heat (very expensive compared to natural gas).This heater paid for itself the 1st month.NEW HEATER WILL:a) Make creaking noise when it heats up. This stops after a few weeks of use.b) Plastic smell: the sides of the heater are plastic and smell the 1st few times the heater is used. The smell stops after a few uses.I have read many reviews that complain it won't heat a room etc.This is not the heater's fault.You need to understand how much heat (watts) you need based on room size, outside temperature and how well insulated your room/apt/house is.If you find this heater will not heat up your room enough on those really cold days, get a another one. I did. I think 2 small heaters placed strategically in a room is much better than one big one.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,March 9, 2013,B000GG8DWA,none,none,none,none,none
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,1,Keeps my home dry and comfortable-WAS A RELIABLE MACHINE Stopped working,Update: After 1.5 years use this dehumidifier gradually stopped removing humidity. I would not buy one again without a good extended warranty. The negative reviews about poor longevity are correct.I've had this dehumidifier for almost one year now and am happy to report it has done a great job for me with no issues..I read dozens of reviews for this and other models and settled on this one as the probably the one of the best available on Amazon. It was a tough decision. Now one year later I know it was a good decision. Thanks to all the honest reviews.I do not use the drain feature, so I will not be able to address that.I live near the Gulf coast so, I get a lot of humidity all year. Evenings are the worst where the average is 80%-100%1) NOISE: Not quiet but not loud either. I can barely hear the compressor from 10ft away. The noise you hear is air being pumped through the unit. All brands, models have to move air to remove the humidity. No way around that.2) HYGROMETER (humidity gauge)is accurate. I have a calibrated and certified hygrometer 10ft away from the unit and they both get the same readings. (note: I paid almost $60 for the hygrometer)3) POWER OUTAGE: It remembers all the settings after power has been disconnected. So no need to be concerned if left unattended. Also this means you can use a timer to turn the unit on several times a day and save electricity and reduce noise in your living area.4) Holds a lot of water. I only need to empty the tank once a week maximum. It's not hard to do as some reviewers have complained although water by nature is heavy.5) SAVES POWER IN THE SUMMER. The unit does increase my living room temperature about 2 degrees F in the summer, but we are much more comfortable at a higher temperature by reducing humidity and therefore have increased the temp on our AC thermostat.6) The control panel is simple and easy to operate. There is an easy to read lighted digital display.ELECTRIC USAGE: BARELY NOTICED AN INCREASE IN MY BILL!!One of my major concerns was how much a dehumidifier will raise my ELECTRIC BILL: I also wondered why does this thing need to be on 24/7 as other reviewers reported using it.IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ON 24/7:I bought a good quality 3 prong mechanical timer and set it to turn on 30min every 4 hours. I set the dehumidifier for 45% (The 30min on time is now at 45min since we've had humidity at or near 100% for about a week now. And yes you can have 100% humidity when it is not raining :)My target average humidity is 50%. For me 30 mins on every 4 hours kept my 750sq/ft apt within the 45% to 50%. Even in the bedroom although slightly higher. Of course you can adjust your &#34;on&#34; time if you need to.CONTROLLING NOISE: Using a on/off timer greatly reduces the noise. 30 minutes on every four hours is very tolerable. I hardly notice it now.INCREASING USEFUL LIFE: A major additional benefit of using a timer is that the unit is on 3 hours a day total. This method keeps the motor and compressor from getting overworked and hot which increases wear and tear. Also based on negative reviews this and many other dehumidifiers often don't last more than a year these days when used 24/7.TIMER: This one is almost identical to the one I'm using. It has two 3 prong outlets and can be set in 15min increments while most other timers are 30min increments. Stanley 38448 TimeIt Duo Two-Outlet 24 Hour Indoor Mechanical Timer, WhiteVery happy with this product. I paid $219 a year ago.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,75c per 15gal VERY CHEAP TREATMENT / INSURANCE,Hope to keep my new car running like new for a long time.I have read most of the reviews about sick engines getting better mileage and running much better after using this product.Most of us (including myself) wait until there is a problem then try to fix it and that can get very expensive. IF possible, I prefer to prevent the problem and save the extra expense and inconvenience.This additive should keep my fuel system clean and in new or near new condition maximizing mileage and performance while I own the car. Even if I get "bad gas", I probably won't notice it.My car is protected against the negative effects of methanol. Water, phase separation, varnish build-up. The injectors will STAY clean.I can't recommend this product because of personal experience because I have no engine problems nor an increase in mileage.COST: At the recommended 1oz per 15 gallons it is a inexpensive treatment. $25/32oz = $0.78 for 15gals. At 500gal per bottle X 25mpg, this 32oz bottle will last 12,500 miles.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 21, 2012,B002E9A6PO,Star brite Star Tron Gasoline Additive,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E9A6PO,Star brite,$8.00
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Good compromise: quality vs price. Good enough selection for most jobs.,I would have never bought or looked for a set like this because most sets are missing too many sizes to be useful.I saw this in the gold box special and was surprised at the assortment at a reasonable price.QUALITY: Not the best and not the lowest quality. I feel this set is a reasonable comprise of quality vs price.This set is fairly complete for most jobs around the house or car. It doesn't have it all, but comes close. Surprisingly good set of bits including torx and hex bits.See my photos.CONVENIENT: The reason I bought this.I already have a good collection of higher quality tools, but many jobs I do require a few extra trips to the tool box because I got the wrong size or forgot something.**This is my go to first tool set now for around the house repairs. This set is good enough to do most car repairs and would be great to keep in the trunk.CASE:Reasonably good but does have potential issues other reviewers mentioned. Case is made of blow molded plastic which is bound to have some problems with regular use. (Blow molded plastic is soft and often thin) All my tools stay in their slots so far. Latches are molded into the case and will eventually break with use. I do expect this case to last a long time with reasonable care. Case looks good to.Again a reasonable compromise of quality vs price.WEIGHT: The set is heavy at 18 pounds, but that is expected with so many tools.See my close up photo's of each section.This set won't let you do everything, but will come close. One reviewer said all you will need to add is a hammer and drill. And another comment: 90% of the tools 90% of the time. Great comments and I agree with both.Very happy with this set. Now I have one set I can grab for my do it yourself jobs and only occasionally go to my tool box(S) for the odd size or specialty tool.If this review was helpful to you, please click "yes".

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Natural light tan, Works great on my FACE,It's winter now and my skin tone is pinkish white. Looks unhealthy until I started using this product a month ago.I use it on my face only and I am getting a natural light tan using it every other day at night before going to bed.Absorbs into my skin in less than 10 minutes.Because it is a gradual change it is very forgiving of mistake like missing a small area. Don't have to be careful about washing hands after use. I just rinse with water.I have had no skin problems using this product. My face is normally sensitive to almost all creams and lotions. But no problems with this one.. It actually has been very good as a moisturizer for me.I will be ordering medium in the spring.I like this product and am very happy with it. Should any adverse reactions happen after using it longer term, I will update this review.If you want to know what your skin tone looks like in the daylight get daylight light bulbs for your bathroom.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Amazing Results for me and my son,**11 month update** 4-19-15:I have been giving my 7yo son this since May of 2014 (1/3 scoop).. He has not been sick since (now Apr 2015, 11 months).. The previous school year my son was absent 17 sick days. I am ecstatic that I found something to help him. Helps me to. I haven't been sick either.I bought this on Ebay and saved about $5.I have tried many multivitamins over the years and have never noticed any changes. I took them as insurance.When I heard about this one, I thought it was too good to be true. I researched Dr Wallach's youtube videos and reviews here on Amazon and decided to give it a try.My results are amazingly great!About me:61 year old male. 155lbs Not overweight. Gradual declining mental clarity, declining energy/ increasing fatigue over the years. I am in good health with normal blood pressure. But I just don't feel good as I used to when I was younger.Results:a) I started with 2 scoops per day and had to cut back to 1 scoop. (Note: 1 month later I am still at 1 scoop per day with great results.)b) By the 4th day my energy levels noticeably increased.c) After 2 weeks, I was absolutely sure this was working for me. My energy levels are great and still improving, mental clarity and focus dramatically improved. I am sleeping better than I have for many years. I wake up refreshed and do not get tired in the afternoon.d) Now after one month: These improvements are still increasing but at a slower rate.e) My muscles don't ache and are not stiff the day after a hard workout.f) Lifelong problem with constipation is gone (for now).This all seems to good to be true....I suspect I am a victim of inadequate micronutrients or trace minerals which standard good quality vitamins do not have.This is stuff is expensive, but if it works for you it is well worth the price. I suggest you watch Dr Wallach's youtube videos esp &#34;Best of Dead Doctors Don't Lie&#34;.**3 month update:I continue to take only 1 scoop per day.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great value, refreshes and sanitizes any room,I have used ozone industrial machines like this for many years to clean the air in my house or apt.Most of you may have read that your house or apt is polluted from chemicals emanating from paint, furniture, carpet etc.Ozone:a) Kills bacteria, viruses, mold spores etc.b) Destroys (oxidizes) ALL odors, not just cover up the smellc) Destroys (oxidizes) all chemical fumes from paint to formaldehyde that pollute your house.About the unit:a) comes with 3 plates. This unit puts out enough ozone with one plate installed. I save the other 2 plates for replacements. I use this in a 700sq ft apt.b) The plates deteriorate with use because nitric acid forms on the plates in a humid environment. The plates can be cleaned but the acid will still eat away at the metal grid on the plates. So, the extra 2 plates you have can extend the life of the unit. You can also buy replacement plates on Amazon.c) I never need to turn this on for more than 20 minutes. Note: It has a 60 min timer with a hold function.About ozone: Ozone is oxygen that has been converted from naturally occurring 02 into 03.03 is highly reactive. 03 (ozone) recombines into 02 in a relatively short time.a) Ozone is a powerful oxidizer. It kills bacteria, viruses etc by eating away the outer shell. Once the outer shell is damaged the bacteria/virus dies. UV kills bacteria and viruses by damaging the DNA. Not as effective as ozone.b) Ozone is not healthy to breath, so set your timer when everyone will be out of the house for more than an hour.C) You can sanitize your central air and heating system by turning on the fan only while the ozone machine is on.Ozone vs Electrostatic air cleaners.a) Electrostatic air cleaners do produce a small amount of ozone that does freshen the air, but their main purpose is to remove particles from the air. I have owned several and they are difficult to clean and become unusable after about a years use.b) Ozone produced in higher concentrations will kill or neutralize pollen, bacteria, viruses, mold spores and odors from any source. Note: if the source of odors is not removed the odors will come back. (cat box, rotting trash etc)I know this is a lot more info than most of you want or need to know.Summary: Ozone and machines like this are the most effective way to clean and sanitize the air in your house. It will not damage the finish on any of your possessions.Update and Reminder: OZONE IS A POWERFUL OXIDIZER. Ozone is not healthy AND VERY DANGEROUS TO BREATH AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS and UNHEALTHY TO BREATH AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. So set your timer when everyone will be out of the house for at least one hour or more.Paid $145 May 2012. Sold by Homeland Goods Fulfilled by Amazon.Jan 2013 (6 months) still working perfectly.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Works great for older skin...,A friend at work was taking these for skin, hair and nails. I wrote down the name and checked the reviews here and Amazon. I was surprised to find so many positive reviews.I'm a 61 yo healthy man with no medical issues. I don't have many wrinkles but have had a problem with itchy skin on my face only that even wakes me up at night. My complexion is a bit on the pink side too.In less than a week my skin has noticeably improved. The itching greatly improved and my skin color was improving.Now 6 weeks later, the itching is completely gone. Skin color is a healthy normal tone.Additionally, my facial skin was always sensitive and tended to be dry. My skin is no longer sensitive or dry. I rarely need a moisturizer anymore.I take 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening on an empty stomach as instructed.... The pills are large, but not a problem for me. Just wash them down with water.Because of the great results with this product, I also started taking 100mg of Hyaluronic acid everyday.

So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 8 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 12 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium. Protein 4 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 3 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.Crunchy: These are a messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!I have had these for about a month now and I have just ordered the variety pack and the cinnamon flavor pack from amazon.Enjoy, I do.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,April 21, 2012,B0032GMRBO,Nature Valley Dark Chocolate Granola Bar, 8.94 oz (Pack of 6),Grocery & Gourmet Food,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032GMRBO,Nature Valley,$30.00

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Fun, Durable and batteries last,Where to begin? Build quality is great. Materials quality is very good. Feels like good solid construction. My 4yr old son hasn't broken it. :-) Colors look realistic not cheap. Batteries last longer than expected. It has a power saver mode when someone forgets to turn it off. 1st set lasted 2 months with frequent use. It's an entertaining toy that makes realistic dino sounds. A bit loud at times if your watching TV. Some parents may not like it when you lift the tail and it farts and then laughs. I think it's funny. Kids make those sounds anyway so no harm. If the power has been left on, and it hears a sound the toy will wake up briefly make a Dino sound then go back to sleep if not played with. My son has had it 4 months now and is on to newer things. The Dino is cool looking and though not a favorite of his anymore, it looks good on the shelf. Love it, recommend it. Again good quality build, materials and coloration.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 4, 2012,B00383PNBW,Cruncher Prehistoric Pets Interactive Dinosaur,Toys & Games,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00383PNBW,Mattel,$55.95
Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Great boots for active kids,My boy loves to wear these boots and for us that's more than half the battle. :)These are well made of thick molded rubber like material. They are lined with thin cloth for reinforcement, and it makes it easier for him to put on. These are good quality boots.The tread is thick and aggressive and provides great traction. Haven't tested the traction on smooth wet surfaces yet.One reviewer lamented that the boots had deformed after leaving them in the sun for a while. Thanks for the info. I'll remember not to do that.I bought at least one size bigger. They fit well, but a little big (room to grow). No problem though. He has no problem walking/running in them.Worth $20, free S&H and no tax.Note: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,February 12, 2012,B0019ZP9SS,Kamik Stomp Rain Boot (Toddler/Little Kid/Big Kid),Navy/Black Sole,13 M US Little Kid,Shoes,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZP9SS,Kamik Kids Footwear,$29.95

Settled on these because they're easy to put on and the easy tear sides for removing them.My little boy only needs these at night, but sometimes he saturates them so they leak. Other brands do the same. Wish someone would make these larger sizes with extra capacity.My boy also likes these best as they are more comfortable for him. :)The easy tear sides make them easy to take off. We've had only 1 of hundreds start to come apart at the sides.Overall happy with the brand especially with amazon mom discout and free shipping.

Kent,A34ZS78ACD3D7Z,5,Well Built, many possible uses, flexible configurations,I have 3 maxpedition bags and this is my favorite.These bags are very well built with heavy duty materials and zippers. This bag will last a long time. Recommended cleaning with damp cloth only (easy).I have a black one that I used as a range bag for a while. It became too small for the task, when I starting bringing 3 handguns with ammo and ear protection.I use it now as a day carry bag. Front pocket is good for conceal carry with room for extra mags. Each of the 2 compartments is lined with velcro loop on each side so you can configure this anyway you want with Maxpedition hook and loop accessories (very handy).The loop lining (hook & loop=velcro) is also soft and helps cushion contents. I personally haven't added exterior molle attachments except a flashlight on the side. Amazon's price is the best. Check Maxpedition's website for better pictures and to check available add-ons and accessories.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,George Takei's early career, including Star Trek,4 1/2 starsAfter reading a review of his newer book, I decided to start with this one, as it's very inexpensive. I liked the early part of this book best,as it dealt with his childhood in the WWII camps that Japanese-Americans were cruelly imprisoned in for the duration of that war. His family life was strong and gave him a lot of strengths. He's clearly smart, as he did a couple of years of architecture at UC Berekeley before transferring to drama at UCLA. He started getting great character roles even before he graduated. With his father's advice, he invested in real estate, so that he never had to worry if the roles stopped coming. He's very kind about almost all of the actors he worked with except William Shatner.There's a lot more to Takei than just acting -- he was active in politics as well, right from the beginning, supporting candidates, running for office, and serving on an LA transportation board for years.There is NOTHING about Takei's romantic life in this book. I'm hoping there will be something in his recent one.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,April 5, 2014,0671890085,To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei, Star Trek's Mr. Sulu,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671890085,Pocket Books,$0.01
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Not as good as the first one...,It's good, a really good book, but it doesn't explain who Destiny is, and I really want to know. The first one was better because if felt more like a story, while this one felt more like words telling me things. But I'll probably still read the next one to see if it finally explains who Destiny is.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,June 22, 2014,0448462060,A Special Wish #2 (Magic Ponies),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0448462060,Grosset & Dunlap,$4.99
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,3,Not the best in this series,Perhaps because I'm not really that much of a WWII history buff, I found I wanted a lot more Maggie, and a lot less digression about the background to Pearl Harbor. All that meticulous research other readers mentioned neededto have been shoved into the background and be shown off a bit less. The story definitely suffered for all of it, and it was frustrating to not get to the actual event after all of that. But I definitely plan to read the next book, and hope for more of Maggie.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,June 19, 2014,0345536746,The Prime Minister's Secret Agent (Maggie Hope),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345536746,Bantam,$12.13

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Back to blonde!,My hair is every color from reddish brown through blonde, to bright white, with large white streaks at my temples. It's odd looking and aging. My hairdresser recommended this product and I used it twice a week. It's hard for me to manage to leave it in for five minutes, as I'm always in a rush, but I try. Gradually over the last few months the white has gotten less striking, and more blonde-seeming. It's not the best shampoo I've ever tried, as a cleaner, or nicely-scented, but it's definitely helping my hair color be a bit more homogeneous and less white.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,September 17, 2015,B001NFMM8E,Paul Mitchell Platinum Blonde Shampoo, 10.14 Ounce,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NFMM8E,PerfumeWorldWide, Inc.,$17.75

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Not a typical actor's bio...,Even though I enjoy most of the well-trained British actors I see on TV and in movies, Alan Cumming has always grabbed my attention whenever he's on screen. So I was eager to learn how and why he has so much power. This memoir is not at all atypical Hollywood ghostwritten book -- it's clearly a product of his anguish, and opens up his life and origins to a remarkableextent. He comes from a difficult background, mostly because of a cruel and abusive father. It's great that he escaped andhas turned his pain into art.I didn't find the book to be an easy or quick read, as it describes his relationship with his father, including a few scenes of abuse. His willingness to explore his family origins in public via a British TV show is remarkable, but perhaps he was looking for anotherpart of his family to focus on, to get past his father. Cumming is clearly a remarkable person and I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who enjoys him, and is tolerant of painful scenes of abuse. I'll look forward to reading any books he writes in the future.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,August 2, 2014,0062225065,Not My Father's Son: A Memoir,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062225065,Dey Street Books,$18.35

It's not unpleasant smelling -- one would never guess that it has urea in it.I've been using it liberally on my feet, knees and elbows, especially, and it seems to make my feet and lowerlegs reddish for a few hours, which concerns me a bit. Maybe it's just enhancing the circulation to those areas, as it hasno color effect on the rest of my body, so I don't think I'm having some kind of significant reaction to it.It soaks in pretty quickly, feels good, and after just a week or soof daily use my elbows are much less scaly and scratchy, which is remarkable.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,November 1, 2015,B014QVWLUA,Excipial Urea Hydrating Healing Lotion, 6.7 Ounce,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014QVWLUA,Galderma Laboratories, Inc,$14.99

I use this when I'm in a rush, because it's a one-step shampoo/conditioner, and it lets me skip the long middle rinse to get the shampoo out of my hair before conditioning. It leaves my hair a little different that my other products, and I feel like I need to was my hair again a little sooner.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Another splendid Heyer romance!,Another terrific romance by Georgette Heyer, masterful writer of period romances. While not hysterically funny like my favorite Heyer, "The Grand Sophy", this more romantic book has lots of wonderful characters, many of them in love, and a terrific plot involving repeated attempted murder. For some reason I tumbled to the real criminal about halfway through, as unlikely as that person seemed, but even that didn't disturb my enjoyment of the book as it unwound. In less than 350 pages Heyer creates nearly a dozen distinct and amusing characters. I didn't find Gervase, the lead, all that quiet, but he was a wonderful romantic hero. The main female lead has wonderful common sense and restraint, a challenging set of qualities to make come alive, but one roots for her all the way through. The dreadful older aristocratic woman who tries to control everyone is rather too close to some of Jane Austen's characters, rattling on about how she would have been an excellent horsewoman, had she cared for that sort of exercise. The servants are even given personalities and affectations. Once she has established that certain characters are dandies she spends remarkably little time carrying on about clothing, which pleases me. I love the way Heyer captures the language of the times without making it a bit hard to read or understand.Altogether an excellent book, fun for a rainy day or beach read. I'm stretching out her books, reading a couple a year, hoping to make them last, but it's hard not to just read them all at once.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 18, 2014,1402238835,The Quiet Gentleman (Regency Romances),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402238835,Sourcebooks Casablanca,$11.32
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Great book about a magical version of our world,4.5 starsReally good, but there was too much thinking inside the box -- the main character has to make her &#34;box of normal&#34; but can't save other people with it. Set in a magical version current day US, with people possessed of magic powers, some of whom can transform into animals like kittens, bunnies, and bears. The main character is a troubled fourth grade girl who resolves some of her issues during the story. I really hope this is the first of several books. A quick and well-written read, but I got tired really quickly of a character turning into a rock.Alice, age 8,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,June 27, 2015,0545800455,Upside-Down Magic (Upside-Down Magic #1),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545800455,Scholastic Press,$8.24
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Original mystery novel set in Boston,Slow start, terrific finish. It took me more than a week to push through the first third or so of the book, as we meet stacks of characters and start the copying process. Clare is gradually revealed as less than upstanding -- succeeding at her art is what drives her, and sleeping with a married man and letting him use her painting as his forms the background of the story. But once the copy is finished and she starts working, first painting her own series and then desperately researching the painting that she copied to save her lover, one likes her and the book better. I read the last half very quickly, and enjoyed it. The mystery of the Degas painting is solved, even as the mystery of the Gardner heist remains unknown.I admired the way the author put Clare into a rich and fairly detailed life, with friends, a loft studio, and a very real city of Boston. I love reading books I know well.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Great Big Mat!,I always work myself to the sides, top and bottom, and off my mat, so that I spend lots of time &#34;scooching&#34; myself back over, which is distracting. I asked my instructor first, since my mat would clearly take more room than the others, and she agreed that it would be a good idea. It seems about a third larger than a regular mat. It's almost like having my own little padded yoga room. It's certainly squishier than my old one had gotten, after many years. The only downside is obvious: it's heavy and more awkward. Luckily I only have to carry it a hundred feet or so. But I do spend less thought in class on where I am and getting back onto the mat.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,April 11, 2015,B00NFX96QI,Yoga Accessories(TM) Extra Wide and Extra Long 1/4'' Thick Deluxe Yoga Mat (Purple),Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFX96QI,YogaAccessories,$24.99

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Fun book for fairly new readers,My seven-year-old niece reports that this book, the first in a series of at least eight, is excellent, the perfect book for her RIGHT NOW. She read it in less than a day, in perhaps an hour of actual reading time, which makes me wonder if it's a little too young for her, even though she's at the younger end of the range the publisher provides along with each book. Combining the princess thing with the pony thing is kind of brilliant. The strong little girl main character is a plus to me. My niece loves the provided bracelet and the first horseshoe charm -- each additional book will come with one charm, although only this one has the easily adjustable bracelet. She liked Peggy, the flying horse the best, she says, perhaps because she enjoys mythology and loves Pegasus. The illustrations are plentiful, and suggest to her actual ponies and horses, not plastic toys. I ordered the second book for her today.

When we leave the tower for the city, my interest flagged. There were too many new characters, and the story, which was always pretty dark, became pretty gruesome.

Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Early Investigative Reporter,I don't think I would have ordered this book if I'd realized itis supposed to be &#34;young adult&#34;, suitable for those over 12.But I'm glad to have read it and to have learned more about the&#34;muckraker&#34; era of US history. Ida herself remains a bit of acypher -- a very early career woman who did not really supportthe suffragettes or suffrage for women, and who apparently hadno romantic relationships in her life. The important thingabout Ida was her work, journalism and business history. Sheworked extremely hard and wrote biographies of Lincoln that restoredhim to a role as an American hero. Perhaps her most important workwas her expose of Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company, whichmakes Enron look like Sunday School.She published mainly in McClure's magazine, the first Americanmagazine to develop investigative journalism. Sam McClure, itsco-founder, seems like he might be the really interesting personin this book, as he sounds fascinating and quite tragic. Theonly biography of him seems to be an ancient one by Willa Cather,unfortunately.While it might have been more interesting to have a deeper, moreadult picture of Ida's life, the limited material available onthis extremely discreet and private woman might not really makesuch a biography any more compelling. It's an easy read, andheld my interest.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 1, 2014,0547290926,Ida M.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Expensive but very cool,This pepper mill is a bit overwhelming. It was appropriately packaged without excessive layers. I hadn't realized it was an electric mill, powered by six AAA batteries, which were provided. It also came with a small users' manual for installing the batteries and the pepper, in five languages. I found the print size a bit small and required lots of light to read it clearly. I was pleased that I had an MIT engineer handy for consulting as I tried to remove the motor from its cylinder (i used a pencil point to move the clips), install the batteries, and then put the motor back, which I did backwards the first time. After I followed the directions and put it back together I discovered that I needed to take the motor cylinder off again to fill the pepper chamber. The whole process took about 20 minutes. We all enjoy &#34;taking the Peugeot for a spin&#34;, with it's cute little light. Being able to adjust the grind is nice. The pepper seems to last a long time -- we've only refilled it once or twice in more than six months of daily use.The device is solid and of very high quality, and lights up softly when in use. One should pulse it, not just push it on and keep holding it down. I like that one can vary the grind size.I enjoyed reading on the box that the Peugeot Company started out making saws in 1814 and moved on to coffee and pepper mills, and was the first to make a mill designed for the table. I felt at first that I would have preferred a regular hand-twist mill, but this one is very, very cool. I can understand why it costs so much, even as I continue to wonder why I couldn't turn my own grinder handle. For anyone who wants an elegant and elaborate way to grind pepper, this is pretty perfect.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,August 26, 2014,B004OW51CC,Peugeot Elis Sense U-Select Pepper Mill,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW51CC,PSP USA, LLC Peugeot,$83.74

I have sleep apnea, and I find that it works very well with my BiPap machine/mask, protecting my hair from the velcro straps and again, keeping it controlled.

The shoe feels nice and squishy, but fit is fine, the heel height is good, and I put it on for the first time and wore it to work all day with no problems. So I'd recommend it.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,2,Not as interesting as one would expect,My very mature tweener just discovered that she loves horses this summer at camp, so I thought she'd enjoy reading this lovely-looking book. Unfortunately, she reports that it was confusing, jumping around from one topic to another, switching just as she became interested in the first one.She found that very frustrating, and kept putting it down, only able to read half a chapter at a time. The quality of the writing was good but would be better if there were fewer long scientific names. The pictures would be great if the captions were below the pictures, not on the next page over (okay, she's picky).

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Wonderful but painful book,I'd had this book for several weeks when I finally made myself start reading it -- I was dreading what I expected to be a dark and painful book. It is, but I LOVED it, and will definitely look for the author's next books. But it troubles me to have my preconceptions about Afghan life confirmed, and even worsened. I want to believe that the terrible cost of restrictive gender roles for men and women might at least give solid loving and permanent families, but no, in this book family life is hellish, with violence, drug addiction, and constant cruelty. The happiest place in the book is the King's Harem, where there is no normal family life. Women in this book are property, both in the earlier story set in thefirst part of the 20th century, and in the modern story set in the recent past. In fact the texture of the women's lives is identical in the two times. While there are intimations that occasionally there is fondness between husbands and wives, what we see is brutality, and sex as an obligation the woman has to provide and submit to.The main characters are wonderful, young women finding ways to survive and escape intolerable conditions.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,April 20, 2015,0062244752,The Pearl that Broke Its Shell: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062244752,William Morrow,$19.56

But I could get a bigger, fluffier towel for less than half the price at my discount store. If it cost $14.99 I might think better of it.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,3,OK detergent badly presented.,The detergent seems to work fine, and get clothes clean. But instead of a handle one can grip, there's just an indentation, which makes it clumsy and awkward to handle. Also the cap and the instructions don't work well together, so that it's not possible to figure out how much detergent one is supposed to use: the small part of the cap, or the whole cap?

The handle is terrific -- very comfortable, easy to grip, and it didn't get hot at all while cooking pan after pan of French toast. The heat seemed quite evenly distributed, with no burnt or raw spots on the bread. It rinsed clean with no scrubbing.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Women Just Doing It,Reshma Saujani is a lawyer, activist, and founded Girls Who Code. All of the issues revealed in that list inform this book. Basically, girls can allegedly do anything  so why arent they?One of the major stumbling blocks, as she sees it, is that women are also still raised not to be ambitious, not to take risks, and both competition among women and collective or collaborative action are socially unsupported and hard to find. This book poses a number of counteractions. Many of these moves are supported by the stories she tells of women who took new roads and broke new ground; their successes back up her position that the way for women to change this state is to collectively do the things we have not done, refuse to let fear control our actions, and, when confronted by a brick wall, go around it. This is a good example of a book of this genre; it doesnt suffer so much as Lean In from the just do everything, all the time problem, nor does it diminish the difficulty of living the kind of life that results from successful application of her recommendations. If I had to recommend only one book to a young woman venturing out into the world, this would probably be it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,June 17, 2014,0544027787,Women Who Don't Wait in Line: Break the Mold, Lead the Way,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544027787,New Harvest,$13.80

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Nimoy and Spock,This is a pleasant book, mostly for readers interested in Star Trek, about Nimoy's career as Spock, with some information about his other dramatic and directorial roles. I read it right after reading George Takei's &#34;To the Stars&#34;, which is better, mostly because Takei had a much more interesting and full life, starting with his experiences as a child in the Japanese-American campus during WWII, and then his activist/political work. Nimoy admits to having a personal life (Takei in 1994 was not in a position to talk about his) but keeps it completely generic (wife and kids).Many things surprised me -- Roddenberry seems to have disappeared from Star Trek after the first two seasons, never reappearing, at least for Nimoy, as an artistic force for Star Trek. Unlike Takei, Nimoy only mentions Shatner's artistic megalomania once or twice, and seems to have managed not only to get along with him but actually to have liked him.I always wondered why, after directing the astonishingly successful &#34;Three Men and a Baby&#34; that set box office records, Nimoy didn't go on to a major career as a Hollywood director. Perhaps it was the problematic &#34;The Good Mother&#34; that killed that.The whole theme of Nimoy and Spock having dialogs didn't do much for me. I'm not sure that I believe that Spock was such a sustained and significant role in his career that Spock would be in his head.Anybody who is interested in Star Trek and Spock should definitely read this -- at the price it's more than worth it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,May 4, 2014,0786861827,I Am Spock,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786861827,Hyperion,$0.01

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Eight Short Stories of the Subcontinent,One of my favorite genres is fiction written by expats, usually women,from the South Asia. This sampling of eight stories, most a littleless than 30 pages long, while written by a man, is very good.They're more studies of character, place, and culture, rather thanplot-driven. In some, not much really happens. At the beginning ofeach story is a simple line map with one exception showing thenortheastern corner of the subcontinent, from Bangladesh to Bhutan andNepal, with India winding around them. On each map the places wherethe story takes place are shown. The last map is of the northeasternUS, and the story is set in NYC, about two people from that same littlesection of the world. At the very beginning I feared that the storieswould be too alien for me, as the opening one is of a young servantgirl with a cleft palate being controlled by promises of correctivesurgery, education, and a glamorous future. But I quickly settledinto them, and enjoyed them more and more as they continued. They'revery well written, and long enough to develop their characters andtheir context. All of them involve women, which was a relief.Anyone who enjoys stories about the subcontinent and its people shouldenjoy these a lot.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 14, 2014,162365145X,The Gurkha's Daughter,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/162365145X,Quercus,$0.69

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,The Grand Tour the Slow Way,This novel is based on a real story, a state which always makes me simultaneously dread and anticipate reading a book. In this case, Maud Caseys writing is  as always  so good that the book is excellent.The story is intriguing, a man, Albert, walks. He walks all over Europe. His problem is that he doesnt remember walking or know where he is. Albert suffers from what we now call fugue states during which he is compelled to walk hundreds of miles, of which he has no memory. He is simply somewhere Else than he was when he began to lose time.That Albert does this in 19th century France makes this a potentially dangerous situation; those who were considered mad were not treated particularly well and he was the first person we now recognize as having had fugues. Then, he was simply mad. Alberts story is told both from his point of view and from that of his doctor. For the time, Albert is lucky in his doctor, who actually tries to treat him, who maintains a conversation with him over many years. In Caseys world this eventually leads to a resolution of the Alberts problems. The Man Who Walked Away is a fascinating book, beautifully written and I loved it. The only thing I dislike about it is that after about page 100, I got tired of the fact that she doesnt name her characters but rather entitles them with initial caps, for example: the Doctor, the Veteran, etc. The Reader found this a bit wearing, but otherwise thought the book was excellent.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,June 17, 2014,1620403110,The Man Who Walked Away: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1620403110,Bloomsbury USA,$21.27

A small dab handled my face, neck and upper chest, and rinsed off fairly easily. Since one is supposed to start by using it just once a day and &#34;work up&#34; to twice a day (how will I know my face is ready for twice a day?) it should last a long time.I'll come back to this review in a few weeks and report any changes in my skin.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 28, 2015,B00OKD69N0,Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Acne Hater Deep Scrub, Salicylic Acid, 5 Fluid Ounce,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKD69N0,Procter & Gamble - HABA Hub,$6.99

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,3,Not all that easy!,We probably shouldn't have tried to use this product for the first time the morning after returning from a vacation, but we needed an activity, so we did. Both my 8-year-old niece and I read the instructions all the way through before starting, and watched the video. I'm not handy at all. Looping the threads around the hooks created a huge mess of tangles that took me over half an hour to straighten out, but I did remember about turning skeins of yarn into balls from a brief knitting attempt, and tried to do that, only to create yet another tangle. The instructions should definitely suggest doing that first, and include little forms to make that easier with the threads. Eventually we got the core made and proceeded. It was difficult but seemed to be going okay until the very end, when the knots proved too much for us and we had to bring in more talented help. The result displeased my niece because there was a gap of plain 'core' between the wrapped part of the bracelet and the knots. Nevertheless she put it on and wore it, but definitely didn't want to try again with another one right then. I'm not sure what to do to get rid of the gap, besides just experiment and get somebody handier to help out.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,August 16, 2015,B0060LLICC,Loopdedoo Spinning Loom Kit Friendship Bracelet Maker,Toys & Games,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060LLICC,Ann Williams Group, LLC,$27.41
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Misses the Boat on Social Media,Denise Lee Yohs book on brand development and management in the modern world is excellent on most of its points. She outlines and discusses all the ways in which the most successful brands today are managing to improve their images that would - in an earlier era - have been viewed as being at least bad practice, if not fatal for the brand itself. Her examples extend from Tiffany to Tedx, from Tylenol to The Container Store. She takes the reader through each case and elucidates what went wrong and how it was fixed. Nearly always, her cases boil down to delivering what customers expect and desire, but there are many nuances to that simple statement and she sees and writes about them clear and succinctly.The only way I can fault the book is that she pays insufficient attention to the phenomenon of social media. She brushes past it on a few occasions and mentions it now and then, but she doesnt demonstrate the power of the social media to bring a brand to its knees with a day of tweets about a single incident (Barelli, for example) and similar influences. Nor does she discuss the importance of corporate response in on-line fora to remarks, complaints, or statements of displeasure. In our world, the social media have an overwhelming influence on public perception of brand and her would have been well-served by saying more directly on the topic.Other than that, its a good book. It isnt field-defining nor is it the only book of its kind, but its a worthy entry in the space.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,April 30, 2014,111861125X,What Great Brands Do: The Seven Brand-Building Principles that Separate the Best from the Rest,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111861125X,Jossey-Bass,$22.80
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,3,King David Up Close and Personal,I've read and enjoyed several other books by this author and enjoyed them, although I wouldn't call any of them an easy read. I always found the Biblical story of David interesting, as it seems like one of the few stories about a real, flawed person that we get in the Old Testament. Job and Jonah, or even Moses, never felt very real. The story about David dishes some dirt, but of course there's still a lot we don't know.I liked the way that the author tried to put us into a very different and ancient culture, although I wished for a glossary and a map. I can't say that I really liked David, but I did enjoy reading about him, and would recommend this book to anyone interested in him and Old Testament times.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 21, 2015,0670025771,The Secret Chord: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670025771,Viking,$17.05
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Goodbye St Petersberg,I didn't read this book as a memoir but as an emotional analysis ofElena's journey at 23 from St Petersberg to New Jersey. It's emotionallycharged, with many realizations from looking back at her life and thecommitments she made to her mother, older sister, and friends. Her attemptto separate herself from Russian culture and make her American life feelnatural and real, which was very difficult for her. At every stepof her new life there would be circumstances and events that would evokeparallel but conflicting reactions from her Russian perspective. This was confusingand disorienting.Marrying a man who accepted her for who she was helped her to understandand learn American life and that was very lucky for her, as she found not just ahusband but a true friend who didn't expect her to shed all of herRussian emotional baggage as quickly or completely as other Americans she knewexpected her to do.The main point she was trying to make is to rationalize to herself whyyou can leave Russia, but Russia will always be there inside you forthe rest of your life, complicating assimilating into American lifeand achieving new relationships. The author finally managed to stop looking ateverything from the point of view of Russian fears and to accept her new lifeas a challenge that she could meet by separating herself from her &#34;Mother's&#34;dominance.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 20, 2015,1451689829,Russian Tattoo: A Memoir,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451689829,Simon & Schuster,$19.80

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,I've got smooth soft hair,I just used this product for the first time after my swim. The texture was pleasant, a very small amount covered all of my long hair very well, and the smell was kind of tropical fruity, and not too strong, although definitely noticeable. It was easy to comb my always-tangled hair out. It was no more difficult to rinse out than other conditioners I use. My hair definitely feels soft and looks smooth, not frizzy.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,The only thing you need in the shower! Plus minty smell,I used this product yesterday, and found it did the job. It has that kind of vaguely minty smell characteristic of a lot of men's cleaning products, only a little too strong for my taste. I like the three-in-one thing, as it means less to carry around to the gym. It left my hair clean, and did a great job on my skin, and was easy to rinse off. Usually these combined products fail as conditioners on me, as I need heavy conditioning and am looking for something to help me comb my very tangle-prone hair out in the shower. This worked pretty well at that, but then was a bit hard to rinse out. My hair has that minty smell pretty strongly, even dry.So I'll use it up, but I probably will keep looking for something that rinses out better and doesn't smell quite so strongly.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 13, 2015,B00T9R1VPS,AXE 3 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner + Body Wash, Total Fresh, 22 Ounce,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T9R1VPS,AXE,$9.69

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,A Truly Gripping History Book!,4 1/2 starsI've never approached a book feeling so much hostility to what I took tobe its main idea. I had a boyfriend in the 70s who was insistent thata person's life and personality could be predicted based on where inthe US they were born and grew up, like a sort of geographical astrology.Luckily that's not what this book is about at all. This book is abouthistory, politics, and culture, not so much about individuals, andit's fascinating. One does have to accept "founders bias", wherethose who originally settled an area mostly determine its politicalstructure, culture, and attitudes, even if very different people comein droves later. Boston, for example, is still a Yankee city, despitethe thousands of Irish and Italians who swamped the Puritans in the19th century. New York City's culture and politics are still deeplyaffected by the Dutch who settled it in the 17th century despite thehundreds of cultures that have affect it since then.The author's biases troubled me. He seems to quite like "NewNetherlands" the greater New York City "nation", and the Quaker/German"Midlands", while despising the Deep South, the Far West, and to alesser extent Greater Appalachia. I would have liked a more balancedapproach. There must be *something* good he could find about theculture of the Deep South!Nevertheless that book definitely makes a lot of sense in its analysisof some of the more mysterious aspects of our past and present.It's a pretty easy read, especially the first third or so of it ashe introduces us to each of North America's 11 "nations". I think thesocial studies classes I took in school mostly minimized the differencesbetween each of the colonies as they developed, where the author herestresses the differences. It definitely renders the Civil War morecomprehensible. I found myself quite caught up in the book, evena bit obsessed. I learned lots of useful things, and have enjoyeddiscussing its ideas with friends.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,April 29, 2014,0143122029,American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122029,Penguin Books,$12.97

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Amazing Biography of Tragic Woman,This brilliant biography unravels the life of Alice Sheldon, abrilliant, beautiful, talented but very broken woman who became thesuccessful and edgy science fiction author known as James Triptree,Jr. It's amazing that the author was able to find so much materialand interview so many people who knew this mostly-reclusive woman, andachieve such depth of understanding of her. How I wish that Alice hadfound a truly insightful psychiatrist who could have led her to faceherself, get off speed and treat her emotional problems directly.Sadly she saw male doctors who all-but-ignored her sexuality, and herfear and attraction to death.Minor quibble: the author repeatedly states that Alice is &#34;flirting&#34;with her correspondents in her letters to science fiction authors,editors, etc. Nothing that she quoted seemed to me to be flirting,just compliments and praise, with little innuendo.Anyone who enjoys biographies, especially of interesting andstrong-but-tragic women, will love this book. Unfortunately it'sa tragic story that caused me to cry several times. NeverthelessI loved it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,May 17, 2014,0312426941,James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Everyday political violence,It's always interesting reading a book translated from Arabic, as the language is vivid and rather florid. This work is no exception. The language is strangely suited to this subject -- the first popular uprising against the current Syrian regime, back in the 1980s. Although the book is written by a man, it's told from the point of view of a young woman who is involved in the violence. For those of us who have little real sense of what "sectarian violence" means, here it is described in detail as it grows and develops, and leads to its horrible conclusion.It was difficult to understand the class and social situation of the main characters, single women in a society where everyone is strongly required to marry, whether they wish to or not. Never has sexual repression been presented so lushly and physically.I found this book hard to read, yet compelling. The violence and brutality are painful, and it was difficult to identify with the main character or understand her motives. But it is well-written and translated, and added greatly to my understanding of the backstory to current events in Syria.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 30, 2014,1250052343,In Praise of Hatred: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250052343,Thomas Dunne Books,$17.46

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,A beautiful pared-down novel,The story is intensely focused on the two teenagers/young adults, and their environments, both in the &#34;real world&#34; and in the alternate world they find and explore together. This pared-down effect did not make it seem thin because of the amazingly rich descriptions of the alternate world, which was totally different every time they visited, even changing while they explored it. The book moved around in time as well as place, but I little problem understanding when we were in their high school years and when we had jumped five years ahead. Instead this became another aspect of the fantastical nature of the story. Despite the fantasy, there's plenty of darkness in the tale.The book is especially beautifully designed, and I strongly encourage people to read in on paper, not on Kindle, etc. The art conveyed and embodied the story. I found it an extremely easy read, especially the last half, which I read glued to my chair, not wanting it to end.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Terrific thriller set in 1926 England,4.8 starsMystery/thrillers are definitely outside my main reading diet, butthis novel by the author of the Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes series was so much fun to read that I slowed way down and took two weeks to read it, and was very sad when it ended. It has terrific characters, and not just the main ones. I was fascinated by Bennett Grey, whose horrific WWI injuries left him so sensitive to the noises, smells and sights around him that it's as if he can read minds, and people who are lying, or evil, cause him severe physical pain. What an interesting change on the Sherlock Holmes syndrome that is -- like an extreme version, only relatively helpless.If there's any downside to this book it's the English &#34;house party&#34; at a grand estate, that goes on for days and days, recounted in what feels like real time detail over 200 plus pages. Lots of it was wonderful, but it all got to be a bit too much.I'd love to see a movie, or better, a miniseries, of this. It's got a couple of strong, interesting women characters, along with a great bad guy. And as a mystery/thriller it kept me going almost to the end, guessing at the central puzzle.I was very happy to realize that there's a second book in what's now a series, and have ordered it and can't wait.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 14, 2015,B000W96882,Touchstone: A Stuyvesant & Grey Novel (Harris Stuyvesant Book 1),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W96882,Bantam,$11.99
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Please get this on AUDIO!,WHY is this book, unlike ALL of the others, not available at all on audio??? The others in this series are read by the brilliant Mary Robinette Kowal. It's just not the same. We always listen to these books in the car on trips or while commuting, and our 8-year-old loves listening to them but won't be able to read them for years.Our whole family loves the October Day series on audio. This was my first time actually reading one of the books, and it was quite a different experience, missing all the different voices and accents. The structure of this book seems different -- I didn't like the way that Quentin disappears totally from the action half way through, after having had nothing much to do, and NEVER reappears.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Wild building blocks!,4 1/2 starsI had a family party last night and got out my new, unopened toy for everybody to enjoy. The 8-year-old niece loved these blocks, and immediately started building an amazing &quot;kooky Japanese house&quot;. We supervised the one-year-old, who just wanted to hold one of the ones with a hole in it, and made sure she didn't put it in her mouth. The two senior citizens built 'temple gates&quot; -- mine was meant to be Egyptian, and my partner's was in the Asian direction. I found the multitude of colors off-putting -- I think of modern and post-modern architecture as glassy, shiny, or cream colored, not these supersaturated colors of yellow, blues, orange, green, purples, etc. Not every piece comes in every color, and I would have liked to be able to have pairs of things in the same colors. The colors distracted me from the shapes and figuring out what to build. Some of the shapes were totally inscrutable to me. There are pieces with cylindrical holes in them that cry out for a matching dowel that would fit through them, but there aren't any dowels. But these are all minor start-up complaints. The quality of my set seemed fine -- I didn't notice any rough spots or other defects. I look forward to my next occasion to try my hand at building something more elaborate. The book that came with the set tells about various famous modern and post-modern architects, and shows a few buildings. It has a list of all the parts and a couple of examples of buildings built from them. I would have appreciated more suggestions, but perhaps they're on the website, which I didn't want to access during my party. http://www.tsshure.com/archiquest-modern-post-modern-architecture-building-blocks/ gives you a good idea of what a structure looks like.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,October 25, 2015,B003Y5B764,Shure Products Modern Architecture Painted Edition,Toys & Games,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y5B764,T.S.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Effective but dangerous product?,I'm not sure how to review this. It contains triclosan (check the other reviews for more info about this chemical) which is apparently dangerous.This product has the sort of &#34;clay&#34; feeling I associate with some facial mask products, which to me is a pleasant texture compared to lotions, etc. It has a sort of waxy feel to it, too, reminding me slightly of that lovely post-paraffin feeling at the nail salon. Using a small-to-moderate amount of it, I found it soaked into my skin quickly, not requiring a whole lot of rubbing. My feet felt a bit better after the first use, and definitely improved significantly after a few days of daily application.So if you're not afraid of triclosan, this seems to be an effective product. But why take risks? We're all exposed to enough toxins every day.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,October 25, 2015,B004SUY46E,AHAVA Dead Sea Mud Dermud Intensive Foot Cream, 3.4 fl. oz.,Luxury Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SUY46E,AHAVA,$26.50

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Fascinating but hard to read,It's a fascinating story: the average party-animal guy almost predictably sustains serious physical damage in an attack or fight, and turns into a mathematical, geometric, synthesthetic genius. Not something you see around the house every day.Jason Padgett lays out his story well. Its narrative is clear and easy to follow. The character of pre-damage Jason is clearly drawn and you know that you've met a hundred guys just like him. This serves to make the results of the cranial damage he suffers when he's struck by a 2x4 all the more interesting and makes the story much more compelling, but there are definite problems with his writing.Not surprisingly, he retells the pre-damage portion of his story in a very clinical way. The story is complete and descriptive but it read like a report given by a disinterested third-party. Of course, Jason is in the odd position of *being* a disinterested third party to his own story. He no longer has any mental or emotional connection to that person who shares his name and who occupied his body. He knows what happened, and he tells you all about it, but it is only tangentially related to the person he is today.Jason's emotional connection to his earlier life is almost entirely manifest through his reactions to skills, abilities and reactions that he has no previous connection to. He's synthesthetic now, so even the most normal thing, like water flowing from a tap looks like a series of triangles; he's a mathematical and geometric genius, so he sees in those triangles patterns and relationships that were invisible to his old mind. His resulting panic, OCD and agoraphobia are the most understandable and accessible portions of the book.As he pulls himself together, he returns to the far more studied way of writing that characterized the first part. This time it seems to be more that this is where his mind now lives. It's where he's comfortable and how he naturally reports things. But it is still somewhat alien.This is a great book in terms of the events, the results, the history of his condition and an excellent, detailed telling of Jason's story. Read it if those things interest you. It is not a compelling read; no compulsive page turner here, which is somewhat sad, since I can't escape believing that the life he's lived, of itself, is worthy of a compelling book.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 22, 2014,0544045602,Struck by Genius: How a Brain Injury Made Me a Mathematical Marvel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544045602,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,$18.39
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Long, complex, and satisfying.,I've watched many of the Masterpiece Mystery Lynley/Havers shows, and enjoyed them a lot, so I thought I'd try reading one that I was sure I hadn't watched as a TV show. Naturally the book has a bit of a different character than the shows, even though I of course saw the actors in at least the main character roles.I enjoyed getting more depth with Havers -- I don't recall any of the shows featuring her as much as this book does. Other reviewers have mentioned the length of the book and its complexity, and I certainly agree. If the shows had been this complicated and long each story would have taken years to work through. But the book definitely pulled me in, especially once things got rolling. By the end I didn't want it to stop.I think this is a fine place to start for those who have only seen the show, and I'm glad I didn't try to go back to the beginning and read ones where I'd already know who did it and why. It's surprising to me that Ms. George is American -- as far as I can tell she's got the whole English thing really down.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,3,This 'bildungsroman' doesn't quite work for me.,Novels by expats from the subcontinent are a specialty of mine,and I believe this author may have some great books inside her.But this wasn't one of them, for me.I think part of the problem may have been that the slice of Indianculture transplanted to British Columbia as presented by the authorisn't attractive in any way at all, and the main character seems todespise it. It's dysfunctional, nobody isvery happy, and there's just very little 'upside' to it. There'stoo little attractiveness to the traditional Indian culture asit's presented. Immersed in modern Canadian culture, well-educatedand attractive, it's inevitable that our heroine will leave for the larger world.She sticks around so long, when there seem to bepeople who would help her leave her situation all through the book,mostly because she's indecisive.The ending was pretty melodramatic. But the book heldmy interest and I look forward to better books from her in the future.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 22, 2014,0143186817,Everything Was Good-bye,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143186817,Pintail,$14.17
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Great book from a favorite author.,Sharon Shinn is one of my favorite authors. Her fantasy and SF just works for me. I like the edge of romance she treads. Reading her books is like visiting another world. It's great to see that she's being very prolific right now, and I can't wait to read her new stuff.This book reminds me quite a bit of Audrey Niffenegger's &#34;The Time Traveler's Wife&#34;, but not in a derivative way. Here the protagonist's beloved sister is a shapeshifter, and we get to see the author's take on how that would play out in our ordinary 21st century American world.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,July 3, 2014,0425256812,Still Life with Shape-Shifter (A Shifting Circle Novel),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425256812,Ace Books,$0.02

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,Second pair, just as good as the first,I bought a pair of these in black patent croc nearly two years ago, and have enjoyed wearing them and received constant positive comments on them. It's wonderful to have a pair of comfortable flats that dress an outfit up the way that sleek heels would. So when I saw these on sale in plain navy leather, I grabbed them. As I'd hoped they look entirely different in plain, non-patent navy, a bit less dressy, but still very nice, and just as comfortable as my first pair, which is still going strong after many all-day wearings. I hope that Clarks will keep offering these, perhaps in more colors, for a long time to come.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 23, 2014,B002CML8O6,Clarks Women's Timeless Loafer,Navy,10 W US,Shoes,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CML8O6,none,none
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,Meet Guido Brunetti,4 1/2 starsI read this book six years ago, and it led me to start reading allof the author's Brunetti series. My book group chose to read thisone, so after all this time I returned to reread it.This book is quite different from the later books in several ways.There's no Signorina Elettra, no sidekick officer, and less emphasison food, either in his home or in the many bars and cafes Brunettifrequents in the later book. There's one meal at home, which is notlovingly described, and one restaurant meal, where the emphasis isMUCH more on the waitress than the food. No yummy little tettrazinesandwiches. Similarly, while the major landmarks of Venice arementioned, there are fewer loving descriptions.Perhaps more significantly, the focus of this book is not on thecorruption and the murkiness of Italian law and society, and there'srelatively little mention of pollution and environmental decline. There's oneincidence of municipal construction corruption, but nothing concerningthe courts, etc. Brunetti's boss, Patta, is in a way the embodimentof sleaziness and corruption, but here he's mostly a slacker takingcredit for Brunetti's work.I found the resolution of the mystery quite disturbing, for reasons I can'tdiscuss without giving way too much away.Despite these differences from the later books, I loved this one: it's setting, many of thecharacters, the mystery, and the resolution. I highly recommend goingback to it for those who've read any of the other Brunetti book.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 30, 2014,B000A1773C,Death at La Fenice,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A1773C,Harper Perennial,$0.89
Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,4,First Alan Banks Mystery,Having read &#34;Watching the Dark&#34;, and &#34;Before the Poison&#34; (the latter is not an Inspector Banks mystery) I wanted to read the very first Banks book and see where the author started. Strangely it still feels as if one has started mid-series. He's already left London for small town Yorkshire, is married to Sandra, has two kids, and is a detective. He's found Yorkshire to be surprisingly crime-ridden, and has already solved some major crime and been there about a year when this book opens. Still, the town is described, with map and in the text, in great detail, which helps a lot. It's an easy read, with lots of crime, and delicious criminals. At least one major plot point seems to be totally abandoned and unresolved. I like knowing that there are many other books from this series I can read when I want a nice British mystery.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,May 25, 2014,B00CRASOFO,Gallows View (Inspector Banks series Book 1),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CRASOFO,Scribner,$11.99

I tried to read &#34;qualities&#34; for blessings all the time. But I liked this world and the people in it, and look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series. I'm not sure what people mean about the book being long or dull -- I read it in a couple of days and found it hard to put down.

Anne M.

Both were scholarship students who then taughtyoung women. The vicar's daughter marries the farmer's daughter'sbrother, while the farmer's daughter continues to teach and demonstratefor the vote. The author makes this difference in choices a sourceof discomfort and unease between the two women, as they have difficultyaccepting each other's different choices. This made me question the depth oftheir friendship and understanding of each other. This alienation feels a littleartificial, as if invented solely to give the book some early dramatic tension.The book deals with the onset of the war, and travels to the trenchesin France. It was a very quick read, a bit simply written, and I feltthat apart from the two women the characterizations were a bit thinand sketchy. The love story was wonderfully conveyed in letter.

Anne M. Hunter,A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,5,A Primer on Thought Leadership,Being a thought leader is a critical aspect of making your way in many fields, multiple career paths, and a variety of social, political and professional networks. Figuring out what it takes to achieve thought leadership has long been a black art. Some people seem to acquire it even though most others in their field will agree that So-and-so is not someone you want to listen to. In this environment, the desire of many to achieve pre-eminence in their fields and to have their expertise acknowledged is hardly surprising. Denise Brosseau's book gives you the map to how to achieve such a reputation. She lays out the details of how to navigate the path to Thought Leader clearly and in detail. Not only is it an excellent primer but it's a good read. She writes well and easily and following her is a pleasure.Now that I have the keys, I must run: Thought Leadership awaits.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,March 22, 2014,1118647610,Ready to Be a Thought Leader: How to Increase Your Influence, Impact, and Success,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118647610,Jossey-Bass,$21.71

It's pretty gentle, which to me isn't a bad thing, but if you want to stun people with a forceful stream of water, this doesn't do that. Even close up it's not strong. It does reach about 25 feet, and with the cap open you can simply keep reloading it by holding it under the water, where it does a nice &#34;glub glub&#34; of bubbles. While it's easy to use, it does take two hands to operate. In the pool there's no issue of its leaking -- you wouldn't even notice. It seems sturdy.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,A tremendously disturbing and well acted film,I vaguely remember seeing this movie (and it was indeed made-for-TV, which surprises me) around 2005.Perhaps some of the other viewers are a bit more hardened than myself in terms of what they watch; this movie has lingered in my memory ever since, especially Cary Elwes' performance. I'm sure a lot of forensic psych majors have seen this as it is practically an advertisement for the field.The story begins around the time that Theodore Robert Bundy (played here by Cary Elwes to a demonic perfection) brutal killer of an almost unknown number of women mailed Dr. Robert Keppel (the police investigator assigned to the capture of the Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway, who was caught in 2001) a letter from death row, claiming that he might have some &#34;insights&#34; into what their subject was doing, or what his habits might be. Keppel and his partner Dave Reichert (who would eventually capture Ridgway) were desperate enough to actually meet with Bundy and entertain his ideas.Cary Elwes seems like a nice, scholarly British actor. He must have been tugging real hard on his dark side, though, because it came out and his portrayal of the disempowered, imprisoned Bundy is a perfect--I mean Heath Ledger's Joker perfect--performance. Greenwood and Elwes have an almost perfect rapport; though he tells Keppel he can &#34;take him there without drowning&#34; (meaning into the mind of the Green River Killer) what he of course wants is precisely for him to drown, to become a warped monster like himself. Elwes delivers this well: Bundy was contemptuous of Keppel, contemptuous of his victims, and didn't represent anything but his own malign brain chemistry. He keeps comparing himself to others to infect them.There's a sort of black shamanism to all this, implications about the underbelly of the specifically male psyche which are truly foul. Kathleen Quinlan, beautiful as always, plays Keppel's wife, who urges him to pull back from his work. Though the horror genre works on some unpleasant material to achieve a (temporarily) cathartic effect, none of this is cathartic. This is all quite real, from the conversations to the victims and the implications about our society. The only justice in it all is the presence of two guys like Bob Keppel and Dave Reichert, who were willing to put brain and body--mostly brain--at stake to stop these guys.Definitely recommended for fans of the true crime genre.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,April 25, 2015,B006SV98L2,The Riverman,Amazon Video,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SV98L2,none,none
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,What is privacy?,Toward the end of this documentary the director shows up at Facebook CEO's (surprisingly small) house with a formal request for an interview. Zuckerberg responds, &#34;Are you recording?&#34; The director affirms that they are indeed doing just that. Zuckerberg responds, &#34;Could you please not?&#34; When the director turns the audio off, Zuckerberg smiles, seeming relieved, and is amicable.This capsizes the documentary. If every corporate mogul who sells our third party information to the government, law enforcement--all those who want &#34;Total Information Awareness&#34; as the government termed the program initially--want people to stop hacking, want entities like Anonymous to disappear, why don't they just stop recording everything we do via relentless internet profiling, algorithmic memorization and information, even pre-arrests. There was one school teacher who was arrested because he was about to perform some street theater in London before he even showed up to do it, and a 7th grader who was intercepted by the FBI for congratulating Obama on the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.Some since the revelation of all this information have actually come out (and this is brave) to the public via the internet, saying: &#34;If you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to worry about?&#34; As is so often the case, the oppressed sing the same song as their oppressors without even knowing it: the Chief Executive of Google made the same statement when asked about, well, the general lack of privacy with Google's &#34;Terms and Conditions&#34;. &#34;If you have nothing to hide, don't worry about us selling your decade long search engine habits.&#34;Problem: the world is full of tons of people with tons of different viewpoints. In YOUR cultural template, what you view may be fine and dandy. But you can bet your bottom dollar that it isn't somewhere else. At some point, somewhere, you will answer to a security guard for it, or an airport customs official for it. It won't always be a few hours that you're reminded your rights don't actually matter: some day it might be for a considerably longer period. And then, who knows?Even if you're the lovely sort of person who &#34;knows&#34; someone in the NSA and has gotten the opportunity to look at your virtual profile and therefore feels secure, you can be assured you don't know everything and aren't really &#34;in the know&#34; to any huge degree.The more you concede, the greater the concessions are taken into account. Anyone with a background in sales will tell you your vulnerabilities are *always* on the table. The thing that's surprising is that as a culture we are totally cynical now. People have practically broken into little cells politically. Are we trusting Google, Amazon, YouTube, and Facebook because we trust them, or because we've reached that place where we let the &#34;Men In Black&#34; in the door not because we're so terrified, but because we just don't care anymore?,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,August 21, 2015,B00PV09C6W,Terms and Conditions May Apply,Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PV09C6W,none,none

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Beautiful metaphorical lyricism,Georges Franju's &#34;Eyes Without a Face&#34; is a poetic meditation on how the proverbial garbage gets dumped in a family or nation. It's also an Edgar Allan Poe-esque trip into a singularly nasty situation.Pierre Brasseur plays Doctor G&eacute;nessier, a surgeon who saves his daughter Christiane and wife Louise from dying in a car accident. His performance is chilling, and is obviously meant to recall the &#34;banality of evil&#34; Arendt observed in Eichmann. Just like a Nazi official, he considers it a normal and necessary thing to abduct female patients from his practice and remove their faces to provide a new one for Christiane (Edith Scob). His wife (Alida Valli) is just as bad, already having had a &#34;successful&#34; transplant and convinced her subtly perverted, compulsive, controlling husband will do the same for their daughter.The idea and reality of facial recognition and the nuclear family is what gives this film it's exquisitely horrible potency. Some (Christiane) in a tidy family must suffer and be shut away until their wounds are addressed for society; barring this, they must perish.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Excellent,This is an electric volume of poetry. Donald Revell is extremely well known in poetry for his translations and criticisms, but I had no idea of his actual intensity as a poet. &#34;Erasures&#34; covers just about every ground a poet can manage without the intensity abating at all. Everything from mass shootings to the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah are versified electrically.&#34;And Nothing But&#34;It is a white trainsees and makes it darker.Oh sustain it.I am in the wires.What happens in the light of institutions remains profound, though pleased too easily. The message and the man's head fingered in soap scum fade at one distance, at the same speed. Will later drown himself in Paris, in the yellow of institutions, pared down to a single holocaust fluorescent pipe.Misterunsaid goes to the grave,then everything.The use of talking,is vocable in nightmare,perhaps only there.&#34;This is a personal favorite poetry collection of mine and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys poetry.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,August 1, 2015,0819512060,Erasures (Wesleyan Poetry Series),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0819512060,Wesleyan,$14.95
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Sometimes the uncanny bites,May is an intensely troubled girl. She has a lazy eye (not from birth) and this seemingly minor disturbance blossoms into a series of crippling interpersonal problems.This film is sort of a gender switch version of the movie &#34;Love Object&#34; with Udo Keir. May has an impact far and above that movie, though.The protagonist spends a great deal of her time with animals working as a veterinarian's assistant. Part of May's pathology is that she likes *parts* of human beings rather than the whole. She falls in love with Adam, a mechanic played by Jeremy Sisto. He is an aspiring filmmaker obsessed with Dario Argento; by societal standards this would be strange enough, but even Adam realizes May is off in a way he can only dream of in his film scripts. The mutual attraction and repulsion constitute the heart of the movie, part of which is a meditation on cinema within cinema.Suzy, the doll, is the scariest part of the film; it constitutes May's inner being. Once that's fractured, things get *really* Argentoish.Terrifying.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,October 20, 2015,B00009MEC4,May,Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MEC4,Lions Gate,$8.10
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,4,Good.,This is a potent book. I would characterize it as a mishmash of Ernest Becker (first and foremost), Joseph Campbell, some Eastern writers, etc.Mr. Dee encourages us to face death, and to dissolve our egos in the acid of spirituality.Sometimes I have problems with books like this because they work so heavily on generalities. Dee states that &#34;we should savor every moment as if it were our last&#34; and delivers the carpe diem message. All vital existential urgings, of course, but is that really possible? In the rush and tumble of everyday life, in the flux of mental perception, in just the tiny increments of existence, can we always be doing this?Also, there's the mention of the Eastern philosopher Osho and his journey. Osho was a fraud who drove a cadillac, impregnated his female disciples, and just generally was not ego dead. Speaking of which, &#34;ego death&#34; is another complex matter. Is it possible to destroy the ego? Yes, in 1 in a million, sure. It is absolutely a worthy pursuit, of course.Dee also speaks of the need for a &#34;Master&#34; to destroy one's illusions and make oneself less fearful of death. A teacher, sure, but a *master*?Regardless of these issues, I thought it was a potent read.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,October 31, 2015,1515019918,The Power of Death: A Radical Path to Personal Transformation and Spiritual Enlightenment,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1515019918,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,$9.99
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Memento moratorium,With just a few false starts or longer scenes, say, with Jody's girlfriend or speculation on the Tall Man's identity, this wild ID acid trip/bad lucid dream of a movie may have been relegated to the MST3000 gallery. Indeed, there are scenes and snippets which are drop dead hilarious, like when Reggie (..played by actor Reggie Banister) asserts for the third time, head and body trembling, that he's going to &#34;stomp that tall f***er to the ground till he SCREAMS!&#34;But this movie is no joke. It has the quality of every genuinely ill, gross nightmare or too poignant a dream come to life. It is, in fact, a violating psychedelic meditation on death.The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) is the &#34;town undertaker&#34;. He has some odd equipment: dwarves, small silver balls containing a siphon and two blades that run riot in his immaculately clean mausoleum. Circumspect about the timing of his &#34;services&#34;, we're first introduced to the viewer when Jody (Bill Thornbury) attends a funeral. Popping out to reprimand him for his tardiness, he looks he's 7 ft tall and barks, &#34;The services are BEGINNING, sir!&#34;Though there's a backstory to the Tall Man (he's an alien who uses human bodies for a colony in another realm of space) I think he represents death. Actually I think all the films (especially this one) are emblematic of the inexorability of physical oblivion. Mike (Michael Baldwin) is messing around with his girlfriend in a cemetery when the whole commotion starts. She stabs him in the middle of an act not showing much respect for the dead. The link between sex and death is all over this movie. When a guy gets too relaxed with a chick, they are not preserving themselves; the fates are up to no good. Orgasm is oblivion.Jody, Mike's older brother, is the bravest but most foolhardy of the three. He wants to attack the Tall Man head on, figure out what makes him tick, destroy him, etc. It is clear things are a lot out of hand than that when Mike brings home the Tall Man's finger in a box and it has formaldehyde in it.Mike is smarter, never confronting the Tall Man head on and spending the majority of the movie running and keeping himself alive while still keeping his eye open. Smartest of all, predictably, is the eldest, Reggie, an ice cream man. He stays ignorant of the goings ons until it is impossible to ignore them; his weakness is old fashioned, simple chivalry.The funeral parlor is taking over the actual town; director Don Coscarelli does an excellent job of reversing the natural order of society and death's context. In this film it grows out, it is not insulated and ignored. And there's a bit of nasty physics going on: Mike walks into a vector space filled with purple smoke and tiny dwarves, infinitesimal creatures, the Tall Man's forbidden psychic space. He sees quite directly into the eyes of death till the elder of the tribe, Reggie, yanks him out. For a moment, a brief moment, Jody triumphs, trapping the Tall Man in a mine shaft and keeping him there with rocks. It is a fleeting moment; it turns out the entire thing was a dream, and that Jody had died driving his car.But, as Mike looks in the mirror, the Tall Man appears on the wall. Death is present in our narcissism especially. Mike is pulled inside the false safety of his own self image, and the movie ends.Coscarelli swore never to touch this again, and he probably shouldn't have. But who could resist a greater exploration of the Tall Man? And the sequel did contain that nightmarish, sick dream feel, but not quite like this one. A visionary experience.

It works well as all three but, all in all, it is Ray Milland's performance as this intense individual that makes it worthwhile.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,The chronicles of an emerald golgonooza,Kathleen Raine (14 June 1908  6 July 2003) had a singular and unmistakable talent: recognizing that the seemingly idiosyncratic bursts of imaginative power possessed by poets like David Emery Gascoyne or W.B. Yeats were not blots on the narrative of well respected materialist doggerel, but a manifestation of what they actually were. Just as there an order and meaning to the world of dreams, so did Yeats &#34;A Vision&#34; (which she makes much of) represent a substantial piece of his work. Much is made of Emmanuel Swedenborg and Yeats' fascination with him, but ultimately, Raine indexes the filaments of this great poet's labyrinthine vision and says what she often says: Poets are prophets, not to be laughed at or considered gloomy, sad fools.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,July 5, 2015,0903880725,W.B.Yeats and the Learning of the Imagination,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0903880725,Golgonooza Press,$8.40

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Hypnotic, beautiful music,Mad Season was an odd and unlikely coupling of The Screaming Trees, Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, and two members of Pearl Jam. Two shows were done at Seattle's More Theatre in 1995 of their performances; Mark Lanegan chimes in for one of the songs, &#34;Long Gone Day&#34;, but it was Layne Staley and the other musicians who made this so legendary. The playlist on the record look like this:River of DeceitLifeless Dead (live at the Moore)I Don't Know AnythingI'm AboveLong Gone DayLifeless DeadArtifical RedX-Ray MindAll AloneNovember HotelCD 1 features the original album + an unreleased acoustic instrumental titled &#34;Interlude,&#34; 3 new songs from the band's unfinished second album with newly recorded vocals and lyrics by Mark Lanegan and a remixed version of the band's John Lennon cover &#34;I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier.&#34;CD 2 features the full audio set from the bands historical performance at the Moore Theater in Seattle on April 29, 1995, remastered in stereo sound.The DVD features the first official DVD release of Live at The Moore - Mad Season's last show ever performed. Not only has Live at The Moore been remixed and remastered, but newly edited by director Duncan Sharp for a beautiful new documentary-like presentation, giving the show an updated look as if the viewer were in room that night. Also included are four performances that have never been seen, including the fan-favorite &#34;Wake Up.&#34;Also featured is a full concert of the bands performance from New Years Eve 1995 at RKCNDY in Seattle (which was shot by the band's crew for an up close and intimate look at the band) and both performances from Self-Pollution Radio, one newly edited.There's a rainy ambience about these songs that I've never quite heard in anything else. &#34;Wake Up&#34; is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard, with Staley prophesying his own demise and inability to decide how to stay healthy: &#34;Slow suicide's no way to go/Wake up, young man, you've got to wake up..&#34;The songs written by McCready and Barret Martin are equally beautiful. &#34;X-Ray Mind&#34; sounds like a transmission from, well, Mars.Oh the laughs die whenOne such as I runAnd allow myselfTime for own true needsWhen convincing meThat you're on my teamMay not lie to meBut not mentioningSo sit back and haveAn hystericalLaugh at tiny holesBuy and trade men's soulsX-ray mind reads plentyWorth no more than penniesBeing an Alice In Chains fan I was surprised to notice that I liked hearing Staley sing without anyone else overdubbing or accompanying him all the time. He had a one of a kind mix of the swampish Seattle sound and a deep baritone that could kick the song into overdrive if need be.Hearing this and watching the performances I remembered that Jerry Cantrell from AIC had replaced Staley with William Duvall, a nice guy who also can sing fairly well. Question: why? He talks about how he feels really &#34;picked on&#34; by the public about it and he feels he should be able to &#34;just play music&#34;. Of course. Just change the name, as band names especially have meaning. It's one thing if people are &#34;picking&#34; on you for sh*tty reasons, and another if it's a legitimate one.I've never seen the kind of lack of respect toward a lead singer's memory as I've seen from Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney. And let's not forget Mike Starr, one of the original guitarists being dead too! So it's hardly unreasonable to expect at least an amending of the band's name.It's really a shame. When Staley died (as people really seemed to see coming) everyone sort of laughed about it. People said roadies bet on when he would die, that his arms had fallen off, all kinds of grisly nonsense. Because his drug use had become so horrific, people felt they had the right to just laugh and not give him the respect that Kurt Cobain must have gotten, or Eddie Vedder has. His band kind of laughed at him too, by doing what they are doing right now.But money plays a part in this as well.Anyway, to get back to the matter at hand; this is one of the best alchemical explosions of music I've ever heard.

Flings is a commanding work of fiction that captures the contemporary search for identity, connection, and a place to call home.These are basically tales about unmet expectations.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,1,Odd,Michael Ross, the subject of Martha Elliot's hybrid memoir/&#34;I'll remember you&#34; tale of friendship with a death row inmate, was convicted of raping and murdering 8 women from 1981 - 1984. These included adolescent girls.Martha Elliot befriended (if the reader is content to believe that friendship was all that was going on here) Michael Ross during her prestigious career as a journalist. While writing for the Tribune she decided to interview Ross about his guilt or innocence. For some odd reason, the interview had to be in person rather on the phone.The two hit it off famously, and a budding friendship began. She began to study his life. A victim of psychological abuse by his mother, he began his career of raping and murdering women in college, even though he had plenty of girlfriends.My problem with the book comes down, really, to the believability of Ross' motives when interacting with Elliot, and her almost complete lack of skepticism regarding them.She behaved almost as if she were his secretary, advocate, and something else? all at once. So eager indeed was she to help Ross that she delivered documents and newspapers to him on a daily basis, and would immediately call him back to read to him from whatever book or article he was curious about. Miss Elliot is a celebrated journalist for good reason and I don't intend to take any cheap shots, but not once in the entirety of this challenging text do you really get the sense that she's even raised that important question: am I being manipulated by a psychopathic rapist/murderer?We hear about his hormone therapy, his struggles in court, his willingness to &#34;surrender his life&#34; and accept the death penalty to &#34;satisfy the needs of the victims&#34;. Of course, paragraphs before, she recounts from letters he wrote which describe prison life as not worth enduring, or death being better. He writes a lot about his suffering and displays a sort of disturbing, superficial chivalry, urging Elliot to take &#34;the safest flights&#34; to come see him, and appearing to always have his victims in mind. (In an &#34;altruistic&#34; way, of course.)And of course with this book a prominent journalist has a sort of &#34;In Cold Blood&#34;, new, exciting release and a murderer had some more free time while being in prison. Both parties benefited.This tries to be &#34;Dead Man Walking&#34; but it isn't. I am an opponent of the death penalty and realize that prisoners need advocates, even the most repugnant ones. I just don't think that's what was going on here.This could be a good textbook for an Abnormal Psych class.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,March 27, 2015,159420490X,The Man in the Monster: An Intimate Portrait of a Serial Killer,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420490X,Penguin Press,$18.98
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Heart-rending,One does not have to be a hipster or even, necessarily, a huge music fan to appreciate the work of Daniel Johnston. I myself watch TV, have never been to Seattle, and enjoy a few Guns N Roses songs.Johnston is a singular figure in music or any other field, obviously, but the music itself is what counts, and there is something to it. A childlike ambience and lyrical superfluity combine to form a pleasantly heartbreaking (sometimes deranged) experience.&#34;It's Over&#34;, &#34;I'm a Baby (In My Universe)&#34;, &#34;Running Water&#34;, and &#34;Desperate Man Blues&#34; are a little like hearing a small child with a lifetime of musical experience working a toy piano in some archaic cathedral.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Makes "Black Swan" look like Mary Poppins,&#34;Starry Eyes&#34; with Alexandra Essoe is a near perfect synthesis of excruciatingly good acting, poetic metaphor, and a sustained meditation on the nature of ambition and evil.First you really have to appreciate the leading lady's performance, which transcends 89 percent of the acting these days. Essoe makes her body into the vehicle for ambitious carnivorousness, decay, and a sort of awful rebirth I still fail to understand entirely.Essoe plays Sarah, a nice girl who works at a restaurant with a nice boss while pursuing an acting career. She lives with a bunch of competitive but basically nice college roommates who also aspire towards cinematic glory, just not with her inhuman fervor.She is called into an audition by &#34;Silver Screams&#34;, an old horror studio that needs new blood. During Sarah's audition, she has a genuine reaction to her inner tension which fascinates the company's talent scouts. Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer make the viewer complicit in Sarah's moral decay, flashing a camera light which forces you to look deeper and farther as she suffers through two spiritual neuterings.While I usually hate gore in movies, the transition of Sarah from nice girl to monster wouldn't have been convincing without it--and boy, is it convincing. This was better than &#34;House of the Devil&#34;, better than the &#34;Babadook&#34;, just the most disturbing film I've seen in the genre.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Very thought provoking,Adam Benforado is is a professor, writer, lawyer, and legal scholar. You can tell, because this book explores the grievous failings of the legal system (and it's spectators) with a thoroughness and worn, wise sensibility that one rarely finds in writers of any field.This is a disturbing book because it brings the reader's prejudices into the forefront. Most of us, as people who maybe served on a jury and watched a lot of Law and Order, have never had to look at a defendant with any degree of impartiality or been in the most inconvenient position of having to judge a life and death situation and choose sides.Benforado points, of course, to our preconceptions and prejudices when looking at a criminal--particularly those who commit heinous crimes. And to the fact that people of societal status--which should be meaningless in a courtroom--will do 1 year for an offense that will be considered almost capital for a person of different race or economic status (the cruel fate of journalist David Rosenbaumhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosenbaum_(journalist) is offered as a perfect example.The only thing I didn't like about the book was Benforado's attempt at a certain cognitive relativism as a replacement for actual values.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,4,Good,Maud Casey's narrative is appropriately compassionate, I think, for the subject matter: a young man who has very little continuity in his mental life and who, quite literally, just ups and leaves some very important life situations (his post in the military, for one) and then wanders into another one he can't deal with. I'd seen scenarios like this on Unsolved Mysteries--people with amnesia and what not, and in some books by Sacks--but she really makes it come to life.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,1,A certain bias clouds the text.,Bryan Burrough, from what I've read, was a consultant for the &#34;Dallas Morning Journal&#34; and &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; and a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. With the way he treats the cultural phenomenon of radical vs. police violence in the 1970's ( it was just insanity with no external cause and we can shake our head in wonderment and sanctimony about it) I'm kind of surprised at his accolades.Given that he seems to know his material to a meticulous point, this makes his doe-eyed routine--&#34;how could this happen?!&#34;--even more offensive. Tale after tale of the Black Liberation Army and the FBI, the Weathermen, and the even the Symbionese Liberation Army are squeezed and rinsed till Mr. Burrough can be satisfied.Burrough relies on the current worship of cop and military culture to excuse police brutality, government surveillance, and the institutional thuggery which led to the demise of one of the most significant cultural rebellions in our time. I was hoping for a balanced perspective and therefore to enjoy the extensive research; others may, I'm sure, but I call *latent fascist* on this book.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,February 28, 2015,1594204292,Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594204292,Penguin Press,$20.36
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,"This lonely hill",Mario Martone's &#34;Il giovane favoloso&#34; will endure as the definitive biopic of Giacomo Leopardi, Italian poet and philosopher.Hailing from Recanati, Italy, where he spent most of his shamed, unhappy life, Leopardi had a pronounced hump in his back and a deformity in his bones. Also an essayist and noted philologist, his &#34;philosophy&#34; on human existence will never be popular. I vaguely recall the translator (or author) of &#34;The Giacomo Leopardi Reader&#34; (now entirely unnecessary as the Canti and the Zibaldone have been translated) stating: &#34;It is not Leopardi'swork that is depressing: it is his life.&#34; His work is mind bogglingly transcendent poetically, but I think that's a nice half-truth. His work is gorgeously depressing.Elio Germano does an Oscar turn as the sickly poet. I imagine it must have been pretty uncomfortable having to wear whatever prop was given as his hump during such intense scenes, which in turn sort of drives home how uncomfortable Leopardi's life must itself have been.Leopardi started out life as nobility, and in this sense you're watching a movie about the poor, poor lot of independently wealthy Italians during times of horrible poverty; but to him it was natural, and his domineering father ruled over everything he read, did, and wrote. He did not want him to leave Recanati.The sense of enforced seclusion, his sickliness as an adolescent and his escape into erudition are palpable in his work and equally so in this film. He is constantly ashamed before himself, and is just generally unpopular anywhere; indeed, the more praise he receives for his literary endeavors, the stranger he is to his family and friends. The unabashed pessimism of his work and his central ideas of the permanent insolubility of human suffering were certainly not popular in his time, or in any time, though the magic and power of cosmic pessimism seem a bit diluted these days because more people are into it. Leopardi would have a good (or better) time now. He didn't have a good time.His sense of nature as ephemeral and cruel, a beautiful tapestry constructed from barbs of &#34;noia&#34; dogs him. His sense of the feminine as incorruptible, sacrosanct, and not under any circumstances to be tampered with in any way betray the actual and lasting effect his background had on him. Early on in life he falls in love with a women and she dies spontaneously.The film frankly shows what his biographers hint at: that, because of his physical deformity, the women he imagined he was having romances were not sharing those feelings. Leopardi beat so hard against his cage, it would seem, that it only suffocated him more and even his travels left him with no consolation. He would die in Recanati, returning to his roots.The film suggests that one can never tell if Leopardi meant what he was saying or not. He enjoyed messing with people because they treated him with such contempt, but even especially after watching this detailed recounting of his life I think he really did. The Zibaldone--which is so enormous as to be the equivalent of a 25 pound weight--is certainly proof of a disciplined conviction. Leopardi believed, as his character whispers to his brother in the film as a youth, that &#34;doubt was the root of knowledge&#34;.There should be more *well made* movies about poets.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,We have seen the enemy,Wheatley's &#34;Kill List&#34; is a cruel, scary film. Not the scariest I've ever seen, but still excellent.Two vets of some nonspecific conflicts are poor and decide to supplement their income by taking up some free lance work; carrying out hits for a particularly odd local eccentric.Jay (Neil Maskell) and Gal (Michael Smiley) turn in some great performances as guys who aren't foreign to chaos. Jay is having trouble meeting his wife's financial expectations, and his son Sam suffers from their constant arguments. His friend finally convinces Jay to become a hit man. His wife's friend leaves a strange mark on their mirror.As things get more and more brutal, it becomes clear to both of them that something more sinister is going on. The end is, eh, hard to take.Extremely well done.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Thick noir,&#34;Deep Cover&#34; is one of the most excrutiatingly honest portrayals of &#34;The War on Drugs&#34; that I've seen. Indeed, the intensity and accuracy of this movie is at times disconcerting and a bit disillusioning, which I suspect is why it never had a huge fan base. In the tradition of &#34;Sugar Hill&#34; or some of the other raw portraits of urban life in the 90's, Lawrence Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum's performances are so mint that the movie's excesses are all believable. More than anything else, this shows how one culture poisons another and every race eventually gets involved in the general garbage, handshaking, and corruption. And it doesn't get much more direct in that arena than narcotics dealing and use.Lawrence Fishburne plays Russell Stevens Jr., a puritanical beat cop who is pulled in by DEA agent played by the impeccably nerdy Charles Martin Smith. Since Fishburne's character saw his father shot by a storeowner on Christmas as a child, he is very inhibited; Smith's characters urges him to use his repressed vices in the undercover world.And he does so very successfully, slowly turning into a monster who doesn't mind filling his own people's communities with dope, and executing his rival drug dealer (who looks exactly like MC Hammer) in a bathroom, clearly becoming aroused from the execution. His partner in crime, David, played by Goldblum, is a successful businessman who simply enjoys being a drug dealer in his spare time, helps him grow accustomed to the bowels of the drug world.David is abused by a Serbian drug dealer constantly at their meetings; juvenile slaps in the mouth take precedence over multi million dollar drug deals. Really, why else be a criminal if you can't be a total scumbag? David is proud of his Jewish heritage, and lives by the motto &#34;Never Again&#34;: very soon the Serb finds himself executed. You don't get the sense that Fishburne's character objects all that much. The amusing thing: this is the kind of bullish*t the DEA's watching. This nonsense.David begins wearing a big black leather trench coat and corrupting Fishburne's character more and more. Fishburne is torn between his loyalty to David and a saintly Christian cop played by Clarence Williams III. The scene in which he confesses to David that he's a cop is epic. In the end, it's nice to watch the movie and imagine that if Fishburne's character had filmed the dirty interactions between cops and a Noriega figure in the film, it would change the world; things like this are revealed everyday and nothing happens. A great film that deserves a re-release.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,August 9, 2015,6305505802,Deep Cover,Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305505802,New Line Home Video,$39.99
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,An elegant translation of Camus' masterpiece,Director. Luchino Visconti's film version of Camus' famous novel is excellent. As much as it is possible to really capture Camus (his prose, when you really read it, seems too uncanny and slippery for that), this movie does it.Marcello Mastroianni plays Mersault with a quiet, intense grace and dignity that makes the rest of the world seem foolish, not his seeming disconnection from it or any kind of derealization. I think Camus himself would have liked it, especially the beach scene where he fires those fateful shots, but who knows? It's also an amusing movie in the sense that we see outside of the protagonist (does anyone think of him as a total anti-hero anymore?) and his environment. The scene in the cell with his priest is *perfect*, and Mastroanni looks exactly like Camus.Dreamlike and elegant.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Great movie,Why is that so often successful, &#34;popular&#34; kids end up in the newspapers for horrendous crimes? Why do we feel the need to invent thematic tragedies where only one or two deranged people are at fault? David Morse's film &#34;The Boy&#34;, about a 9 year old named Ted, is a sustained meditation on this subject.This film is remarkable because it doesn't try to do anything but relate a few days in the life of a young boy who is already a murderer. He is the dark seed waiting to spring on society, but there's no menace or style to the film. Even highly unconventional films have a &#34;style&#34;--found footage, independent, they all have their cinematography and a calling card. &#34;The Boy&#34; is absolute realism with none of these.Ted lives with his father (played in a low key by David Morse) in a run down motel. Probably unwisely, he tries to give Ted something to do by telling him that if he cleans dead animals off the road he'll give him some money. Ted takes this seriously. When animals don't show up, they appear, one a bunny Ted appreciates as appealing, but is as nothing compared to his higher purpose.His father tries to throw a birthday party for Ted with a song he and his absentee mother (now supposedly in Florida, a piece of information very important to Ted) used to listen to. Ted plugs his ears and kicks things, running away. Eventually we find that Ted has her address on a postcard, and intends to get there by hook or by crook.As a result of a dead deer in the road, a very strange man with a bump on his head arrives at the motel. He's questioned by the very strange sherrif about what he's doing in town without result. He tells Ted his wife &#34;died in a fire&#34;. Ted finds his weakness quickly: a box with his wife's ashes in it.However strange or odd this guy might be, you can bet he'll do less harm to society than Ted himself.David Morse's character is a working man, well intentioned, and completely ignorant of what Ted already is. He thinks Ted will inherit the motel, but does suspect he's cynical about it. Ted plays happy music and experiments with different facial expressions alone in the motel rooms, gearing himself up for something. He spends a lot of time in a rainy junkyard filled with sharp metal tools. This is what he knows.Ted has no internet or TV. He doesn't have any cues as to how he's supposed to act, and this makes the film unique.The stranger makes the mistake of breaking a travel promise to Ted after acting like his best buddy. Ted says calmly and with absolute conviction, &#34;Your wife is nothing but a pile of dirt&#34;. In a rage he chases Ted to the junkyard because he has assessed accurately that people become enraged when you say things of that nature.In short, one insult too many happen to Ted in too quick a time. They are real and severe. But Ted decides to take it to the 1 percent, a group of rich teenagers who treat him like sh*t, in a way most 9 year olds most assuredly wouldn't. However, this film is set in 1989, and children weren't sized up psychologically the same way they might be now.This movie is extremely unique. Felt kinda weird watching a 9 year old for almost two hours, but Ted isn't really a kid. There is no blame in this film. Ted's just ted.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Right on time,Daryl Cunningham is first and foremost a great cartoonist. Nothing he draws fails to make an impression.Having the bias of knowing the author (virtually) Randians will no doubt be suspicious in advance: he's a nice guy concerned with social causes. Which is probably why he decided to take less of a payday and pen this noble little treat on where &#34;the celebration of the self&#34; has led us: to playing with imaginary money, defunding every charitable organization known to man *at a higher level than the Reagan era*, and finally in 2008 coming real close to losing everything everyone had, whether they happened to be Santa's Helpers or have-fun-because-the-void-is-approaching nihilists dressed in all kinds of garbs.Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum (Rand's real name) was not the exemplar of her git-it-done values, and her philosophy is unrealizable because it is the fantasy world of someone who lived from the generosity of others while delivering the gospel of self sufficiency to others. (Though it's been oft repeated and ignored by her followers, Miss Rosenbaum gobbled all the SSI she could when she finally got cancer from smoking.)Only what is lived can be conveyed in real art, as Darryl Cunningham delivers it.The most successful countries on Earth do not just fund defense, police and the courts, as Rand would have it. They invest in research, education and innovation. They provide a safety net to the sick and needy. They keep defense spending in check. They protect the environment from over-exploitation. They make cuts and raise taxes, so that societys costs and benefits are shared. The most successful country on earth would not have had a 2008.Darryl drops a hint that now things are sort of turning around in a boomerang of attitude. News and TV anchors have to continually remind politicians that the people at large are getting sick of this demented &#34;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&#34; philosophy. The 1 percent are hated.To expose Miss Rosenbaum or Rand or whatever as what she was, he used some excellent sources Objectivists have strenuously Objected to (because they are *real* sources).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,June 11, 2015,1419715984,The Age of Selfishness: Ayn Rand, Morality, and the Financial Crisis,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419715984,Harry N.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Remarkable,Eric Basso's &#34;Revagations: A Book of Dreams&#34; is a work first and foremost of smothering erudition; his introduction chronicles the so called &#34;dream lives&#34; of Coleridge, Victor Hugo, and Paul Valery. The kind of tidbits in the intro are worth the price of admission, in my opinion. Hugo really could have been a symbolist.The author's own dreams are equally as fascinating. Possessing a sense of the urbane, cinema's childlike fantasy and immanent catastrophe, here's one that stood out for me: Winning I'm filling in the triangular area of an abstract drawing with black crayon on a landing in the parochial school to which I've been sent, against my will, for summer instruction. They have eliminated all the steps. One must slide down this chute standing up. My feet pass over the photoelectric cells that keep you on course.

His primal emotional sincerity is well gloved in his mastery of technique but what shines above all is his love of surrealism and the surrealist quest.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Very good. Scary.,Charlotte Perkins Gilman's story &#34;The Yellow Wallpaper&#34; is one of the most memorable of the Gothic horror tales. While this production actually has little to do with the story as it was written, director Logan Thomas delivers a satisfying foray into the psyche that matches the effect of the tale. As it should be with full blooded gothic horror, you feel every tender nerve exposed and no neurotic stone is left unturned by the madness that follows one woman's slow descent into psychosis. The film has a touch of Poe and, as one other reviewer noted, more than a touch of Lovecraft, but with a woman's viewpoint, as with the story.Actor Michael Moriarty (early &#34;Law and Order&#34;) appears in a sort of time warp role that somehow suits him. Better than any production I've seen of this story, and the atmosphere was so thick with pathos and dystopia at one point that it reminded me of a virtually forgotten film I saw on videotape years ago: &#34;Pate&#34;.

Breton put a poem of his, which is pretty good, in &#34;An Anthology of Black Humor&#34;. His libertinism inspired the group. He scandalized French society with his scandalousness.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Great gift for your mom,I ordered these for my mom because I instantly knew when seeing them offered that this was a &#34;mom gift&#34;. She is very pleased and has described to me in enthusiastic detail.All have handles that are comfortable to grip. The seams are barely noticeable and do not interfere with your grip. The handles flex. The slotted turner held a 20 oz. can of soup with no noticeable change in the angle of the handle.The spoon holds two tablespoons of water or whatever liquid. You can scoop 1/5 and a half cups of pasta with spaghetti spoons. The actual amount may depend on how deft you are loading, lifting the material onto the spaghetti spoon. The spoon is excellent.I got the red set to send out.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,The Hunter S. Thompson of Catholicism,The new novel by William Hjortsberg (of "Falling Angel" fame) places the reader in a Chandleresque blender of frayed counterculture, murder, and a tortured search a lost girlfriend in LA. Hjorstberg is an unusual talent; he has the perverse purity of an O'Connor or Graham Greene, but he comes at salvation from a darker place.This tale of broken lives, secondhand gangsters and loser-wannabe-criminals, demented hippies and the rise of a black sun over the 60's counterculture is as highly charged as his debut novel. Ending is a surprise, too.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,First rate,Whatever one thinks of Ligotti's &#34;philosophy&#34; as espoused in the unforgettable &#34;Conspiracy Against The Human Race&#34;, there is no arguing with his fiction. I've been with his material for so long that it almost seems indecent for Penguin to distribute him, but I'm also happy.Along with &#34;Notes On the Writing of Horror&#34;, &#34;Professor Nobody's Lecture&#34; and a few other more personal asides and theorems on the origin of horror, we have &#34;Grimscribe&#34;, &#34;The Last Feast of Harlequin&#34;, and, of course, &#34;The Frolic&#34;, which all these years later I still find to be the proper introduction to Ligotti's absolutely dystopian, hopeless imaginative universe.There is something of the black priest in Ligotti, the lapsed Catholic running around with a set of fangs, circling his tail around the template of human meaning while peering into something else, some blacker sphere descending from our very pores: the stink of oblivion. A certain snobbery always emerges from the &#34;critical&#34; crowd regarding weird fiction which cannot apply to Ligotti's writing. It is literary and anti literary, partaking of everything and nothing all at once. There is an equal amount of Thomas Bernhard and HP Lovecraft here. Jeff Vandermeer gives a fantastic introduction reflecting a knowledge of the costs Ligotti's fiction (and non-fiction) exacts from the reader. Paradoxically, this is a joy!

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Beautifully fictionalized account of Woolf's life,Norah Vincent hit the proverbial nail in Woolf's coffin with this book, which beautifully reimagines the Bloomsbury Group, T.S. Eliot, her husband Leonard, and W.B. Yeats. I particularly enjoyed her depiction of Yeats as a sedate and powerful mystic, and Virginia Woolf as a hyper imaginative and extremely disturbed Magellan of the mind, ultimately finding her end with the impossibility of a free consciousness.Some imaginative accounts fall flat, others don't, usually because the author either is or isn't carrying the imaginative thread of the subject properly.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,4,Approaching greatness,I should begin this review with a disclaimer: I am underwhelmed by Del Toro and this movie was my date's pick, not mine. His poetic imagery in film often approaches greatness but falters because of this glossy fantasy element he chooses to employ that I can only call sentimental. It can be corny. That said, I enjoyed this movie and found it much better than Kronos.In turn of the century New York, a young girl named Edith (Sofia Wells), the seven-year-old daughter of Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), a wealthy Buffalo businessman, is visited by the ghost of her recently deceased mother. The ghastly apparition whispers the warning &#34;Beware of Crimson Peak.&#34; The deeply frightened girl has no idea what the warning means and the ghost does not return.However, after the violent death of her father, she decides to do exactly that. Move to Crimson Peak, a foreboding manor with the non industrious Thomas Sharpe (played by Tom Hiddleston in an icy, distant, disturbed and believable performance). And here comes the kicker: Jessica Chastain as Lucille Sharpe, the secret of the family, and for good reason. I loved her performance and was so drawn to her that even with some displeasing revelations to say the very least wanted her to be better off at the end than she was.This is all a metaphor for family, stagnation, and the lies we will tell and live in just to keep things calm. What I liked was Del Toro pushing the darkness to the extreme, something he rarely does in his other films. Just a few degrees to the left or right and this movie would have been a Poe-esque classic. Still, missing this would be missing a rare, rare film experience.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,"True friends are always together in spirit." ---Lucy Maud Montgomery,Levan Gabriadze beat all his contemporaries to the punch, and did so with a sadistic flair that only a true director of the macabre could get away with.Basically (and with the other reviewer I would absolutely recommend watching this on a computer) a circle of friends are revealed to be what they are behind their facades. For all the screaming and adolescent posturing, this is a genuine morality play with virtual/supernatural judge presiding every second.A girl (and this is something that happens everyday) is cyberbullied and caught in a most unladylike pose on camera. As a result, she kills herself (also on camera). None of this is particularly subtle until the ever sadistic Gabriadze does exactly what the situation calls for: shows each at his or her moral core. The entity is not unsparing in it's vengeance, and all it is doing is using the terrain of virtual reality we use everyday.This is also a chilling commentary on how cavalier we are with things like Facebook and technology, and how our secrets will dethrone us eventually.The negative reviewers haven't seen to many horror movies if they hate this one so bad. It's mostly subtle and masterful. What to avoid: all the sequels.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,August 29, 2015,B00WF9XP9W,Unfriended (Blu-ray + DVD + DIGITAL HD with UltraViolet),Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WF9XP9W,Universal Studios,$14.99

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,An authentic surrealist,Charles Henri Ford is a too often neglected surrealist poet. Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi,[citation needed] he dropped out of high school and by age 16 he had started his first magazine, Blues(subtitled &#34;A Bisexual Bimonthly&#34;). Actress Ruth Ford (19112009) was his sister and only known sibling.Not long after, he became part of Gertrude Stein's salon in Paris, where he met Natalie Barney, Man Ray, Kay Boyle, Janet Flanner, Peggy Guggenheim, Djuna Barnes (with whom he had an affair and travelled to Tangiers) and others of the American expatriate community in Montparnasse and Saint-Germain-des-Pr&egrave;s. He went to Morocco in 1932 at the suggestion of Paul Bowles, and there he typed Barnes' just-completed novel, Nightwood (1936), for her.With Parker Tyler, who would later become a highly respected film critic, he co-authored The Young and Evil (1933), an energetically experimental novel with obvious debts to fellow writer Djuna Barnes, and also to Gertrude Stein, who called it &#34;the novel that beat the Beat Generation by a generation&#34;. The novel portrays a collection of young genderqueer artists as they write poems, have sex, move in and out of cheap rented rooms, and duck into the neighborhood's many speakeasies. The characters' gender and sexual identities are presented candidly; it was this candor which was reportedly the reason for its rejection by several American and British publishers. It was finally picked up by Obelisk Press in Paris.Ford returned to New York City in 1934 and brought Pavel Tchelitchew (Ford's life partner until the latter's death in 1957) with him. Ford's circle at the time included Carl Van Vechten, Glenway Wescott, George Platt Lynes, Lincoln Kirstein, Orson Welles, George Balanchine, and E. E. Cummings. Visiting friends from abroad included Cecil Beaton, Leonor Fini, George Hoyningen-Huene, and Salvador Dal&iacute;. Ford was photographed by Beaton in a costume designed by Dal&iacute; for Vogue in 1937.He published his first full-length book of poems, The Garden of Disorder in 1938. William Carlos Williams wrote the introduction.[2] When Ford discussed the concept of poetry, he highlighted its relationship with other forms of art, mentioning Jean Cocteau, who wrote the foreword to one of Ford's catalogs of paintings and drawings. Ford said, &#34;Everything is related to the concept of poetry. As you know, Jean Cocteau used to talk about the poetry of the novel, the poetry of the essay, the poetry of the theatereverything he did, he said, was poetry. Well, he was one of my gurus.&#34; In 1940, Ford and Tyler collaborated again on the magazine View, which was mainly concerned with avant-garde and surrealist art. It was published quarterly, as finances permitted, until 1947. It attracted contributions from such artists as Tchelitchew, Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Andr&eacute; Masson, Pablo Picasso, Henry Miller, Paul Klee, Albert Camus, Lawrence Durrell, Georgia O'Keeffe, Man Ray, Jorge Luis Borges, Joan Mir&oacute;, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jean Genet, Ren&eacute; Magritte, Jean Dubuffet, and Edouard Roditi.Ford was far more than a high named associate, however; his poems cut to the heart of surrealism, even if he could have used an editor.PLAINTBefore a mob of 10,000 at Owensboro, KYI, Rainey Betha, 22from the top-branch of race -hatred look at you.My limbs are bound, though boundless the bright sunlike my bright blood which had to runinto the orchard that excluded me:now I climb death's tree.The pruning hooks of many mouthscut the black-leaved boughs.The robins of my eyes hover wheresixteen leaves fall that were a prayer:sixteen mouths are open wide;the minutes like black cherriesdrop from my shady side.Oh, who is the forester must tend such a tree, Lord?Do angels pick the cherry-blood of folk like me, Lord?ST-JOHN PERSEHolding habit shaped memories in a leopard-skin apronThe bone of your left ear vibrating to stars of deep seasSt-John Perse prisoner on a lost planetYou dreamed of other existencesHad it been the wandering spirit of a jungle fighterWho entrusted you with theignitionkey to the wheel of truthYou may have discarded the ten causes of regretBut you were a sky-goerAndpaid homage toa dragoned-headed moonInstalled on the lion-throneAt the cremation grounds where, cotton-clad, we attended your last ritesGods of the world of formlessnessWhere there to participate in the mystic dramaIn your ashes I sensed no cessation of thoughtYour meanings, apparitional and boundless, added up to the sacred number 7,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,July 23, 2015,0872862518,Out of the Labyrinth: Selected Poems,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872862518,City Lights Publishers,$3.99

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,2,Worn out?,I really liked the novella better, I have to say. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins do a fantastic job of playing two men in prison, and the warden Bob Gunton does one of the best portrayals of Satan I've ever seen. (He's even worse in the novella.)The thing is that I've seen this SO MANY TIMES over the years (and therefore had more time to think about it) that I can barely stomach seeing it on television, let alone going out of my way to watch it on Netlix or what have you. What I find striking is that we never see the victims of these men who are decidedly *not* innocent.We never see their families, or the irremediably stolen and wrecked lives they've produced. Take the two scumbags who managed to break out of prison awhile ago. One had killed his boss and dismembered him because he didn't care for him; chopped him up like raw meat and dumped him somewhere. The other shot a cop when he pulled him over, probably because he was wanted. And yet in a fit of absolute fantasy, everyone associated those two scumbags with Freeman and Robbins.For some odd reason, when I watch the movie now I don't focus so much on the sympathetic characters (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman). I focus more on the other guys surrounding them and wonder: &#34;What the f**k did they do?

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,The presence of absence,I personally don't enjoy reading memoirs because of the impulse people naturally have to idealize their own memories, or worse, exploit their memories to avenge real or imagined grudges in life. It's difficult for a memoir to stick out these days for precisely these reasons.Lucas Mann wrote this with the obvious intention of being honest and not providing the reader with any feel good endings, or anything like that.His older brother Josh died of a heroin overdose when he was 13. He works through the memories of this by turns disturbed, grandiose, malicious and destructive individual, using Josh's &#34;diary&#34; to try to piece an ephemeral and thoroughly wasted life together. Josh was even such a nice guy that during his last period of self destruction he had the Iron Cross tattooed on his ankle. Probably, Lucas realizes at the funeral, to make sure that everyone attending would *definitely* have nothing good to say about him. His relationship with Mann is disconnected and yet somehow intense. It reads like what it ultimately is: a slow abandonment, a quiet betrayal even Josh doesn't understand. It's kind of hard to figure out who Josh really was, but he didn't live long enough for anything solid to form.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,That pesky inner critic.,Guy De Maupassant's diaristic short story &#34;The Horla&#34; has always been one of my favorite horror stories, if it can be quite called horror (it lacks a supernatural element, or does it? one never does entirely find out). In &#34;Diary of a Madman&#34; Vincent Price and company come very close to nailing down the tormented, disorganized, and eventually blood curdingly insane state of the narrator. Instead of suggestion--which in all honesty may have worked a bit better at times--we see a blue orb form over the eyes of the man Price's magistrate condemns to death. He speaks of a supernatural force which forced him to take his wife's life and via the blue Price's self righteous prig becomes a believer. That's just the thing, though: this guy has been studying the criminal mind for so long that is all this a hallucination?Practically speaking, it doesn't matter too much. Soon Price is out with his butcher knife, doing &#34;The Horla's&#34; deeds in grisly fashion, though you have to admit one incident is rather gratifying considering the individual disposed of. Price's dead wife makes his life lack salsa, and an unwise recommendation from an analyst plunges him into the world of artistic society. Little does said analyst know that Vincent is actively engaging voices all night, and keeping wax sculptures of his deceased lovely in his drawing room while watching the windows open and close.I must say that while I thoroughly enjoyed the ending, the sheer unpleasantness of the story cannot be driven home with any consolation. Maupassant himself penned the story while ill with syphillis and came to believe a &#34;horla&#34; was haunting him, or some unseen presence. The story is one of mental mayhem, wholly unaffected. Still, this is the best film version I've seen of it, and is another example of Vincent Price acting superbly in a psychologically demanding film. If you like this, check out &#34;The Last Man On Earth&#34;, *the* best film version of Richard Matheson's &#34;I Am Legend&#34;.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,July 4, 2015,B004LB5FAY,Diary Of A Madman,Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LB5FAY,MGM,$13.99
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,4,That costly glory,When I first listened to &#34;Hi, How Are You?&#34; in an FYE music sampling machine vendor I knew that Daniel Johnston's story would be something like this. But not this bad.Johnston was known, I guess, before Kurt Cobain wore the t-shirt of the above mentioned album at one of the MTV music awards. Known wouldn't be quite the right word: infamous and pitied would be much better. Some of the stories related are funny at first, and then when you reflect on them, they become very sad. Like when the members of Sonic Youth had to chase him from a gig because he was high on LSD, believing that he had discovered a new supernatural realm, cautioning them not to under any circumstances call his parents. Or when he ripped the key out of the ignition of his father's private jet and threw it out the window, just barely crashing in a safe manner because of his father's training. (He thought he was Casper the Friendly Ghost.)Less humorous even in this specious vein is when Daniel, psychotically high on marijuana (he shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near the music scene) beat his manager bloody with a lead pipe to &#34;cast his demons out&#34; and then dropped the other manager who had devoted most of his life to him.The Bible Belt can really mess some people up, but it and a palette of mental disturbances did a number on Daniel Johnston (he of course has the requisite talent to form all that bitterness into something worthwhile). But does it really matter? Even with his cult fame? Who knows.Some of this was extraordinary, some of it was kind of &#34;let's laugh at the maniac&#34; pornography. Anyone who listens to his music can't doubt, though, that he unearthed a new vein in sound.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Nothing Is Ever Deleted,Joseph M. Reagle Jr. obviously put quite a bit of time into amassing a deceptively slim but massive text on the bizarre, funny, and disturbing ways our increased access to all manner of technological opinionation has enhanced our cultural reflection, refining it in both innovative and cartoonish ways.Here he focuses on the &#34;comment culture&#34; ultra cyberspace has engendered. Anyone anywhere can indulge in the basest or loftiest of opinions about anything at any time and it is public domain in a nanosecond. The beginnings aren't all that surprising.&#34;In 1966, twenty eight year old Stewart Brand was at the beach, tripping on LSD and gazing at San Francisco's skyline, when he noted the slight curve of the horizon and mused that if he ascended, the curve of the earth would become more pronounced until he saw the whole of the earth. Such a perspective could be the jolt that people needed to appreciate that planet Earth was &#34;complete, thing, adrift.&#34; After gaining this insight, people would never &#34;perceive things the same way&#34; and would get on with the business of &#34;getting civilization right.&#34; Given the frenzied activity of NASA and the Soviets, why had we not seen a picture of the earth yet? The next morning he began printing buttons and posters with that very question. A couple years later, theApollo 8 moon mission delivered the photography, and Brand's &#34;Whole Earth Catalog, published regularly between 1968 and 1972 and intermittently thereafter, featured the image of the blue and green marble on its cover. Working as a biologist at Stanford University while organizing the Trips Rock Festival, he took careful note of who &#34;liked what&#34; at these concerts, what they bought, and his magazines were occasionally edited by &#34;Wired&#34; magazine editor Kevin Kelly who consistently made notes that &#34;we are as gods whether we want to be or not&#34; was an excellent technological sales slogan.&#34;This really weird tying of the 60's counterculture lingo to the corporate world now isn't a huge shock, since it consisted of so much fantastique sci-fi semantic--codes, the loss of context and the inability of almost 89 percent of the population to really and truly tell the difference between reality and virtual reality is what is bothersome. He talks about the evolution of even ancient lingo like &#34;LOL&#34;, or the new and sexy ones like &#34;FTWWTF&#34;. Comments--even the most common--are alarmingly revelatory of our biases. If the phrase &#34;letting it all hang out&#34; ever had a meaning, it certainly has one now.&#34;People found this 4/5 review to be a perplexing example of the inscrutableness of others. One commenter quipped that &#34;some people are just impossible to please. Is this the case?&#34; And is it even a genuine review?After some searching, I found that it was indeed areal review on a Canadian houseware site by user KayBe:This morning my son called me at work to tell me the alarm was going off..I called my husband (who luckily was not far away) and he headed home. He checked our furnace....and discovered the burner was &#34;cartooned up&#34; so it wasn't burning properly..If he hadn't caught it and cleaned it the CO would have built up and our son might not have woken up in time. Scary thing to have happen but so glad this unit did it's job!&#34;(Anyone who has had access to dial up since 1998 or so or even before is almost certainly lying if they claim they haven't said and done offensive things online. Either that or they are just very admirable people.)And he asks a good question: when we talk about combatting sexism and homophobia and transaphobia everywhere, are we being honest when we provide the practitioners of this kind of thing the almost absolute anonymity and power to do so? I was recently on a YouTube site that featured the later work of a well known band called Alice In Chains. A girl said she would die to meet Layne Staley and something a little sexual, and a guy responded by saying: &#34;you're such a slut but i'd still pee in your butt.&#34;That comment is just about as vile as it gets and it got more than a few likes. And people encouraged to kill themselves over and over and over; not that should effect a mature person who knows the difference between reality and online fantasy, but those distinctions are becoming less and less recognized. What is a bully now? What is a troll? These are all concerns nailed down very very well in this book, which I would recommend to any thinking person.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,June 28, 2015,026202893X,Reading the Comments: Likers, Haters, and Manipulators at the Bottom of the Web,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026202893X,The MIT Press,$20.48

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,War is Good For Nothing,Particularly after seeing this masterful indie movie I will never understand why anyone joins the army.The young woman portrayed by Tajana Prka who plays a traumatized female veteran clearly suffering from (PTSD), with her incredible performance made that a larger question in my mind as the movie progressed. The direction by Tarique Qayumi is superb, if occasionally erring to the unrealities of &#34;the action genre&#34; and therefore somewhat unrealistic in spots.Mattie, the shell of a soldier, is obsessed with stopping on American soil some of the uglier things she witnessed in combat. She is a zombie.There is only the obsession in her mind, like a drug fiend fixated on a substance. Her husband can't connect with her and she is alien to her kids.She has &#34;the thousand yard stare&#34; in spades.

Five flexible blades individually adjust to the contours of the skin delivering an ultra-close shave. The razors head pivots 40° enhancing shave control even more.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,One of the best books I've ever read.,Celia Green (born 1935) was as skeptical as a skeptic can ever get while doubting that even skepticism is profound doubt. There is no way to exaggerate her approach. If Hume doubted the perception of a match going out, Ms. Green would have done with the whole pack in some way.Here she plunges right to the center of human existence's rumbling, fragile eye. Her definitions of &#34;sanity&#34; and &#34;insanity&#34; are a bit dense, butshe takes you where she wants you to go.&#34;Adolescents are known to think about metaphysics more than most people; thus thinking about metaphysics becomes associated with the negative concept 'immaturity'. If someone thinks about metaphysical problems at a later age, they are said to show signs of 'delayed adolescence'.&#34;&#34;It is well known that the younger people are, the less sane they are likely to be. This has led to the heavily loaded social usage of the term maturity. It iran unquestionable pro-word. Roughly speaking, the mature person is characterized by willingness to accept substitutes, compromises, and delays, particularly if these are caused by the structure of society.&#34;&#34;How does the person who is enjoying good mental health think and act?' the booklet asks, and proceeds toinformus, among other things, that 'He gets satisfaction from simple, every-day pleasures.' Freud,you see, certainly qualified.&#34;She accepts nada. Nothing. And with not the shade of a trace of an a priori, she leaves the reader in a strange zone.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Rowena!,Everyone except the most fortunate among us has experienced that most indelible of phenomena: a full blown nightmare with no commercial breaks or interruptions except the return of consciousness. Severe ones can leave you feeling completely exhausted.Hitchcock's &#34;Vertigo&#34; is as much a nightmare as David Lynch's &#34;Eraserhead&#34; or even a movie like &#34;Clean, Shaven&#34; which deliberately grovels in the tomb of the psyche to gain effect. The story actually isn't as important as the sumptuous visual feast we're treated to. Jimmy Stewart plays John &#34;Scottie&#34; Ferguson, a former police detective (who never wears a uniform, curiously enough) and is left unable to function after being responsible for the death a fellow officer. Left hanging from a roof during a chase, he becomes something of an emotional cripple as a result of this incident, unable to tolerate heights.The hypnagogic spools Hitchock uses to denote Ferguson's sensation of falling is perfect. If one has ever experienced anything like vertigo (or given considerable and detailed thought to the idea of falling from a very high place with no safeguard at the bottom) one gets a more than vicarious sensation of this from watching the film. Hitchcock using the tall buildings of 1950's San Francisco to mirror John's every move is a nasty and very effective technique in showing what he's up against (indeed, what all mortals are up against every hour of every day, whether we care to admit it or not.)Kim Novak's perfomance as Madeleine Elster/&#34;Judy&#34; is a very prescient commentary by Hitchcock on the way women are treated, often, in life and art: objects of men's desire and their pawns. The funereal remaking of Judy as Madeleine is very Poe-esque. I was continually reminded of Edgar Allan Poe's &#34;Ligeia&#34; watching this film. Perhaps it makes sense, then, that Hitchcock was doing with Kim Novak precisely what Stewart's character is guilty of doing: demanding that she forsake all other options and career pursuits for his work and the image he wanted to fashion her in.Actually, as a nasty and effective strategy, it makes a lot of sense.&#34;Never miss an opportunity to torture your audience&#34;, Hitchcock once said. Indeed. The ending is so tragic, absurd, and awful that only a torturer could have imagined it. This is indeed one of the best movies I personally have ever seen. The AFI just sets you up to be unimpressed with great works of a art.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,June 7, 2015,B0087ZG7R0,Vertigo,Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087ZG7R0,Universal Studios,$9.58

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,"You should pray to the devil more, Angel",William Hjortsberg's noir, Chandleresque hybrid of occult history (the book opens with the scattered, demented diagrams of a monk in the 16th century who made a pact with Satan) and old fashioned gumshoe detective thuggery is gut level disturbing. Clearly set in the culture of the 1980's with all of it's materialism and the slow destruction of the economy, Harry Angel is a detective hired by a successful businessman and debonaire investor to collect a debt.Angel is a hardened war veteran and private detective. At the gentle, patient prodding of his employer, Cyphre, he gets involved in the most twisted circle of cranks, psychics, ex musicians and voodoo practicing jazz musicians even the most curious mind would have trouble conjuring--Hjortsberg rises to the occasion. This book makes one want to take a shower, particularly at it's conclusion. The point: what you do not address will arrive at your doorstep: the casual evil you sow will come knocking, one way or another.I'm not surprised this was picked for a screenplay adaptation for the film &#34;Angel Heart&#34;, though the book carries a kind of William Peter Blattyesque awfulness the movie only half-manages.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,The glad bees orphan their hive, too soon and unwise.,Joshua Poteat's &#34;The Regret Histories&#34; has the coiled, unwinding quality of a slinky or an onion. You love the glint of the blade he unfolds far from you, it would seem, and then she shine of it is so close you can barely see.I'm looking for a story that will lightmy way out, a star in the sycamore's grass,taken from night and nothing and limbs cutback from the wires. It is not summer,there is no mist on the streets.The yard, vacant with ivy and nest, wears brown,and the streetlights. The sycamore is the loudest tree,its bark lifting the hard wind like the saintwho prayed to the east and failed, parchmentspread on the monastery roof. Help mespelled out in supplicant ink, roaring throughclots of frost. Look at us, late winter, pulling deadbranches from the fence at night to avoid the neighbors,poison pushed under the shed for the rats.Let's surrender all illusions of spirit, because it deceives us.The spirit is not air, even in its highest form,no matter who sparks the flame.Tonight, I suffer from not knowinghow to suffer. Tomorrow will be the same.There used to be pills to cure this affliction.Early decay, feebleness of will, Wonderful Little Liver Pills.Beef, Iron and Wine for the poorest blood, for feverof the known and unknown world.The sycamore leans its branches on the telephone lines.To hear them on the phone, those manuscripts of barkbreathing the wires, does nothing for my courage.This is how you become a saint: Translate the ruins,wherever they sleep. Bloom the tulip-tree earlyand watch bees gather in the sleet. There is no abyss,no oblivioned ocean. Just a landscape, like this one,born from a river and seven hills, bones underthe hospital cobbles, ghost rope taut in the gallows.The glad bees orphan their hive, too soon and unwise.It isn't death I want, but it isn't life, either.Mr. Poteat has worked the ore from his dreams.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Excellent acting,The story of &#34;criminologist&#34; Jason Moss who committed suicide in 2006 after starting his own Criminal Defense law firm is a particularly grimy lesson in the costs of ambition.Prior to that Moss wrote a bestselling book, &#34;The Last Victim&#34;, in which he documented his relationship with serial killers like Richard Ramirez, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Henry Lee Lucas and finally John Wayne Gacy.Being a sedentary 18 year old with the unusual goal of transcending law enforcement's forays into the psyche of these people, Svetozar Ristovski does a good job of portraying Moss as the perfectly ordinary guy who continually raises his hand in class too often not to ask questions but to ensure that everyone knows just how clever he is, who has it in his mind that he is going to do something absolutely *great* and bores everyone with the details.Moss was still a kid who needed to be watched. Indeed, this narcissistic intellectual hatchet-man should have been watched round the clock, as he was looking for validation in, well, the wrongest of places. Creating different identities based on the victims of the murderers he corresponded with (the surface reason was that this was necessary &#34;for his term paper&#34; on the criminal mind), he finally found a formidable target in the person of John Wayne Gacy. (Kinda weird that he would choose Gacy right off the bat. A killer with the specific MO of being interested in young guys? Like he was?)William Forsythe does a horrifyingly good job playing this monster, and at the beginning one almost roots for him; he's mowing down an arrogant little weirdo who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. Then, things get sad. He encourages Moss to do things so abominable that the implications are sickening and cannibalizes his mind with such enthusiasm that the only truly gratifying moment in the whole movie is when Moss informs Gacy, a day before his execution, that he was never anything more than a homework assignment.Jason Moss was, in part, a victim not only of a psychopathic serial killer but the overexposure of &#34;Ubermensch&#34; Nietzschean thinking that was curiously prevalent in the 90's. He thought of himself as a sort of intellectual Superman, ready to contend with those &#34;beyond good and evil&#34; and the rest of it. He was a bright kid who, given time, may have attained the sort of recognition he wanted. Lack of close supervision, Promethean ambition and arrogance put his brain on a veritable platter for Mr. Gacy.A great film with a similar theme would be &#34;Shock Corridor&#34;.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,May 24, 2015,B004G8SW3Y,Dear Mr. Gacy,Amazon Video,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G8SW3Y,none,none

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,A distant elegance,The work of Barbara Ungar has what I can only term a sort of distant elegance to it; the overall impressions of her poems is someone breathing on glass, or a crystal bell being rung. I saw her read one poem from this collection about a week ago at a &#34;poetry reading&#34;.She almost has the Janus female poetic face of the dearly departed Mark Strand. You get the same unapologetic humanism from both poets, and a deep appreciation of life's transience and fragility.

This shows that fortitude subjects the ancient and horrible serpent to disown power through the ways of righteousness. And he pierced the mouth of that dragon with the end of his javelin. As a result, the dragon vomited forth the foulest of foam.&#34;Blessed Hildegard of Bingen (German: Hildegard von Bingen; Latin: Hildegardis Bingensis) (1098  17 September 1179), also known as Saint Hildegard, and Sibyl of the Rhine, was a writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, German Benedictine abbess, visionary, and polymath. Elected a magistra by her fellow nuns in 1136, she founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165.Hildegard Von Bingen was a mystic of the first order; perhaps more direct even than Eckhart in the epic scope of liminal journeys, which walk on the walls of the celestial catacombs to the most fetid depths of hell. All while perhaps being guided by the Bride herself. This is as beautiful a poetry and prophecy as I've ever encountered.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,"What about you?",Sean Hogan's second full length film (running at a modest 74 minutes) is a brave exercise in literary, psychological horror. Reminiscent of a "Twilight Zone" episode or perhaps more appropriately an episode of "Thriller" with Boris Karloff, it has the feeling of a play by E.F. Benson.The mood, right from the start of the film, is a sort of otherworldly dread. Two hitmen, one aged (and looking every bit the elevator operator from hell) and one every bit the youthful moron wait in a man's house to kill him. He has something their boss covets.Things don't go well at all. Sitting in the to-be victim's home, we learn a bit about Pinner, the older murderer played by Billy Clarke, a fine actor. The dialogue is gut wrenching, as the illusion of "casually killing someone" is dispelled with the talk of a loving woman murdered and rolled up in a rug by his boss. By the end of the night both will know what they are made of. Especially Pinner.This is a neon lit, elegant descent into Baudelairean moral decay. While "Lie Still" still strikes me as Hogan's crowning glory, I have a feeling this will age well.

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Exhaustive.,Charles R. Cross did an unenviable amount of research for this book, which he's really framed as &#34;debunking Kurt Cobain's self-made myth&#34;. Who really believes what musicians say about themselves anyway?It stands to reason that all of Kurt Cobain's lyrics and art have a child's imaginative quality that is almost palpable. It was during his childhood that his life was torn up and thrown away like little pieces of paper. He was a happy little unit of a family that was functional at least on the surface. Don, his father made enough money to support the family, and Wendy, his wife, took him and his sister on regular outings. Kurt was the first to show up for &#34;family night&#34;, where the family members played parcheesi and Monopoly.Soon, Wendy began seeing another man. This was when Kurt Cobain's perfect drawing was torn up and a shadow was cast over it.The two divorced, and the demoralization was not restricted to Kurt. A friend recalls a 13 year old Kurt coming home to his mom unceremoniously f**king a young Romeo on the couch. Cobain told him to get the hell out. His mother would try to make herself &#34;part&#34; of his teenage parties, something Cobain couldn't equivocate with his mom when married to his father. He moved in with his father on the condition that his father never remarry. That didn't last.From here, the Kurt Cobain that the world would come to know was slowly born. The school he once attended, where he was well known and popular had to be left behind along with every other piece of his old life: at his new school, he became withdrawn and refused to participate.His interest in punk rock skyrocketed after seeing a Sammy Hagar concert. He joined the wrestling team and got to the top of the pyramid.When his father showed up to watch him became wrestling champion, he was infuriated that Kurt lost; not only that, but that he lost willingly while looking in his father's eyes.Kurt began dropping acid and drinking a lot, becoming increasingly cynical while *still* believing the family would regroup. What is noted by all of his friends is his obsession with death, and how he talked about it with the matter-of-factness another person might possess talking about fixing a spark plug. He never slept under a bridge, but the truth is a little more depressing: he slept in a cardboard refrigerator box in the ventilating system of an abandoned building. He also became the janitor at the school where he'd dropped out while everyone was still graduating.Humiliation is the watchword of Cobain's life. Music was his salvation but his aggravated depression (made worse by a suicidal heroin habit) did not allow his art to save him. He never committed himself to any person or situation (except in the case of Courtney Love, who knew how to prey on his need/fear dilemma, though she's not the demon people make her out to be) because there was always a chance it would disappear or hurt him. Kurt Cobain *never* wanted to be a small-yet-famous band like the Melvins. He always knew where up was and down was--probably because he had experienced poverty.This is a hard one to ingest, even for a rock star biography. It it is really, really incredible he was able to do what was he able to do while his circumstances were what they were--to become a musician as he did.It'd be nice to see Charles R. Cross or someone do a biography of Layne Staley. I always liked AIC better than Nirvana personally and it sounds like Staley has an interesting story, so why not?

They aren't just &#34;hits&#34;.I knew (and still know) very little about the history of REM when they were still a band and the lyrics and music immediately make me want to hear more REM. Michael Stipe is a masterful lyricist, knowing just when and where to employ ambiguity (&#34;Monty Got a Raw Deal&#34;) and when to have an elliptical directness (&#34;Drive&#34;).

J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,5,Just really well done,Trying to make absolute sense of this movie is like trying to make sense of &#34;Mulholland Drive&#34; after having first seen it. And people did that, I remember--pointing in the theatre: &#34;I think she had a split personality...knew it all along.&#34; It is a Rorschach blot with more than a couple of referents and semiotic trails, all of which are authentically horrifying.Basically, one friend shows up under the pretext of helping another friend fight his drug addiction up in the middle of nowhere, the boonies. (The director pulls something off here one doesn't usually see: he takes a nice slice of nature and makes it thoroughly appalling with the situation.) He uses a stun gun on him and chains him to a bed--not the healthiest way to detox someone from methamphetamine or even one that would necessarily work, but this is how the film begins.Trying to help his friend through the crushing depression and physical withdrawal from the drug, narratives about why said good friend is there start to get fuzzy. He claims his garbage pail buddy sent him some tapes of his drug abuse in a bid for help, or at least attention. Drug addicted friend genuinely does not recall doing this.From there, oddities start to drop one by one in the lap of the &#34;hero&#34;. Dealers show up looking for money, the Native American Security force--they are on a reservation--show up and tell them to be gone in two days, and that once there was a group of archaeological students living there. A Christian millennial group explains that a being of light will descend and eat everything, including the two friends. A dog dies in front of the camp and it belonged to a Frenchman who lives nearby in a trailer. He once taught at the Sorbonne, he explains, but prefers to study &#34;Man while being away from man&#34;. He explains that one's story has only three stages: a beginning, a middle, and an end. The mirror he uses while illustrating his point is one of the keys, I think, to the movie.They are privy to how they may exit the world, because the two have somehow earned a special kind of punishment: they are allowed to see how they will die if they don't act quick. Someone is filming them. None of this changes the drug addict's desire to keep using drugs: he doesn't really care about his friend's soon-to-be baby, and thinks he has an &#34;imaginary&#34; view of him. That is another key to the film.This is the best horror movie I've seen in some time and chills one right to the bone: using a sort of curse-of-theory-motif, it places the protagonists in a space where they can choose their destiny. My personal subjective viewpoint: the good friend's buddy chose it for them. His self destructive logic kills them both in the eyes of any mainstream viewer. Brilliant, and I wish Hollywood would spend more money on movies like this.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,March 15, 2015,B00B47NM0I,Resolution,Amazon Video,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B47NM0I,none,none
J from NY,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,3,Great performances,Charlie Therizon absolutely gives the performance of a lifetime as serial killer Aileen Wuornous in &#34;Monster&#34;. Christina Ricci does a spectacular turn as her lover and cohort, who eventually snitched on her.One would be hard pressed to find as difficult and tragic a life as Aileen Wuornous. Her father was a ped who went to jail almost a few years after she was born. Her brother died of cancer not long after.A traveling prostitute born in Michigan, Wuornous started executing men in the 1990's. She posed as a hooker and carried around photographs of her fictitious &#34;family&#34;, (you won't see that in the movie), gained their trust and then shot them, taking their money, and in one case unwisely retrieving a cop's nightstick and badge. In one of the most poignant and heartrending scenes in the film, she kills a traveling rodeo Christian (this is the South, after all) who wanted only to find lodgings for her and who, incredibly enough, actually trekked the night in his car looking for desperate hitchhikers to assist.Along with this movie there's been a documentary (by Nick Broomfield of &#34;Kurt and Courtney&#34; fame), a made for TV production called &#34;Overkill&#34;, and even an opera. Aileen herself benefited financially from &#34;Overkill&#34;, and the staff working on Broomfield's documentary were terrified of Aileen, saying she &#34;had the presence of a female Charles Manson&#34; and that she &#34;pushed everyone around&#34;. It was Jeb Bush who signed off on her execution.As leftists sometimes we go overboard. Everything isn't black and white, but everything isn't an ethical free for all either. I know plenty of women who have had lives comparable to Aileen Wuornous' and not a one has murdered 7 people. It's always sad when an actor or actress gives a Capital G great performance in a film that has a somewhat misguided trajectory: &#34;The Hurricane&#34; with Denzel Washington is one of those. The facts are all skewed and deliberately distorted in many cases to make Rubin Carter look innocent and a bigger deal than he ever was in boxing or in political activism or anything else. How do these stellar performance stand up to the test of time and the actual truth?A very very well acted *fictive* biopic.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HW33PQSRHLNO,July 28, 2015,B0029Z8K74,Monster (2003),Movies & TV,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029Z8K74,FIRST LOOK PICTURES,$39.69

Also, I tried following the instructions for making rice in the Wonderbag, and it didn't turn out even though I followed the instructions precisely.I can see where I might use this to transport hot foods to parties, as the insulation is fabulous, and I may use it with soups, stews, or chilis that are already cooked on the stovetop completely and just need to &#34;simmer&#34; and stay hot until dinner, but I won't be replacing my crock pot or rice cooker with this product.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,January 11, 2014,B00ESI96SW,Wonderbag Non-Electric Portable Slow Cooker with Recipe Cookbook, Red Batik,Grocery & Gourmet Food,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESI96SW,Wonderbag,$68.18

These are definitely shatterproof--just as it says--but I have to say they aren't exactly what I was picturing. They are thin--similar to a wine glass-- but the plastic they are made from is very flexible (hence the shatterproof). In reading reviews prior to purchase, someone had said they are a step up from a red solo cup, and I have to say I understand what they meant by that now. They are more flexible than a red solo cup, but the quality is about the same.All that said, they can be washed and reused multiple times, and the look from a distance (to others) will be that of a wine glass and not a red solo cup--which is what I was going for. I'm not thinking these are going to last for an extended period of time, but I'm sure they will get me through the summer.

Megan Long,AAMRL61XPUT8H,3,I really liked this toaster at first,I really liked this toaster at first. It looks nice and has nice, wide slots for the toast (with guards that tighten around your food to hold it in place). It was working really well at first, but now (about a year later) the toasting is inconsistent. One side is hotter than the other, so if you put toast in on both sides, one will come out burnt and the other not if you use the same settings. Additionally, there are times when we put it in and it's not done after one time down, and the next time it will come out burnt. Doesn't seem to create a consistent toast. The left side also seems to toast the back half of the bread faster than the front half, so you have an end that is dry or burnt and the other just barely toasted. You end up having to stand at the toaster, peeking in at the bread, trying to catch it at that perfect moment! Wouldn't recommend if you're in the market for a new toaster.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,August 6, 2015,B003A09ARG,Black & Decker TR1400SB 4-Slice Toaster, Black/Silver,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003A09ARG,Black & Decker,$34.99

The dog is 15 lbs, and this bowl is too big for what we need. I didn't think too big would be a problem, since he would have to chase the food around the bowl, slowing him down, and thus serving it's purpose..... but because he had such a chase around the bowl, it made him TOO slow. My other dog would be finished eating and would watch him struggle to &#34;catch&#34; the kibble. Eventually, the other dog would &#34;help out&#34; because the bowl was so large that the other dog was preoccupied on the other side of it. We ended up finding a smaller, less complex bowl that worked perfectly for our dog.

It's hard for them to get to the bottom of the bear, and then it's hard to clean out since the hole is so small.

We also have 2 neighbor dogs that are often left in the backyard while the owners go out for the evening. The dogs bark incessantly while the owners are away. We placed this on the fence, and it does calm them at first, however, over time they seem to become resistant to it, and begin barking away again.Because we use this outside, we have accidentally left it out in the rain, and it still works after the exposure.I can say it does work with some dogs, but may not be the be-all, end-all solution you are looking for.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,August 5, 2015,B00DS6BNKE,First Alert Bark Genie Automatic Bark Control,Pet Supplies,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DS6BNKE,Oster,$35.97

He would squeak it, toss it in the air and let it bounce around, and then chase after it. I was so happy to see him loving it so much and thought about immediately ordering more. It has now been 4 hours since it arrive, and he just came to me with the head torn off. No more squeaker, and the toy is ripping apart pretty easily now. Very disappointed that it didn't last longer.Also, I have a medium dog (about 20 lbs) and ordered the medium sized toy for him. It was smaller than I'd hoped.

Megan Long,AAMRL61XPUT8H,5,My favorite leash! This is perfect for walking two dogs,My favorite leash! This is perfect for walking two dogs! The best feature is the joint where the leash creates a Y, because it twists as the dogs move around. This means there's no untangling the leash as the dogs run back and forth looking at different things along the walk. The only challenge is when one of the two walks behind the walker--then you must step over. But if you can manage that, this leash makes walking multiple dogs easy!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,July 29, 2015,B007GCMCVU,Pet Parade No-Tangle Dual Dog Leash, Double Dog Leash Coupler for 2 Dogs, for Big Dogs,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GCMCVU,DOZENEGG,$9.15

Megan Long,AAMRL61XPUT8H,4,Good product, bad packaging!,I really like the coverage I get with the new Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up. It's very smooth and even, and feels light on your skin while providing really great coverage. The downfall is the poor packaging. The glass bottle has a very small opening to get the product out--you can't dip in your finger or makeup brush. The product is so thick that it doesn't easily pour out of the opening, and you spend some time trying to coax the foundation out of the bottle. This product needs to be in a squeeze tube or jar with a larger opening to be really useful. I would definitely buy again, but will continue to curse the packaging! #GotItFree,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,February 18, 2014,B00HNSS8X8,Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up, Natural Ivory, 1 Fluid Ounce,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNSS8X8,Neutrogena,$11.06

The metal hook is challenging. It falls off the rack it hangs on often. Since the oven is in use, it's then very hot, so hard to pick up and replace in it's spot.

Megan Long,AAMRL61XPUT8H,5,LOVE!,Admittedly, I've only used this product once, so my opinion could change, but I'm thinking it will only get easier to use!I read other reviews on here that talked about this tool cutting the drying time in half-- I didn't find that to be the case. Because you're creating curl at the same time, I erred on the side of smaller chunks at a time, which ended up taking just as long. The benefit however, comes with the end result!My hair looks like I had a blow-out at the salon. It is smooth and full and smooth. My hair naturally has this really tight curl in the back and a straight front, which makes it difficult to style. This product smoothed out everything so that you can't even tell that it has a tendancy to curl in the back. Previously I would have to blowdry, then sometimes flatten with a straight-iron the back portion, then curl with a fat curling iron to get everything uniform. I was able to style with just this tool today.Additionally, it was a lot simpler to use this tool. I didn't have to juggle the blowdryer and my round brush back and forth. I simply rolled each chunk up on the barrel and hit it with the hot air. At the end I stuck the barrel under the top chunks (so they just draped over the barrel,) hit is with hot, then hit it with cool, and the end result was a lot more volume on top. Love it!I will definitely be using this tool daily, and can tell it will be less stressful on both me and my hair!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAMRL61XPUT8H,January 13, 2014,B00022WA9K,Revlon Shine Enchancing Hot Air Kit,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K,Revlon,$29.48

Megan Long,AAMRL61XPUT8H,2,Not very durable,My husband is a carpenter and owns his own business. He is constantly putting his phone in and out of his work pants and puts cases through the ringer. Typically he only gets 6 mos or so out of a case. With this case, I don't think we'll make it to the 2 month mark.The case is definitely layered rubber--a white layer (for the log) with a black layer over it. Around the edges of the case and corners, the black layer has already worn off and the white is showing through. This not only looks bad, but it is obvious that the protection is getting thinner. Additionally, the rubber around the plug is not very durable, but rather is thin, and pulls away from the phone easily. I suspect this will break at some point in the near future and will be flopping around.We won't be buying another case like this when it comes time to replace it.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Perfect For The Ultimate Essential Oil Holiday Gift!,Wow! This is a super amazing set of essential oils! These truly are Pure Therapeutic Grade quality. I've done all the tests on them to make sure they aren't just diluted carrier oils that are scented and they passed with flying colors telling me this is a top quality product. You get Frankincense, Lemongrass, Clary Sage, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lime, Ylang Ylang, Orange, Eucalyptus, Cinnamon, Peppermint, and Lavender. Thats a fantastic combination. They come in 10 ml darkened glass bottles with the dropper stop at the top. I didn't have any issues with leaks or breaks upon delivery. They came quickly and were packaged fantastically well. I plan on giving these as a gift for the holidays to cheer up some of my friends who are struggling with hard times. I know they will go over well! I might even order extra and maybe even one for me.Naska is a super great company.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantastic New Breakfast Tool - Works Wonderfully Well Once You Figure Out Proper Use!,I love trying new products and especially new kitchen products. At first I was skeptical of these rings, but once I got over some learning curves on this product I found that I really loved them. First off, not only do they do nice omelets, but they do pancakes and keep fried eggs in neat circles. Now, some of the issues I had at first was that I tried to plop them on the grill about at the same time I poured pancake mix in. This is NOT the way to use them. Instead, heat them up along with the pan, meaning when you put your frying pan on the stove, put the rings in. Spray them with canola oil or some sort of 'pam' type spray thoroughly. Then pour your mixture (egg, pancake, etc) into the rings and your breakfast will come out absolutely PERFECT. Expect to make a few mistakes learning, but once you get the hang of these rings, they are absolutely brilliant! I am sure you will love them as much as I do.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,November 11, 2015,B00VUZ9UOG,NEW Chef Silicone Egg - Pancake Breakfast Sandwiches - Benedict Eggs - Omelets and More Nonstick Mold Ring Round, Blue (4-pack),Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUZ9UOG,CH-INT,$11.75
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Beautiful Corset For Costuming!,This is a beautiful corset. I purchased it with a steampunk costume in mind and it worked fabulously. When layered over a dark chocolate brown peasant blouse with a good bra, this corset truly showed off my curves and elongated my torso which allowed my layers of skirts to be shown off nicely. The front hooks and the back laces up so that means unlike most of the corsets you can buy in this category, this one has a bit of flexibility so you can really snug it up or loose it out depending on its use. It gives a fantastic amount of support for your back and ribs as well. I added steampunk embellishments on it to dress it up, but truthfully it needed no extras. It's made of a beautiful embroidered fabric that truly looks elegant wrapped around a ladies waist.I did order up two sizes above what I normally wear, so be aware these run small. I'm mildly surprised wen I see people say they run true to size because I've known several friends who have ordered these as well and they also found them small. That being said if you do get the wrong size (like one of my best friends did) then the seller is super willing to work with you to get the right one. She had a replacement in two days and only after it arrived did she have to ship her first one back. I think that's fantastic because after a seller has made a sale, there's nothing but good business compelling them to help fix it if folks are unhappy with something like sizing.In fact I wish Wuhu would make a wider variety of clothing. The brand is so easy to work with that I'd feel confident ordering any sort of garment from them after how they handled my friend's corset exchange. But enough about them. This corset is very easy to clean too. I just spot clean when I get spills and leave it to air dry flat.

This is a really fantastic moisturizer that doesn't break me out, leave me oily, or otherwise mess up my face. I've been using it in conjunction with Radiencee's Facial Cleanser that's also 100% organic and natural. I can't rave about the two of these products enough. If ever there was a power duo in the bathroom for a morning and night routine, this is it! I have nothing bad to say about this product. I love the way it leaves my skin soft and feeling pampered. I like the light almost not there scent of soft herbal goodness. I even like the consistency, which can sometimes be weird in these kinds of products.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Tea. Super Big Help For Breaking A Soda Addiction!,This lovely tea has a remarkable taste. I truthfully enjoyed both brewing it fresh and drinking it twice a day. I even used it to replace snacks. I've been dieting a great deal lately along with putting some more exercise into my life and this tea frankly has been something of a life saver. You see, I cut out soda and desperately needed a replacement. I used this tea to not only detox with but to substitute for the soda. And day one I really hated it. But I stuck with it and as I weened myself off the soda, I started looking forward to my tea. And now I simply really really love having it. I feel better, have a ton more energy, and just feel like my health is better overall. Is this tea to blame? No. But it sure helped keep me on the path when going through the soda withdrawals and it has since really found a tasty place in my heart.I think Green Root Wellness has a really great product. It's fresh, has a great herbal taste, and comes packaged in a way that we can easily measure it out and seal it back up. A little goes a long way and this entire package lasts far longer than 14 days. I highly recommend this blend.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Perfect For My Essential Oil Diffusers And Homemade Facial Lotions!,Natural Acres makes a wonderful product here in their Grapefruit Essential Oil. It has a super nice citrus scent that works wonders in an oil diffuser especially if you want to level out cooking smells in the kitchen. I've also used it for a massage oil because its fantastic for tension headache across the brows, menstrual cramps around the abdomen, and my favorite spot - back of the calves for long days at work. This product comes in a standard 10ml bottle with a dropper insert lid. It's the standard size to fit most house and car diffuser oil holders. And it is 100% pure.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantastic Shampoo For Chow Chows, Poodles, and Mutts!,I have a white Chow Chow and hes hard to keep clean. He has very sensitive skin and he can get stinky just by roaming around outside. I really haven't had any luck with dog shampoo until I tried Bubbas Groovy Bath Ultra Oatmeal Dog Shampoo! My dog reacted very well to this. First off it actually cleaned his creamy white coat and got him back to his pale glowing self. Secondly it gave him a luxurious feel to his fur. His barnyard stench is gone and hes super pleasant to be around again. And one bonus to this shampoo is that although its bright pink, it doesn't stain, but really helps you as a dog owner see where the shampoo has gone. It turns into a lovely foaming white scrub that rinses out of the coat nicely.I have a Chow Chow, a white mini poodle, and a Mutt that's mostly lab. All three of these dogs really had a great result when I used this shampoo on them.I just really really really love the way this shampoo preformed.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Crystal Clear Non-Staining Fragrance Free Lubricant That Rules Its Lubricant Category!,This is a very thick crystal clear non-staining and fragrance free lubricant. I like that its thick because it coats the surface of whatever its applied to well and does a fantastic job of sticking and lubricating without being sticky or becoming chunky. It has water as its primary ingredient as well as propylene glycol, cellulose gum, aloe leaf, and several other very holistic ingredients. This anal lube comes in a 4oz tube that's easy to slip into a drawer or purse and one can definitely travel with it without issue.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,My Husband Loves This Kit!,My husband has very sensitive skin when shaving. In fact, he can't even shave more than once every few days. If he shaves daily, he gets horrible red bumps and breaks out from the razor. It usually doesn't matter what sort of shaving cream or aftershave he uses. However, Concept Laboratories has a great product! The kit contains a 4oz daily cleanser, .9oz sandalwood preshave oil, 1.4oz shave cream, 1.25oz after shave balm, all of which make a huge difference in his skin behaving in the face of shaving. The soothing oil helps his skin deal with the razor while the cream helps as hes doing so. The shave balm utterly soothes his skin when hes done and of course the daily skin cleaner is fantastic for getting the day to day grime off.This is a great product. I highly recommend it. The only suggestion I can make is that for the price, Concept Laboratories should provide larger containers. You can buy these products on their own, but the kit is a fantastic way to really explore whether you like the products or not.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,November 7, 2015,B013PHDFTC,Advanced Clinicals Luxury Men's Shave Kit: Glycolic Acid Cleanser, Sandalwood Pre-shave Oil, Self-foaming Shave Cream, and After-shave Moisturizing Balm Cream,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013PHDFTC,Concept Laboratories,$22.97
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Gift! Wonderful For Both Girls And Boys.,What a delightful little RFID Blocking Credit Card Holder! I love the fact that for its inexpensive price, this little wallet looks like a million bucks. It has a super nice shine on it. It's design is lovely, not overly feminine or masculine, so it really works for a male or female. If your female, it fits in a small clutch super nicely and makes your cards easy to find. If you are a male, it gets your bulky cards out of your wallet and out of your back pocket and down discretely in your front pockets in a far more comfortable spot. It holds quite a few cards, has an easy latch to get into and to close it securely with. I just think this is a really super nice gift. It would be great as a 'thank you' for a favor to a friend. It would make a nice stocking stuffer. Or, if you want to add a little bit of pizzazz to a present, use it as a 'garnish' on the top of a package. It will tremendously add to the appeal of anything its added too or used as a decoration on. Protectif has a great product here. I can see it appealing to a wide range of tastes and needs, especially since its not 'cheap' in its design and will last for a long time if properly taken care of.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 23, 2015,B00ZBWTDKU,Credit Card Holder - Silver Stainless Steel RFID Blocking Credit Card Protector - For Men & Women - Latest Slim Metal Case & Stylish Travel Wallet as Gift - Best Protection for Your Bank and ID cards Against RFID Scanners - Money Back Guarantee,Office Products,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZBWTDKU,Protectif,$24.59

This isn't so much needed in the summer, but now that its late fall heading like a freight train into winter those of us who are die-hard grilling fiends really need light on our grills because we are outside grilling at all hours. This light is like a huge brilliant beam that is tall enough it illuminates the whole bbq and frees up your hands to flip meat, baste, and do all the normal bbq things people do without having to juggle a flashlight and judge if our burgers, steak, and chicken are done. This runs on batteries and is really deceptively huge. You can't tell from the pictures, but this thing is hefty! It has a clip so that you can afix it almost anywhere.

I also got a free microfiber electronics cloth along with them. But I have a confession. I didn't buy them for a baby around my house. Instead I bought them for cleaning and polishing glass. I'm a glass artist and do a lot of firing glass in kilns. When you are dealing with fusible glass, fingerprints will SHOW when you don't clean your glass thoroughly before melting it in the kiln. Its really hard to find great quality cloths that won't leave lint and debris behind. These Elite Tech Gear BabyBeeLoved Bamboo Baby Washcoths are PERFECT for us glass artists.

This means once a week we test the car, or one of two trucks, the trailer, the tractor, and even the horse trailer. This Travelsafer Digital Tire Pressure Gauge is a lifesaver to my family. Its' so simple and easy. We don't have to worry about using the old fashioned one that doesn't read that accurately to begin with. With this device, my husband has significantly cut down his time spent maintaining tires and airing them up. We also go through less rubber because when you maintain correct pressure, you get the best possible wear out of your tires. Why wear them out prematurely when you spend so much for them to begin with? I also love the fact this gauge lets you easily read it in the dark.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Forumla. Works Virtually Overnight!,This Serum was surprisingly well formulated. I should have expected such from Pure Body Naturals, a company that in my experience has always delivered a great product. The formula was clear, thick, and easy to dab on breakouts without smearing it across your whole face. Spot treatments are the way to go with acne when you have bad breakouts. The formula had a slightly chemical smell to it which wasn't too pleasant, but it was light enough you didn't notice after the first initial sniff. This serum definitely stays on your skin and doesn't soak in and disappear. It leaves a slight residue behind, which is associated with its active ingredients. As long as you use this at night before bed and not part of your morning beauty routine there's going to be no issue. I found that it did clear breakouts FAST - like next day they were gone fast - and that was astonishing.

I fish up in Washington state at the various lakes around White Pass out highway 12. We've managed to land bass, lake trout as big as 15 lbs, and even a catfish with this rod. It's really versatile and will do anything you ask of it. I think my huge lake trout was the upper limit of its abilities, but man this little rod works well with anything under that. I'm starting to realize that Priscfun has great products. This is high quality fishing gear at its finest.I also own big box fishing poles and very high end stuff from famous sporting goods stores.

You get a nail file, tweezers that grip nicely, and a codone extractor for blackheads. This kit literally has it all. There are twelve tools in all. Twelve!

The hand pads were fantastic too, comfortable, and gave us a really good grip. Both items were easily washable and you just drape them over something to dry for a few minutes. I can't tell you how fantastic these are compared to other more expensive high end wraps. I would pick these any day over the ones that run into the twenties and thirties in terms of price.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Best Cable I Own!,I'm in LOVE! Finally a cable that is sturdy, doesn't crimp, and is an amazing six feet long. Basically things thing stretches anywhere you need it to and then some. I love the light minty green color because its so easy to pick out among your other cables. I have one of those stupid cars that only has one single plug at the front. There's no place for passengers to charge their phones or devices in the back seat. This cable SOLVES that problem completely. I would have never thought until I bought this car that anyone would have had a need for a 6ft charger, but the truth is everyone in this situation does.The other issue I want to talk about is the fact that Hi-Speed means HIGH SPEED in this case. Some companies just brag their chargers charge fast, but ECEEN absolutely means it when they say that. I can have my kindle at dead and have it fully charged in a half hour. The same goes with my smart phone.I cannot say anything bad about this cable. It's wonderful. It's absolutely wonderful. ECEEN is a brand I've learned to be utterly loyal too.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,As A Female You Need These!,I'm one of these people that often wonder what we'd do without modern technology or access to a store. I hadn't heard about menstrual cups before this year and when I did hear about them I was a little skeptical. But LolaCup makes a great product that really works. There are a lot of advantages to it as well. First and foremost, its reusable, and keeps dirty pads out of the garbage and landfills. You don't have to buy pads. And you don't have to worry about leaking, smelly, disgusting pads. These cups just insert, catch the blood firmly, and hold it until you and remove them and clean them out. They are so much nicer than tampons because you don't have the whole string thing that gets frankly gross. These are easy to remove, easy to insert, and I just use a very generic mild menstrual cup soap to clean and sterilize them. The other good thing about these menstrual cups is that they can definitely go into a bug-out bag of emergency supplies and might just be something you are incredibly grateful to have one of these days. In the age of Preppers and folks worried about the future, these cups are a definite inclusion for any sort of pre-planning for any sort of natural disaster or emergency evacuation.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 9, 2015,B0150B4KAE,LolaCup Set of 2 Menstrual Cups with Pouch Bag - Reusable Period Cup made of Best BPA Free, 100% USA Medical Grade Silicone - Pink Menstruation Cup with Short Stem - Size 1 (Small),Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0150B4KAE,LolaCup Menstrual Cup,$26.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Gorgeous Bracelet! I Kept It For Myself!,Gorgeous Bracelet! I originally ordered this bracelet for my husband, but when it came I loved it so much I kept it for myself. It's advertised as Men's Jewelry, but heck I have a large wrist and absolutely loved the way it fell on my wrist and how it was the perfect size! This 18K Stamp Gold Plated Bracelet is very well made and looks very expensive on your wrist. It was easy to clean in my jewelry cleaner and has a very strong clasp that holds its significant weight well clamped around my wrist. I would not hesitate one bit using U7 Fashion Jewelry for jewelry purchases in the future. I've read nothing but good about them and finally have had a chance to try one of their products for myself and can tell you first hand that what people say about their high quality goods is absolutely true!

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Leash For My Mini Poodle!,This is such a cute yet tough little dog leash. I recently inherited a poodle from my mother who died of cancer and needed a good leash for her. This retractable dog leash from BonaFido (Adorable name right?) Pet Supplies was perfect. She's under 44 lbs and where I walk her I need to carry little doggie bags with me to pick up her little gifts to the world. This leash does the trick nicely, retracts smoothly, and really keeps her wild poodle ways in line. The dangling bag of doggie disposable poo bags is perfect. They aren't bulky in my pocket, and the whole setup isn't heavy so its not hard to hold. I've dropped it accidentally numerous times on cement and its held up like a champ. I really like mine and the color matches my cute little white poodle's hot pink collar and dark pretty eyes. I highly recommend this Dog Leash for anyone with a mini to small dog who loves to go for walks.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Super Great Knives For All Purpose Use!,These are really fantastic knives. This truthfully was my second set of ceramic knives, my first being of the very small paring knife variety. I absolutely love my paring knives but I was having a hard time believing the larger knives could be as good. They really are! I love this larger sized knife. It's definitely a step up and great for almost everything around the kitchen. It's perfect for cutting up onions, slicing carrots, or even trimming the fat off steaks. I've tried them on almost everything I could try in the kitchen and they worked great. I really do appreciate the fact, as well, that they come with knife guards which makes it so easy to toss them in my utensil drawer. I hang my metal knives out in the open on a magnetized knife rack, and really that becomes the only draw back of ceramic knives. They won't adhere. But, the guards counteract that fact and really keep the knives safe and sharp.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,September 23, 2015,B00TYUNCLG,Deluxe Ceramic Knives Set - No More Sharpening, Keep Your Food Pure, Will Never Rust! - 5" Santoku & 3" Paring Knife - by Raku Cutlery,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TYUNCLG,Raku Cutlery,$34.95

These are thickly insulated extra long gloves that allow me to do my hobby without any further worry of getting burned! You see I've just recently started working with stained glass which naturally lead me to work with fused glass and create jewelry.

I love it when a set of headphones completely wow's me out of the box like Tzumi's Bluetooth Stereo Foldable Headphones do. These are great! They are a nice color and fit amazingly well over your ears. They hug your head softly so they hold themselves up in a nice way but don't muss your hair or pinch your brain. They charge quickly and last about six hours or a little longer before they need another charge. I use them when I'm working on art and not only do they help me focus by tuning out all the noise around me, but by streaming wonderful music into my ears that have notes I can't get on normal headphones. Isn't that the truth though? When you get a really good set of headphones, like these Tzumi bluetooth Stereo ones, then you suddenly hear tones and notes in favorite songs you've never heard before and it causes you to fall in love with music all over again.They are THAT good.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,I Love This Set So Much I Bought Multiples For Gifts!,OMG! This is a win win for someone who both loves to cook and loves the color pink. This is seriously one of the nicest sets of Lucentee I've ever seen. It's a perfect combo of spatulas - both big and small - scrapers, and spoons. There isn't a tool in this set you can't use. I got this originally for myself and then I turned around and got several more for gifts. My art teacher just lost her beloved oven of a million years and had to replace it due to no parts being available. I presented her a set of this Lucentee Baking Tools and she was absolutely thrilled. She loves pink as much as I do and totally 'gets it' about having nice things to use in the kitchen. These are nice! I expect to have them for years to come and to not deal with them chipping, cracking, and wearing like the old time spatulas used too.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantastic Heavy-Duty Grater That's Good For Everything!,First off, I'd like to say this Rotary Grater is incredibly heavy duty. When I first saw it I was thinking it might be complicated or awkward, or even worse unsteady. It was a pleasant surprise to find that not only did it sit nice and sturdy on the workstation, but it wasn't wobbly or awkward at all! The three blades it comes with (for fine, medium, and course grating) interchange easily and the whole thing really just cleans up with a quick rinse or a dunk in a sudsy sink and then a rinse. I loved how the handle is easy to grip, turns smoothly, and makes short work of the veggies and cheese you load into the hopper area to grate. I did find it a bit annoying that I had to cut up vegetables and cheese into fairly small chunks to run it through the grater, but I got used to it quickly. I was super happy to discover the really course grater blade does fantastic hashbrowns. Not a lot of these rotary graters do so. They tend to shred the potatoes too small and make them slightly mushy. Not this Heavy Duty Rotary Grater! In fact, this grater saved me hours of time when it came to Zucchini season. I have an entirely unhealhty fondness for Zucchini and tend to grate it and freeze it much like one would frozen hashbrowns. That means I can pull it out of the freezer year round for Zucchini Bread, Zucchini Pancakes, and the all important stuffing for green peppers. I did so many zucchini that under normal hand grating times I would have been at it days. With this grater I was just at it about an hour. In fact, it took me longer to sort and store in individual freezer bags, the already shredded zucchini than it did to actually shred it! That's win win for me. This product is absolutely worth the money and is built so that with proper care you should have it your whole life and perhaps even pass it on to the next generationI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 8, 2015,B003YKXJPQ,Westmark Germany Heavy Duty Rotary Grater,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YKXJPQ,Westmark,$22.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Best Bowls I've Ever Owned!,I love these bowls! They are great stack-able bowls that have so many little touches of elegance and thoughtfulness about them that they'd make fantastic gifts for a baker or cook in your family. Why? Well first, the three sizes give you effective bowls for almost any size of project you need. Secondly, they have little touches that really heighten their usefulness and thoughtfulness over all. They have a COATING on the bottom that looks like silicone which keeps them from banging the counter, banging each other when stacking them, or sliding around on say slick stone counter tops. The coating grips the counter and assists you in holding the bowl steady as you use it. Next they have little pour spouts that are absolutely handy for sauces and any kind of liquid item you might use in them. And finally the handles are perfect for gripping to pour the contents out. These are super high quality professional level bowls. Any cook or baker would love them. I would not hesitate to grab these for part of a wedding present or even a house warming for a new home owner. :)I received this item at a discount price in return for an honest and unbiased review.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Mother Lode Of BBQ Tool Sets!,This is honest to God the mother lode of all BBQ Tool Sets. You get 18 stainless steel tools each strapped into a stainless steel briefcase lined with cushioned foam. My husband was THRILLED to say the least to get this. It contains one large spatula, one pair of tongs, one huge 15' kitchen knife. You get a large stainless steel two-prong fork, steak knives,a silicon basting brush, eight corn picks, and one tough grill scrubbing bush. Like I said these are all utterly stainless steel, easy to clean, and so neatly stored. This is really the perfect gift for any guy or gal that loves to grill. I'd definitely think about this for a Father's Day gift, Christmas gift, or even a birthday present. This is just a wonderful set of tools!

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Perfect Addition To Your Beauty Routine,I literally use sweet almond oil for almost everything. I make a lot of health and beauty items at home and find that Pure Body Natural's Sweet Almond Oil works fantastically well for lotions, cleansers, and even additions to lip balms and other things. I even use it to CLEAN things with. I find if you saturate a beauty blender with your sweet almond oil, rub it in good, and then wash it out with a good quality soap, you will remove ALL the stains your foundations and every other kind of makeup can leave. Sweet almond oil is wonderful for a facial cleaner too. You can use it to remove dirt, oil, makeup etc and it washes away clean without leaving your skin feeling greasy.I had zero issues with Pure Body Natural's version of Sweet Almond Oil.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Combo! This Is Super Useful Around My Home!,I really enjoyed this brush/glove combo. First off the brush is sturdy, heavy duty, and does an awesome job cleaning. It's so hefty that you don't even need to add a cleaner. If I feel I need too, I might squirt a little vinegar that I have in a spray bottle onto the grill, but I just do this to get rid of discoloration. The brush stores nicely next to my grill hanging with the rest of my accessories and its truthfully one of the best brushes I've ever used. It has a big handle and is just large enough so I don't have to scrub massively hard. I just have to brush lightly and the grill is clean.The glove is a bright lime silicone. I started out leaving it outside with my grill, but now I keep it in the kitchen next to the stove. It's just simply too handy to not have it within reach for hot pan handles and to grab things one-handed out of the oven. I highly recommend this combo and give it five stars hands down.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 5, 2015,B014JP46BU,Best BBQ Grill Brush + Heat Resistant Silicone Kitchen Glove Set. 18" w/ 3 Stainless Steel Barbecue Brushes Smoker Cleaner Outdoor Cooking Tools with Protective Grilling Oven Mitts Utensils,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014JP46BU,Tevelo,$16.97
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great All Around Pack!,I've always been a big fan of ECEEN. I own several of their wall/car/USB chargers, power packs, and solar chargers. This daypack takes the cake of handy dandy devices to drag around when your on the go. It's not a super big pack, for one, which is nice because you can switch a purse out for it and still fit some books, notebooks, kindle, snacks, and anything else you might want to drag along. It is perfect for a hike or even some serious urban wandering. And of course, the solar charger on the back is absolutely perfect for charging your devices as you go. I've found this particular solar charger does fine charging my kindle, phone, and various USB charged flashlights and even my stun gun. Heh. Don't judge me.Now onto the pack itself. Its small, compact, and just large enough that you aren't weighing yourself down utilizing it. The stitching is super well made, the compartments handily divided into the sort of cubbys you need, and the whole thing folds up into one small pouch so you can go ahead and toss this in a suitcase for some European hiking or even the glove box of your truck for when you might need a pack off roading or hiking a new unexpected trail.Love love love this pack.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great For Long Haired Women!,I'm that girl that is always walking around with her we hair in a towel. And wow, all my life I've been using bulky cotton towels that stay wet and don't really assist in drying. I have a lot of hair (massive amounts) and its super long so if I don't get it dry right away, being from the pacific northwest, there's always a chance of mold. Have you ever smelled a girl with long hair who has a slightly mildewish-moldish odor? Odds are its her hair. So you learn fast that if you don't want fried hair from a hair dryer (which is hellish on hair) you need to do something else. This Microfibre Hair Towel does the trick! It wicks water away from your head, dries your hair super fast, and is so lightweight you won't be walking around gathering a headache because of the weight on your head.I just really highly recommend this towel.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This is a FANTASTIC gift idea for someone special!,I ordered this beautiful candle in vanilla which was a pale golden white. The smell was divine and really thrilled my friend who was the recipient of this gift. I made this candle a focal centerpiece of a gift basket to cheer up a friend who was having a rough time lately due to the death of a parent and the loss of a job. She literally cried when she opened my gift basket which also included a mug, some hot cocoa and tea, and some bath salts as well as gift soaps and other pampering little female items. I even threw in a few of my favorite books. She loved it and called me the moment she had the candle lit and was relaxing with her tea. She thanked me over and over again and called the gift super thoughtful. She's done far more for me in the past, so I was thrilled to make this candle part of my 'cheer her up' gift.I highly recommend this candle and all its other counterparts (you can get it in sooo many scents!) because its super high quality and drop dead gorgeous. It flickers beautifully and makes patterns against a darkened wall while burning in its glass container.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Towel Is Great For Dealing With Hot Flashes & Hot Sweaty Workouts.,Menopause is a killer. Seriously. If your not there yet and female, its nothing to look forward too. I get hot flashes and that coupled with my constant attempts to sweat my body into some kind of shape now that I'm over forty, I'm HOT all the time. If I'm not having a hot flash, I'm sweating to the oldies (oldies being 80's monster ballads) and trying to reclaim my youth. MP's Cooling Towel is a lifesaver for someone like me. Its' easy to use. You simply wet it, wring it out, and let it cool you off for hours. I love the size and shape of this towel too. It's perfect for wrapping around your neck and only needs to be rewetted after a few hours.The only thing I didn't like about this towel is the texture. That's a bit rubbery but you get used to it after a while. And again it has to be this way because of the high tech fabric its made out of that keeps the moisture cool. And word to the wise! Don't be tempted to stick it in the freezer. I tried that and it freezes into a hardened mess. Let it thaw out normally and never do it again. Don't even tell anyone you did it. The advanced fabric is designed for cold water, not ice, and you can damage the towel if you try to pull two frozen sections of it apart. I did not experience this, but one of my friends with this very same towel made that mistake and it didn't go well.I want to say that this towel is really a lifesaver.

This Lubricant by Dear Lady Collection is fantastic because its first and foremost ingredient is water. Then it has glycogen, glycerin, and vitamin E. There's a few other natural oils in it as well, which makes this Lubricant high up on my list of favorites due to its healthy content. A little bit of this lubricant goes a long way. Seriously a few tiny drops on any sort of toy or body part is enough to do the trick. And that's fantastic because you get a large 4oz bottle that's easy to tuck away in a drawer somewhere.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Perfect Oil To Open Airways!,I love this product! Eucalyptus is one of my favorite essential oils and I utilize it frequently to help clear coughs and colds. I am a hot tub owner and love making my own essential oils scent additives to scent the waters of my hot tub. I've been suffering from a huge upper respiratory infection lately (on antibiotics to clear it) and really can't breathe well at times. I've used this essential oil to add to carrier oils and then add to the waters of my hot tub to really help my breathing. It works fantastically well, either on its own or coupled with a few of the other oils well known to help with opening airways (Peppermint, Almond, Rosemary, Lavender). These oils, especially Eucalyptus, really give me the extra lung power I need to make it through the day and actually thrive. I'm going to survive this URI thanks to Natural Acres.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Strikingly Neat Labels!,These are really nice stickers! I love the variety of circles and sizes that you get in this package. I immediately labeled all my storage containers in my pantry with these and found them tough and reusable. When I emptied out the containers and switched what products they held, I have no problems wiping the label clean and re-writing a new title on the labels.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,So Cheerful And Perfect For Any Occasion!,This is a great bikini for the price. It's very well sewn with good fabric. The bottoms are nicely lined and the top has a removable light pad that protects the girly bits from cold reveals if you know what I mean. Now, its a bikini so there's not too much to say about it because there's not too much to it. That's the point right? But this colorful bouncy fringe filled rainbow of goodness is just flat out fun. You'll get comments wearing this anywhere. And its all but perfect to throw on a sarong with and move from afternoon to evening. Even if your out dancing, your flying fringe will keep any mosquitoes off and keep your high class party or riverside tailgate going comfortable all night long. I just love the way the fringe hangs and dances. It draws the eye down and really accents your stomach area and compliments your ribs. The design of this bikini is fantastic and I've had no problems wearing it then washing it. It still looks brand new!Great Garment! I can't recommend it enough.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Crown Jewel Of My Pizza Making Paraphernalia!,I thought my pizza lovers dream came true when I got a pizza stone. Little did I know I was lacking the ultimate tool in pizza cutting. This 14&#34; Pizza Cutter consisting of a Rocking Blade is absolutely the BEST PIZZA LOVERS TOOL EVER! I'm serious. My stone was a thrill to receive. I even have one of those pizza paddles that fetches it out of the back of the oven. But this.... this makes PERFECT slices and really just is the icing on the cake for everyone who loves pizza. I love pulling it out when we have guests over (or even when its just us and we make our own prepackaged pizzas at home) and it makes short work of cutting a pie into slices. I've had it a few weeks now and probably have cut about 10 pies with it. It hasn't gotten dull, and because its 14&#34;, I find that its just perfect for any size pie, even the big ones. My slices are even, symmetrical, and this cutter cuts them all the way through to the stone on the first rock. Mezini just has a super cool product here. No complaints at all. It is easy to clean as well. I don't put any of my knives in the dishwasher. I simply wipe them down with antibacterial cloths and keep them on a magnetic strip designed for good knives. This blade fits up there too and is the grand-daddy of them all.This Blade is honestly the crown jewel of my pizza making paraphernalia.I LOVE THIS BLADE! And I've used it at least three or four times last week. It's great for cutting strips in puffed pastry. It's great in cutting cinnamon logs into cinnamon rolls. Really, the sky is the limit on its endless uses.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,September 13, 2015,B00XAYSIXO,Pizza Cutter - 14" Curved Rocking Blade By Mezini, Sharp Straight Cut, Ergonomic, No Mess - Your Kitchen Perfected,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XAYSIXO,Mezini,$18.85

I practically live on both devices so its important that I can charge them anywhere even if I don't have a car charger or wall charger to plug into. This power bank by iMuto solves so many problems! Its really hefty and super impressive in how it handles the task. It always gives me a readout so I know how powered up it is too. That way I can charge it up when I'm at home and have it ready to head out on the road again.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Is Truly Take It To The Next Level Body Butter!,I love Shea Body Butter. One could say I'm picky and almost a connoisseur of the stuff. One thing I do not like about Shea Butter is its natural smell. It's not a strong smell, but its not particularly pleasing to me. And that's strange because I love almond and walnuts and the smell of almost any other nut out there on the planet. But that being said I LOVE what Shea Butter does for my skin. It's the type of thing you slather anywhere and it fixes anything relating to flaky, dry, and damaged skin. When you mix it with coconut oil, your increasing the situation of win win to extremely awesome. So then... not only has La Cream done that... Shea Butter plus Coconut Oil... they have addressed the scent issue. Add in some delicious vanilla and patchouli and you get OMG Cream!This is truly OMG Cream. I love it! I highly highly recommend this to anyone who loves plain Shea Butter. This is like the top shelf of Shea Butter Products!

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Wonderful Pore Minimizing Serum!,First off I'm a big fan of Mediderm Laboratories. They make fantastic products. This Pore Minimizer Serum comes in a giant 1.7 oz package so you get a lot for your money. It has a fantastic smell and gives your face a firming tightening lift. Basically you wash your face thoroughly, dry it, and then smooth on a light amount of this product and leave it on. It gently tightens your pores and really helps especially around those horrible areas us women have to deal with - nose, chin, forehead - where we can get pores of outrageous sizes. I always feel super refreshed after using this product and can first hand attest to the fact that it really does work.I also should say I'm prone to breakouts and being overly sensitive to anti-aging and vitamin C products. This pore serum does not break me out at all. Its really just a great product.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,November 7, 2015,B00DMK8X0E,Mediderm® Pore Minimizer Serum,Beauty,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DMK8X0E,none,none
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Phone Charger/Holder!,This is a fantastic cell phone holder. This is the second one I've owned from this brand, the first being 'borrowed' from me by a friend who just had to have it. I understand her desire to acquire too because this Cell Phone Car Holder Mount has everything. Gigue creates a truly great product. Why? It's built to fit ANY cellphone and most smaller tablets. It plugs into your car charger but then it gives you a second charger AND two usb plug in ports so suddenly your single car charger (mine only has one) turns into FOUR... the holder, and the three plugs. It makes things incredibly better in terms of you and multiple people traveling in a vehicle and needing to charge their phones as you go. No more sharing or fighting over a single plug.This mount is perfect.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Tapestry For Meditative Space!,This is a really great Tapestry. It has vibrant relaxing blue colors and it looks fantastic on the wall behind my meditative space. Its bright colors are soothing, cheerful, and very balancing to view. The cloth itself is sturdy, washable, and when it is washed it doesn't fall apart. This is really great quality material.I have received a ton of compliments from it and many people have asked me where I got my wall hanging. I have showing more than one person the link on Amazon and they've ordered one of their own. I often like watching it as I meditate and use it as a spiritual pathway, doing a separate meditation on each ring as I move my eye towards the center of the tapestry.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,So Great I Ordered Them Twice!,These tiny little bottles are so great! I am using them for a Halloween party to house tiny little bits of colored sugar water with tags on them called 'Witches Brew'. They are going to be part of a party game whereas people have to find their matching 'brew' on a person of opposite sex. This is a great way to use them in mixers.This isn't the only use I have for these. In fact, I loved the first batch so much I ordered a second batch because I do stained glass art. I want to be able to solder these little bottles into some of my stained glass Halloween art to allow for a sort of 3D effect on some of the stained glass signs I make. These bottles are light, can be made colorful (by adding liquid, colored sugar, etc) and tacked on to almost any project by a thin lead ring around their tiny necks. I just love them so much! I can't recommend them enough.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I loved them so much I ordered a second batch!

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Very Easy System To Install And Use! I Love It!,This is the second security system I've ordered on Amazon. This one is by far superior to the other one that involved so much writing and hooking up to a computer that we really couldn't get it figured out. With Amcrest's WLD895US Wireless Camera and tablet system we had no problems whatsoever hooking this up and running it. I did have to run down to the local bigbox and buy a 64 gig memory card for it, but that was no big deal. I love how much this really works for our family. We have the front deck all monitored and the film stored in case we have any issues. The color is bright and the picture is amazingly clear. The mounting and positioning of the camera was the hardest and it literally took my husband five minutes. We did have to drill a hole through one outside wall, but that was no big deal either. I thought it was also amazing that you had remote view involved with this camera.One of the other features I love is the fact that the camera's are weatherproof. That gives us far more options for placing them outside. They also have motion detectors and RF antennas. Overall this is a win win situation. The only thing I didn't like about this package is that it only comes with one camera. Once you have one, you really do want all four. So that means we're ordering three more. We need two for our barns and one more for the deck and driveway.Amcrest has an awesome product here. I can't thank them enough for making this system so easy that the layman who's not interested or skilled in computer technology can set up a system like this with almost no issues.I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Wallet. My Husband Loves It!,My husband loves this wallet. It's well organized, sturdy, and holds all of his credit cards and ID cards. It has room for money and even has a place to neatly store receipts until he gets home and puts them in our year-to-date shoebox. The leather is really nice and there's no question in my mind that its real. It has a good feel - buttery soft comes to mind - yet my husband has had no problems with it being in his pocket and staining when it gets wet. We live in the Pacific Northwest, so sometimes damp does become a problem and cheap wallets can bleed out the leather dye. This one does not! It's super top quality and he even asked me to bookmark the company and style so that when his wears out (he goes through one about once every two-three years) I could find the style and brand again.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,GREAT USB CHARGING STATION!,I have a lovely white crafting cabinet next to my couch. I ordered this charger because I loved that it had seven ports and was white. I also read the other reviews and saw that it was really getting good feedback. So I decided to give it a try and test it out for myself. First off I added some Velcro to the back side of it and some velcro to my cabinet and afixed it to the side. It worked wonders, blending into the cabinet and giving my cell, kindles, and other devices places to charge that were discrete and not taking up counter space. Now I can safely and easily charge seven devices. And its fast! How fast? I had my Amazon HD Fire 7 at 2% and a half hour later it was almost fully charged.

They come in a set of six BEAUTIFUL cobalt blue glass. The lids are secure and they have a nice roller tip that allows your contents to roll smoothly across your skin to dispense. I used mine for homemade perfumes and absolutely love them. They are completely and utterly reusable and fit perfectly well in ones' purse so travel isn't a problem with them. Your standard sized labels that any PC can print out fits neatly on them and then when you want to change the product inside, its super easy to remove the label from the glass and reapply a new one after cleaning and refilling.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Is A Truly Wonderul Oil!,This is a fantastic oil. I really feel like Tamanu oil is an unsung hero in the whole essential oils and extracts world. Tea Tree oil gets all the credit, but when it comes to skin care and anti-fungas, anti-itch or anything that remotely has to do with the skin, this oil works fantastically well. It has a great smell and soaks deep into the skin to do a really good job at soothing irritated, dry, infected skin. It also does wonders on toenails - especially those with fungus - and can be used in all sorts of ways to benefit ones' health. It works fantastically well on acne and is often a secret weapon in high end skin care products designed to fight acne. Tamanu oil possesses the ability to promote the formation of new tissue, thereby accelerating wound healing and the growth of healthy skin. You can use this on yourself, your pets, and let me tell you it works wonders on horses with flesh wounds like fence cuts etc. In the tropical isles (ie. Fiji etc), where it is found naturally, Tamanu Oil is an age old medicine used to reduce the pain of sciatica, shingles, neuralgia, rheumatism and leprous neuritis.I love this product.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Kit Has It All And Room For More!,This first aid kit absolutely blew me out of the water. The bag itself that the whole kit comes in is tough enough to stand just about any indoor or outdoor adventure you take it on. It's made of a high quality ripstop nylon that sheds dirt and is easy to clean. Its soft sides make it easy to store and its slick surface make cleaning it a breeze. The color red stands out so you have no problems identifying it even in the middle of a medical emergency. Now that's JUST the packaging. Inside, there is literally a cornucopia of help for all kinds of medical conditions. First and foremost, there's bandaging, band-aids, and little square packs for cleaning and disinfecting wounds. There's animal sting bites, a face shield for mouth-to-mouth, ace wraps, and then there's all kinds of pockets for you to add your own things like insect repellent and any prescription medications.There is a booklet within that reminds you of basic first aid. It allows you to add a few things as well since it has blank pages. There's over 80 items inside that contribute to life saving situations. Most everything is valuable in the kit, and you get a wide assortment of all types of bandages and wraps.I would go ahead and add (there is room) super glue - which is the best way to close big wounds without sewing - and suture. I'd also add a wide assortment of basic ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain relief and swelling. I'd also add some feminine products that double for both emergency female needs and first aid.Otherwise this kit has it all!

I just can't think of a more universally useful item that works.And in regards to using these containers, they keep leftovers super fresh and microwave nicely so you don't have to dirty multiple containers to reheat food.

I ran through some of my favorite songs on these headphones and heard notes and tones I'd never heard before. It was a really mindblowing experience to own these.They are comfortable in my ears.

Running a bit of liquid soap on this brush and turning it loose on my back, shoulders, neck and arms really has done the trick to clear up some back issues I was having involving breakouts. This lovely all natural brush gently cleans and gets the job done time and time again. I'm surprised at how well its held up in the shower - hanging there full time - being used daily and sometimes more than once a day. The bristles are soft yet firm and really lather up the soap just as well as one of those puffs or loofas. The added bonus is that with this brush you can reach everywhere. I don't know why I've never owned one before now. But I do know I'm super glad I picked Purelation's version. This brush is built to last and super duper beautiful. I know its something I won't hesitate to give as a gift.

However, that being said the word Frankincense comes from the word franc encens which means quality incense in old French. So that's what the majority of the world uses Frankincense for. It makes an incredibly awesome incense. You can use it in a diffuser, roll your own incense sticks using this oil as the fragrance, mix it with carrier oils for perfumes, and use it in things like bath balms and topical applications like lotions etc. Frankincense oil is a natural antiseptic, meaning it will kill bacteria and viruses from services and thus makes an excellent cleaner. Do not use it in home health recipes that would apply it to open wounds. And because of its scent, Frankincense is also used as a natural deodorizer. Natural Acres makes an incredible 10mil bottle. It's a top rate product and I highly recommend it for all the above uses.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,November 1, 2015,B010RIZJ5U,Frankincense 100% Pure Essential Oil -10ml- By: Natural Acres,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010RIZJ5U,Natural Acres,$10.19

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Holy Grail Of Emergency Devices. It Has Power For Everything, Even Your Car!,This is an amazing product. Not only will it jumpstart your car, but it will support and charge numerous devices that you might need charged in an emergency situation and on the road where there is no power I was seriously impressed with the quality of the package and the heafty size of the charger. What else impressed me was the fact that the HyperPS company includes about any sort of connection you might need to hook up a multitude of devices to this product. It tells you how much power it has at all times. It acts as an emergency roadside kit with LED lights that have three mods - high, fast, and SOS. You hold the power button down a long time to get this function to start. Speaking of lights, it acts as a flashlight too. This is literally a do-it-all safety roadside emergency kit. If I had a child going off to college and taking their car, I'd definitely outfit them with one of these. I'd also have one in EVERY vehicle I own. This goes for not only the cars, but motorcycles and boats. This is just an incredibly useful functional device that EVERYONE needs. Couple it with a first aid kit and a blanket with emergency rations and you are all ready to survive any emergency situation in your vehicle.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 17, 2015,B00VF2IC9I,2015 Model QD6 (Supporting up to 5L Petrol and 3L Diesel Vehicle) HyperPS 20000mah Multi-function Car Jump Starter Portable Mobile Laptop Power Bank Battery Charger Emergency Kit with LED Flashlight,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VF2IC9I,HyperPS,$68.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Best Diffuser I've Ever Seen Or Owned!,Let's face it. There are a million diffusers out there on the market. What makes this one different? Why I'm glad you asked! First off, Naska's Diffuser is absolutely gorgeous. It comes in a round shape that gently illuminates wherever its plugged in. Its white streamlined design really goes with almost any decor you might have where you want this diffuser to rest. It diffuses scent amazingly and has a huge water tank so it doesn't have to be refilled over and over again. That's just for starters. Then, it cycles through (or you can set it on one) sixteen different colors to add mood and atmosphere to any room where you put it. It has a 60, 90, and 120 minute timer which accounts for the huge amount of liquid it can hold. Most of my other diffusers have only had small tanks. It will run up to 10 hours on its water supply, which is a plus plus for me. Then finally, HOW you use it is important. It's simple design makes it easy to fill, set, and run without having to pull out an instruction book or have a degree in engineering to interpret. I really love this diffuser. It is by far the favorite one I own which means my others are going to go find someplace else to live. They have decidedly been REPLACED!Great job Naska.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Sharpener. Perfect For High End Art Pencils.,This is a really high end super nice pencil sharpener. I love the fact that its utterly adjustable so that you can sharpen a little or to a tiny point. I mainly use this for my Berol Prismacolor colored pencils. They are super expensive ($2 a pencil) so when I want to sharpen them I just want to take a bit of the wood off so I can use all the color I can get out of them. This sharpener is perfect for the job. It's super super super set up for the artists out there. It's quiet, fast, and easy to dump the shavings off when you are finished. I keep this sharpener on my art desk and use it allll the time.There is only one negative thing about this sharpener. And that is that it only sharpens a standard sized pencil. I would love it if it had a sort of function where I could get extra fat or extra slim art pencils in it as well.Overall, I highly recommend this product.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,September 23, 2015,B00XBQKWWQ,Premium Electric Mechanical Pencil Sharpener with Helical Blade by Merite - Heavy Duty - Battery / Electric Operated - Includes Cable & Adaptor,Office Products,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XBQKWWQ,Mérite,$29.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,The Perfect Essential Oil Perfume Base!,Traditionally Bergamot Essential Oil has been one of the leading contenders in perfumes and in mood altering scents throughout the world. Natural Acres truly delivers in its 10ml 100% pure bottle. This stuff smells delicious. I use it to refresh my house since the weather has been so bad and we've had all the windows locked down tight and it gets stuffy. I also love mixing this oil with other essential oils to create custom perfumes placed in a carrier oil and then stored in little roller bottles so I can carry them in my purse. My friends also love it when I mix essential oil perfumes for them. We actually have parties where we come together, bring new oils, and try out new scents. It's a fantastic ladies day out and a super creative use of time.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Best Flashlight And Most Poweful Flashlight I Own!,This is literally the most powerful flashlight I've ever seen and certainly the nicest one I own. This light is blinding when you turn it on full, spotlighting a crisp clear circle that really illuminates my entire property. I can see the back fenceline in a three acre pasture no problem with this item. The cute little bonus flashlight that goes on your key ring is pretty neat too. I love that this flashlight is sustainable because it comes with a rechargeable battery (that's super strong and long lasting) so you aren't wasting batteries that you have to throw away once you use them up.This flashlight is also tough. It's built almost like one of those tactical flashlights are. It's heavy duty and I've dropped it numerous times (even on cement) and never had an issue.I use this thing to walk between my house and my barn and I have never missed a step or tripped yet. I just really love this flashlight and have it at the top of my Christmas list to give to family and friends who are also out in the country and need good lighting. This flashlight will be invaluable to us all this winter when we definitely (almost on schedule) will loose power.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 12, 2015,B00VZTJVE6,Outlite E6 (Rechargeable 18650 Battery and Charger Included) 900 Lumen CREE XML T6 LED Portable Adjustable Focus Zoom Tactical handheld Flashlight, Rugged Aluminum Construction, Water Resistant Lighting Lamp Torch,For Hiking Camping Emergency,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VZTJVE6,outlite,$18.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Balm Literally Works Wonders!,I love this balm! I'm one of those people that have naturally dry flaky skin and this Wonder Balm does literally wonders for my skin. It super moisturizes it and the healing essential oils infused in the balm really have brought my scaly skin back under control and leveled out the itching and flaking. I especially have dry skin on my feet which itch like crazy when they peel. This balm has utterly stopped that, softened the heels, and has eliminated any and all itching involved. I suspect I might have mild allergies to fabric softener or certain kinds of washing machine detergent. But I've never been formally tested. This cream eliminates that need and comforts my irritated skin.Thank you Puriya for creating such a great product!

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Super Flexible Versitle Lamp That Is So Easy To Customize For Any Room!,I just remodeled my kitchen and needed a nice little white lamp to go with the white and seafoam green decor. I had a perfect spot in a slightly shadowy spot up on the elbow table of a corner breakfast nook. This lamp fit perfectly! It's absolutely adorable and when set up on a bunch of coffee-table style books about the ocean, really adds a heck of a lot of personality to my kitchen's formerly dank corner. It was super easy to assemble, had a plenty long cord to go with it, and really adds a lot of glowing soft white light to that part of the kitchen. One thing I did do to it is add a drape of sea shells from corner to corner at the top to add to my ocean theme. That's something that really appealed to me about this lamp. You could drape it, decorate it, or even stencil on it to really personalize it to your decor or home theme. That makes it a real winner in my book.I really highly recommend Lightaccent's White Wooden Table Lamp. The linen panels really add a soft glow that makes the lamp perfect for anywhere.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 20, 2015,B00P8AC348,White Wooden Table Lamp with White Linen Shade,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P8AC348,lightaccents,$19.95
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantasticly Beautiful Rug For The Price!,Unique Styles makes some totally amazing rugs. First off it was hard to choose a design because every one they did have was really gorgeous. However, I just remodeled my home and put in deep orange walls and dark flooring so I absolutely had to have these contemporary circles. The ombre effect in the patterning is not really done justice here in the photos. This rug is stunning! The materials are top rate. It does not gather dirt even though I have it in a high traffic doorway and the rug is super easy to spot clean. I clean it once a month with the steam cleaner and let it dry outside and it looks as good as new. The pile is deep without being fluffy and it just really comes off as a high end attention getting wow factor for my entryway. I'm just super pleased with this rug and plan on using Unique Styles again for my accent rugs in the future.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This is Definitely A Ten Star Razor!,This is a fantastic shaver. Creation Springs created a great product. The three rotating heads cut hair close to the skin without leaving a rash or razor burn. The charge holds for a long long time and the base stand you rest the shaver on is sturdy and durable. This is a super high end razor that really follows the contours of your face. I also tested this on my legs and actually loved it. I know its not designed to be that type of razor but when you are really honestly testing a product, you put it through its paces. My husband loves this razor too. He is the type that has super sensitive skin and found this gentle even on his face. Because of his sensitivity, he doesn't shave daily but instead does so every few days or else he wears red bumps around on his skin and sports a razor burn or rash routinely. This Creation Springs Razor doesnt' cause that. It works well in the shower or dry, so shaving cream kits are no problem for it.I just really love this razor. Its by the far the nicest electric I've owned or used.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Heart Health And Brain Suppliment!,I was shocked at the size of this bottle! It has 400 capsules of goodness all nestled within its enormous depths. Fish oil is super important to me because it assists incredibly well with memory loss, inattention, and sharpness of thinking. It's also super fantastic for cutting back inflammation. And even beyond that it helps with your heart health and decreases stroke risk. What's not to love about that? Nutriden does a fantastic job with its OMega 3 Fish Oil Pills.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Set! A must have for every camper!,On so many levels I wish that I would have had this product times four to share with some of my best camping buddies.

You get two pots, one of which turns out to be a frying pan while the other can be manipulated to act as a general saucepan. Then you get two cups, one ladle and a free item that turns out to be a wilderness survival saw.The whole set is heat proof, folds up to almost nothing, and is really easy to clean.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Lovely Bath Sponge. Tough. Great Exfoliator.,Great Bath sponge! I like that its doughnut shaped and easy to grip. It's guaranteed to not unravel and so far I've had no issues with it trying to do so. It does a great job foaming up the bath gel I use and getting my skin clean and exfoliated. I got mine in purple, but truthfully I would have rather gotten pink. This sponge is so fantastic that's really the only criticism I can offer. I wish The Crown Choice would allow us a COLOR CHOICE when ordering. I think children would also love this in brighter colors than pastels.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Super Cute And Super Functional!,If you are like me, most of your social life occurs around a bonfire in the summer. There are just certain tools you need to have to keep the crowd happy. California Home Goods really hit a home run with this set of Roasting Forks. Why? Well first off they are absolutely adorable. They are long, sturdy, and made of stainless steel. They have colorful adorable handles that helps folks keep which fork belongs to whom straight. They are super easy to clean (dishwasher safe, hand washing, etc) and you finally get enough in the set to deal with a whole group of people or a large family. That's pretty awesome in my opinion since just about every other company out there offering these sorts of items offers them in pairs or sets of four. I really like California Home Goods and their line of products because you can tell real people, not a mindless huge corporation, are behind the items they sell.Some bonuses to the set include little hangers on the ends of the forks so they can be hung up near a bonfire area and a draw string for easy travel in case people go to outdoor summer events. There's just nothing to critique about this set of Roasting Forks. They get an A+++++ in my book and I really enjoy mine. I've used them for marshmallows, wieners (hahah I love it when I get to say wiener in a review!) and banana boats. If you don't know what a banana boat is, your missing out on all kinds of summer desert fun. These Roasting Forks are a definite MUST HAVE for the summer enthusiast.Thanks California Home Goods!

I was so excited when I took this out of the box because its really made of metal that's been powder coated with enamel paint and really built heavy duty! I love how its interchangeable with so many citrus fruits and the device itself is easy to set up to accommodate almost fruit any of that family. I immediately got a bundle of lemons from Cosco for a family gathering I wanted to make fresh squeezed lemonade at, and woah did this juicer really perform. I went through all ten lemons' in about five minutes just doing a half at a time. I had a whole huge keg of Lemonade with minimal effort and no hand fatigue or issues about not being strong enough to juice my lemons. This worked fantastically. Here's my secret recipe. 1 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice (from about 10 lemons) 1 cup superfine sugar 2 cups waterJust don't forget to slice some lemons to decorate your lemonade with.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Curler. It's Super Functional And An Exceptional Color!,I have several eyelash curlers, but this is by and large my best one. I love the fact that the company includes so many replacement pads because lets face it, by the time you get your eyelash pad worn out, you've forgotten where you bought the curler or who it was from (unless it was well marked). Because its super hot pink, I have zero problem finding it when I'm looking and enjoy just leaving it out on my counter for easy access. I love the spooly/brush that comes with it as well as the mascara shield. The learning curve on holding up the mascara shield was a bit tough on me, but I did eventually (after a week and lots of patience) figure out how to hold it, my mascara wand, and see what I was doing all at the same time.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Thank you Easy Posture. I literally was on the verge of ...,This product was a lifesaver! My husband pulled a muscle in his back and couldn't hardly sit anywhere without his back giving him fits and literally the toughest man I know screaming in pain. The very first day I got this I stuck it behind his back on the couch near his lumbar region and finally for the first time in two days he relaxed and breathed a sigh of relief. Of course he wouldn't go to the doctor or chiropractor so it was this or nothing and this really gave him the ability to relax until his muscle healed. Thank you Easy Posture. I literally was on the verge of konking him over the head and hauling him unconscious into the ER before I bought this item and gave it a try. It works! Now, I'm sure it wasn't designed for instant relief to injury, but that's what we got out of it. And now it lives on the couch, in his office in his office chair, in the kitchen in his kitchen chair... bottom line is I need to order more of these. They work! They are fantastic. And really when you are in that much pain, instant relief without pain pills, muscle relaxants, and an expensive chiropractor is invaluable.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 17, 2015,B013U63OLW,Lumbar Support Cushion for Office Chair by Easy Posture &#x2605; Memory Foam Back Support for Chairs &#x2605; Double Adjustable Straps to Keep Back Cushion in Place &#x2605; Breathable Mesh Fabric,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013U63OLW,Easy Posture,$29.95
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Beekeeper Approved!,This is a super important product. Mee Beauty and Purely Mee, Inc are desperately trying to raise awareness about the vanishing of the honeybees. They donate 1% of all their sales (which can add up considerably) to awareness and research of this problem. As a fellow beekeeper I really appreciate this and support this endeavor 100%. That being said, this cream is fantastic. I use it on my dry sun-abused hands and it softens them right up. Its top ingredient is Aloe, unlike most lotions that have a majority ingredient as water.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Gorgeous Table Cloth! Well Made And Beautifully Patterened In Thick Embossed Fabric!,I just remodeled my kitchen and put in white cabinets. I also repainted everything in a nice seafoam greenish blue color and put in dark stained floors. I decorated the entire kitchen with beauty in mind hanging sea scapes and seaglass ornaments. It's super pretty and classic. Then I put in a white breakfast nook and ordered this lovely table cloth to protect it. I'm so super impressed with HLC.ME's products! This table cloth is heavy duty, absolutely gorgeous, and super washable. I looked at the big box chain stores and couldn't find anything remotely like this. I got the size, color, and shape I wanted. And it just really put the finishing touches on my room and set off my table decorations nicely.If you need a tablecloth, please consider this one. There's nothing bad I can point out about it.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Conditioner. I Use It As A Comb-Out Aid and Detangler Too!,Caju has a wonderful product in this Leave In Conditioner And Keratin Hair Mask! I have long thick hair that's prone to frizz and to breaking off if I over condition it or if I don't condition it at all. So far, Caju's conditioner has been fantastic! I use it on my still wet hair and put a little on a huge brush and brush it through my hair. It smooths my tangled mess, helping it detangle and to comb out nicely. Then, once its fully dried, my hair doesn't have the flyaways it normally does without this conditioner. This Caju Conditioner also leaves my hair with a wonderful scent and a brilliant shine that is really noticable. People have asked me what I like to use on my hair and I must have shared the link to this product a dozen times since I purchased it.I really highly recommend this conditioner.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great For Facial Hair!,It definitely is face torture, just like the eiplady was leg torture but that being said, this facial hair remover works quickly, pulls the hair fast so the torture is over quickly, and nothing grows back for a long long time. It's WELL worth the pain (seconds worth) for weeks of no unsightly facial hair. It also removes peach fuzz and all kinds of stubborn hair - even the little whispies that grow around the hairline. I really like this product even though I won't lie and say it isn't painful. It is. But as long as you go in knowing that your going to pull most of your hair at once it beats the heck out of tweazing and plucking and torturing yourself for hours. Give it a try.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Nicest Pruner's I've Ever Owned!,Being a lifelong gardener, you come across tools you love every once in a while and then you use them and care for them as one would precious jewelry because they are so special to you. These Ratchet Pruning Shears are just such a tool. They cut through little things easily, but tackle even bigger issues quite nicely as well. I have a weeping pussy willow that grows like a weed. I use these every month or so on the willow and keep it tame. I have also used it to prune shrubs, small branches off trees, and take down all sorts of things in the yard. They grip my hand and feel utterly comfortable to use. I do recommend lightly oiling them after use to keep them nice and clean and free of dirt and rust free.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Handles!,These are great handles. We've been looking for some to use for a few different things, but especially with some of our exercise bands and yoga straps. Sometimes I have problems holding into just a thin band or a strap, so these handles give you an added grip, especially if you suffer from something like carpel tunnel or arthritis. As for the handles themselves, they work really well in all kinds of things. I've even used thet o snap my lunge lines too when working with some of my bigger draft horses. They give me a better grip.In terms of manufacturing, these handles are strong, well made, and heavily stitched. The handles are flexible rubber coated with foam and that makes them comfortable and easy to grip even when you are sweaty. i highly recommend these handles for all sorts of things. I've even borrowed them to attach to heavy lift straps to move huge pots outside the house.I love them!I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 21, 2015,B013XGJWIS,Ignite Fitness Ultra Heavy Duty Elite Exercise Handles (Pair) with Solid ABS Cores, Comfortable Extra Wide Foam Grips, Seamless O Rings - Perfect Resistance Band Handles for Crossfit and Bodybuilding,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013XGJWIS,Ignite Fitness,$12.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Best & Cutest ToolKit For The Home Out there!,This is seriously the best toolkit ever for a gift or even just a treat for yourself. It's one of those 'one of a kind' novelty things that you can actually keep laying around because its so incredibly useful. The tools inside are exactly the type of thing you need around the house. First though, before we dive into the tools, lets talk about the caddy car toolkit itself. It's ADORABLE. I mean, there's not a guy in the house or on the planet (and a lot of us girls too) that won't gravitate towards this and pick it up just out of curiosity. It's stylish, tough enough your little kid could toss it around a bit and not worry about breaking it, and not anything embarrassing to say park on the bookshelf in plain view of any visitors. That is, incidentally, where mine lives now.It has an incredibly bright absolutely adorable flashlight on the outside of the car and a handle that lets you easily hold it. It takes 4 AA batteries to run and is super bright! No more searching through a drawer looking for a loose flashlight for me! I have my little Katzco Car Toolkit parked on the shelf where I can always find it and not worry about it getting misplaced or lost. And its cute enough to go with my decor. Plus, people automatically pick it up and ask about it. And that's when I get to show them whats inside.Now... Katzco Supplies is uber smart. They know what you need exactly inside the house within easy reach. So next lets talk about the latch that keeps it closed so you can carry it by the handle and not worry about the toolkit popping open and spilling stuff everywhere. It's really really sturdy and tough! I checked it out closely before I let anyone else see it... 51 pickumup isn't my favorite game. But I had no worries. Katzco had already thought of that evidently. So feel free to tote the little car around with confidence!Now... to the meat and bones. The tools! This set comes with one of those universal handles that you fit all kinds of bits into. It has a standard grey handle that has 11 Bits with it. The bits are all standard with a few of the rarer types like small star (great for tightening down dashboards etc) and a few other little unique heads. There's a set of 8 sockets plus an adapter that fits the handle. Then you get four of those micro screwdrivers that you use for taking apart electronics. You get a set of allen wrenches that I had to use almost immediately because I was putting a new bistro table together and the factory that put the screws in a baggie inside of it forgot to add the Allen wrench. My little car Toolkit was helping out even on its first day here. Then, and finally, the most important thing it has is a set of small needle nose pliars! These things are lifesavers. I really enjoy this item and can't say enough fantastic about it. Give it a try... you won't be sorry!I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 20, 2015,B015GKQCUA,Katzco 34 Piece Car Hardware Toolkit with Light, Great for Christmas Gift,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015GKQCUA,Katzco Supplies,$22.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,It Works Wonders!,My dog really responds to this whistle. I'm not sure why I haven't gotten one before. But this whistle really does work. My dog responds well to it. I use it for various functions, namely though to call him back home (we don't have a fenced yard - just pasture all around) when I let him out of the house to use the pasture. Sometimes, before the whistle, I'd have to call and call him. Now I can just use the whistle and he response wonderfully well to it. It's sound carries much further than my voice and it saves me from going hoarse when I try to call him and there's other noises such as rain, cars on the road, or the mooing of cows.I've used it in place of clicker training a bit too and now he can stand on the porch and watch the UPS guy drop off boxes without getting upset or barking because I'll just grab the whistle and give it a few gentle toots and he comes and sits by me ignoring visitors and people on the porch!Basically, if I were an actual dog trainer, I know this whistle would do me well. But since I'm not and just an average citizen with a dog, my uses are limited to calling him and reassuring him using it. Those two things have done wonders though to improve my dog life. So I really highly recommend this whistle even if your just an average person like me. It works, my dog enjoys it, and it helps us communicate better.I received this whistle at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 8, 2015,B00YB9YKFW,Smarter Pet® Premium Dog Whistle to Stop Barking - With Lanyard & Anti-loss Cover | Safest Dog Obedience, Repellent, and Training Aid | Easy to Use | 100% Money Back Guarantee | Lifetime Warranty,Pet Supplies,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YB9YKFW,Smarter Pet,$9.97
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,My Husband Loves This! He Was Super Excited To Get This As A Gift!,I honestly don't know much about these hydration bladders. However, I ordered this product for my husband who does a lot of long treks outdoors and is into competitive survival and cross-counry sports of all types. He loves this hydration bladder. He states its easy to fill, clean, and sip from as hes hiking along. The design allows it to be tucked into any manner of backpack and the hose is long enough to reach where he can easily access it to have himself a drink without stopping. Coupled with a filtered pump to make water out of streams and creeks completely safe, he states this is the perfect outdoor survival combination. I'm so glad he loves it.One hint he did suggest was that when you order stuff that comes with the little dehumidifier packets, to save those packets and completely dry out this bladder. Then when you store it, tuck a few of those packets into the bladder (remembering to remove them before you use it) to keep it dry and free of any sort of mold or mildew.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 5, 2015,B015DWNI80,Sunnytrip Horn Hydration Bladder 105 Oz/3-litre, Bent Mousepiece for Easy Water Drinking, New Design, Durable Built, Odorless, Best for Hiking, Cycling, Training, Hydro Backpack,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015DWNI80,SunnyTrip,$20.90
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantastic Tool Set. I've Used It For More Than My Bike! It Was A Lifesaver On Mail Order "Some Assembly Required" Furniture!,This kit has proven invaluable for me! I am a cyclist and enjoy my mountain bike enormously - which is why I got this kit - but in recent times I've been remodeling my living room unexpectedly and in doing so I replaced a lot of furniture and decor. Many of these things I shipped from Amazon and other websites were that dreaded 'some assembly required'. Yea. Ever had the situation happen where the Alan Wrench they included wasn't the right size? I have. I have used these bike tools more on furniture than I have on my bike! If I hadn't have had them, I would have been in a world of hurt. I'm just glad it had the sizes and odd headed tools I needed. I could have hugged WOTOW! Seriously, thanks guys!I also, to be fair, did go out and tighten some spokes and dink around with my tool on my bike. It worked fine. I haven't yet had to change a tire or so any sort of really serious repair. But when I do, I know I'm going to have the right tools. I already added this tool back to my little handle-bar bag where I keep some of my bike eq (batteries for lights, etc) and stash my helmet.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,September 13, 2015,B0132W5MQE,WOTOW 11in1 Mountain Cycle Bicycle Folding Tool Set Bike Multi-function Repair Tool Kit Allen Wrench Screwdriver Chain Cutter Hex Key with 3 Tire Pry Bars Rods (Blue),Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0132W5MQE,WOTOW,$8.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,A Wedding Day Lifesaver!,This is a fantastic little sewing kit. It really has it all for the emergency repair on the road. I was recently helping a good friend with her wedding and litterally used just about every feature in this sewing kit for emergency repairs and last minute modifications. The flower girl's hair piece kept slipping so I went ahead and sewed it to her braid. We fixed a tiny tear in the train which happened getting out of the limo after the wedding but before the reception. I also used it on myself to tack up a hemline that came loose on some poorly stitched maid of honor dress. I'm just super impressed at this kit and am really thankful I had it with me for my really good friend's most important day. It literally has all the colors of thread you might need, super sharp scissors, needles, and everything in between (pins, needle threaders, measuring tape, etc) so it will really save the day.I received this kit at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 12, 2015,B00RZXODW6,Sewing Aid - Emergency Sewing Kit in Stylish Pu Leather Case - Useful for Home, Travel, Office, Dorm Room & Camping - Great Gift for Adults, Beginners & Kids - Free Bonus E-book Included,Arts, Crafts & Sewing,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RZXODW6,Land of Qantu,$7.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Works Great For Both Hammocks and Hammock Chairs!,I've been looking for these since I started enjoying hammocks. I know they are designed for Hammock Chairs, which I have, but I also noticed how nicely these hold up hammocks themselves. Ideally I need about five of these... a set of two for each hammock I own (total of two) and one for my hammock chair. I love the weight limit on this because a couple people and a dog or two piling in a hammock can easily overrun the weight limit on normal hooks. I love the smooth swivel and the fact it keeps your hammocks from tangling so badly, especially the chairs. The clasp is big enough too that you can fit all the various hooks in its jaws. Cravegreens did a really great job on this product and its one I really need to turn around and order a few more of.I received this Hammock Chair Swivel Hook for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Is A Dream Handle For Campers!,I just recently replaced a lot of my cookware with cast iron. I had no idea that these Hot Handle Holders existed. Crucible Cookware makes a completely awesome product when you are dealing with cast iron. I go horse camping a lot and 99% of the cookware we pack in is cast iron. I took this handle with me the last time and absolutely loved it. Its the prefect size to fit almost universally on all my frying pans and my flat flapjack pans. I got such nice compliments from people over them as well. This handle holder is so functional that I need to pick up a few more. I even appreciated the color because it was easy to find if accidentally dropped in a campsite situation. I would love to see Crucible Cookware put out a different type of grip for dutch ovens and grabbing the lids off of a similar type pot.I have nothing bad to say about this product.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Great Advancement In Facial Hair Removal!,This is a tiny little torture device that women will LOVE to use. I always hate getting out the tweezers and tweezing sensitive spots on my face.... chin, lip, and the the tiny fine hairs around my ears. But the whole tweezing is a necessary part of being a girl. If you don't.. it's just ewh. This Facial Hair Remover does a darn fine job of replacing a tweezer and the prolonged torture of tweezing. Don't get me wrong... it hurts. It hurts like heck because its in essence a large coil of wire that captures the hair and yanks it out of your face. That being said, that's exactly what your tweezers do. And this way with Merite's tool, it gets done all at once and its utterly over with. I like it. Honestly, its better and its a facial advancement if any are possible in this day and age. It takes no time to use... just hold it in either hand, bend it into a horse-shoe shape, and run it over your face. It reminds me of a micro Epilady. :)I recommend this product.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Hori Hori Knife Cuts My Bulb Planting Time By About 90%,This is the PERFECT knife for any bulb enthusiast. When its time to put the bulbs in the ground - especially tulips, daffodils, and crocus' - you want something like this to make your job SUPER EASY!. No more digging, measuring, eyeballing, guestimating, etc. With the Hori Hori Knife you plunge it into the ground at the proper depth ( which is clearly marked on the blade ), give it a sharp twist, place your bulb in the space created, and then gently pull the knife out of the ground. It takes less time than it takes to inhale deeply. I plant hundreds of tulips this time of year (and garlic, etc) so this makes my job so much easier and cuts my time by about 90%. It used to take me as long to plant bulbs as it did to prep beds for winter for the bulbs to come up in the spring. No longer true! With this knife, the hard work is done.Now that being said, lets talk about the construction. This knife is tough! Its built to be one of those tools you pass on to your kids. It also comes with a hefty sheath so you can clip it onto your gardeners belt, and never look back. I just love this product.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,I Highly Recommend These Poles!,These poles are amazingly well built and perfect for the very active hiker. I started using a set of poles years ago when I was out surveying streams and had to carry a depth staff. I soon learned how nice it was to have a long sturdy pole to feel my way forward and get extra balance when traversing streams or really unsteady footing like rock falls or slippery moss. Since that time I've always had at least one pole, sometimes two, when I'm out hiking. When I was given an opportunity to review these poles, I jumped on it because I knew I could give them a really great test. I'm 6'4&#34;, about 240, and these poles adjusted up tall enough for me and took my weight just fine when I leaned heavily on them. That makes them incredibly stellar in my mind! These Trekking poles are TOP OF THE LINE. They really have great grips, are easy to adjust, and sturdy enough to get a hiker safely through the woods.I've taken these on flat ground, swampy ground, hilly areas, and even a steep hike. I've crossed streams, log jams, and brush wacked. These poles hold up! I highly highly recommend them.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 9, 2015,B0156RY2AA,DENALI Trekking Poles By Denali Outdoor Gear - 1 Pair of Anti-Shock Durable Aluminum Poles for Hiking Walking Trekking.,Sports & Outdoors,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0156RY2AA,Denali Outdoor Gear,$34.99
Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,4,Great Cream. It Has Its Pluses And Minuses!,First off, there are things I love about this cream and there are things I absolutely hate about it. I am, however, giving it four stars because it actually does what it says its going to do and really does a great job healing your skin. I picked it up for my harsh dried chapped elbows. They've been utterly abused due to house construction, remodel, and yardwork. No one loves icky elbows and to boot I had dried chapped heels (from running barefoot all summer) to boot that actually matched my elbows. I tried this cream and it worked as promised, smoothing and soothing my elbows and heels, restoring them to the perfect buttery soft condition they should be in. That being said, there are two things about this cream I really can't stand. I can get past them due to the healing effect, but I really want people to understand and expect this when ordering this product.First and foremost, the color. This cream looks like the consistency of a yellowish green sludge reminiscent of finely purred pea soup. This is not appetizing, but then again you won't have to worry about a child trying to eat it. Secondly it smells like cannabis, which to me is sickly sweet. People might like that smell, but I do not enjoy it. Of all the things in this cream (and its packed full of goodness), nothing overpowers this scent and it dominates the entire cream. To me, this is something that I don't want to go around smelling like... so I only use it after work but before I shower.So, that's my take on this cream. It's decent, works fantastic, but the smell and appearance is hard to get around. I did test it for staining on white fabric and so far so good, no plain white T was harmed in the testing of this product. That's a bonus as well.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,October 13, 2015,B015X39HDY,Best Psoriasis Treatment, Eczema Treatment And Rosacea Treatment Balm.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,This Is A FANTASTIC Picnic Blanket. Perfect In Every Way!,I have a tree outside my home that's a huge evergreen. I have smaller trees, but this big evergreen is my favorite and I've had a blanket for ages that I take outside to sit under the tree and write. It's one of my most relaxing activities. The only problem is the evergreen sheds needles and the needles can play devil on my washing machine and get trapped not only in the pump but in the drain lines. I shake that blanket out good, but it still can't help but have trapped needles in it. That's when I ordered the Zen Formosa All Purpose Durable Outdoor Picnic Blanket.First off, it has a smooth underside that provides a moisture barrier from the damp ground AND keeps you from having all sorts of things like pine needles and leaves stick ot it. You simply brush it off when you go to fold it up, and its clean. The green plaid I ordered is lovely under my tree and gives me and anyone who wants to join me ample space to lounge around outside. I particularly love how large this blanket is. I also enjoy how easy it is to fold up and store.Really, this is just simply the most perfect blanket ever for picnicing. I'd really rather give it ten stars out of five than five out of five. It totally deserves them.I received this blanket at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. That being said its FANTASTIC! Don't hesitate to order it. It's easy to clean, durable, easy to fold, and super portable.

Bookwyrm,A2LKBVKUBWOVS2,5,Fantastic Torch. My Hubby Loves It. He Uses It In The Kitchen And To Repair Pipes! Shhhhh!,This Culinary Torch is a powerhouse of torches. I own several and this one is far and wide my favorite. First, it holds a lot of fuel, has a big sturdy grip that fits my big hands better than most torches, and has a built in stand so the bottom doesn't ever pop off of it like happens to some of my torches. This one also has a super adjustable flame that goes from very tiny and tight to big and impressive - perfect for large Creme Brulee. I feel like this is one of those torches that would have any guy doing an impression of Tim the tool man Taylor from Tool Time and grunting with satisfaction at the power and sheer impressiveness of this torch. All that translates into this is a heavy duty professional culinary tool and its nothing to mess with.I even hate to admit this, but my husband grabbed it from the kitchen when he couldn't get his pipe torch started when he was doing a bit of repair on our water pipes outside. He used it to melt the PVC to get a fitting off and replaced it. Don't tell the manufacturer of this torch though. They might not like the fact that its soo versatile. Your man will love it too.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,History Buff's Dream Come True,This book and its companion, 1491 by the same author, were near the top of my teen daughter's wish list, right behind the electronics. When we sat down to unwrap gifts, she had to stop unwrapping, hold the books up, and explain exactly why they were so fascinating. She says it is a particularly fertile period in the history of the world, and demonstrates the significant impact that European colonization of the Americas has made in a way that is clear and easy to understand.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,December 31, 2014,0307278247,1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307278247,Vintage,$10.08

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,2,Sexist Stereotypes Dwarf Mystery,This is 1.5 stars rounded up. No, no, and no.I received this DRC free from Brash Books in exchange for an honest review.I was attracted to this mystery, which is set in West Virginia, because it has the novel element of hunters that use falcons, in addition to white Supremacist bad guys known as the Stonewall Ranger Brigade. And it started out as a promising read, with detective Frank Pavlicek and his former Navy Seal partner, Jake Toronto, looking to find out who shot Chester Carew in the back, leaving him dead on his own land. The birds of prey stand as metaphors for Pavlicek and Toronto, who will now hunt the killers as cold quarry in order to exact justice.Who was to expect, then, that the entire novel would be riddled with blantant sexism, with only one positive depiction of a female? It is this one redemptive moment that saved this mystery from a one star rating, a rating I save for the illiterate and the blatantly offensive.Before I explain further about the stereotyping of women in this work, I should also mention that the N word is used twiceonce by a bad guy, once by a more complex figureand our hero is known to have shot and killed a young African-American man when he was a cop. We are told this was a righteous shooting that gives our hero terrible nightmares nevertheless.What timing.But back to the women. Because I wanted to enjoy this bookwho picks up a murder mystery without wanting some escapist enjoyment?I withheld judgment until the 75 percent mark, and even then I read the whole thing to see whether there would be some sly move in which the sexist behaviors of the main characters were called out, or in which the protagonist found himself reflecting that hed misjudged some women and situations. But the entire narrative was loaded with it, not just the main characters dialogue and behaviors, so I didnt think it was likely, and in the end, there was only one good moment for a female character, and the rest were endless cliches.We have Betty in her apron (Its all right, Ill just be in the kitchen); nutcase bar owner Roswell Parker; seductive reporter Kara Grayson, who goes to pieces during a violent scene in which she was not injured.You stay here with the woman  Frank tells Jake.Kara tends to an injured animal, and when the dust has settled the two menfolk rush out to save the world while A female sergeant had also arrived and seen to it that Kara Grayson and the German Shepherd were taken care of.We often hear of women that occupy professional positions; we just never see them do their jobs, or if they do, they mess it up. Federal agent Colleen Briggs is one such character, and everyone feels great when she is openly dissed by the deputy sheriff, since she is a robotic clone of a federal agent.Pavlicek has a grown daughter whos out of state doing some work for him online, but when he gets her on the phone she pouts, and he tells her, You let me worry about that, honey.Chester Carews son Jason is just old enough to read The Cat in the Hat, but he is old enough to protect his mother, who is helpless, apparently.(Remember Betty? In the kitchen?) Pavlicek gets her permission to speak to her son alone, but he doesnt tell her what the kid knows or what the kid has seen. And the kid doesnt want her to know.We meet Jake Torontos girlfriend, who is an attorney, but when we run into her at home, she is cradling a baby. Franks daughter Nicole, who has arrived in town, takes time for the appropriate oohing and ahhing over the baby, and then follows her father and Priscilla into where else? The kitchen. At this pointand I dont want to give a spoiler, so Ill use broad strokesFrank needs to take care of something for Jake that Jake isnt available to do, and this includes getting confidential material out of the house. Priscilla is concerned because Jake keeps that door locked; of course she wouldnt have a key, right? But Jake does. When his daughter asks what is in there, he says, Its just Jakes little office.Priscilla does help, though, by getting Just, um, some personal stuff I already knew about in the bedroom she looked at Nicole and the two of them giggled.Oh, but it isnt over yet. Not by a far sight. Priscillas hands were dwarfed by Jakes shotgun, so of course, Frank took it from her.It occurs to me during all this that since Priscilla iswe are toldan attorney, perhaps Frank is protecting her professional credibility by having her not know some things, or else maybe Jake was, but the word attorney is mentioned just once and never comes into play again.We have a number of promiscuous women, all of whom are morally compromised. We have lazy nurses. And in a confrontation with bad guys, the uglies hurl the ultimate insult and Frank and Jake by calling them little girls.Excuse me now. I am going back to my DRC of Gloria Steinems memoir. I need something to read that will remind me that women are worthy of dignity and respect.If your ideas about gender are lodged in the 1950s, by all means, get this book, and have a real good time.As for me: no more Andy Straka!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 18, 2015,194129877X,A Cold Quarry: A Frank Pavlicek Mystery (Frank Pavlicek Mystery Series),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/194129877X,Brash Books,$12.53
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Taut Edgar-Nominated Thriller Now Available Digitally,Jerry Lind is missing, which is especially strange, given that he knows he is about to inherit a small fortune. It seems unlikely that he would take off for a long time without letting someone know about it. He ought to be back by now. Moreover, the next people in line to inherit his share are also wondering if he is okay. Not that they hope he isnt. Of course not! And at this point I have to break my narrative to let you know that I was fortunate enough to get this DRC free, courtesy of Net Galley and Brash Books. It was previously published in the 1980s and is just now being released digitally.Back to Jerry. No, never mind, forget him for a minute. Lets talk about our assassin.Our assassin is not getting any younger, and his wife is exhausted from all the moves. Every time he carries out a contract, they have to either abandon their stuff or get a truck, and over years and years of professional killing, it wears a woman down. She wants a garden. From now on, he needs to either make do with the significant amount hes squirreled away from his successful if messy business, or hes going to have to gosh darn hide the bodies.Its the least he can do for her.Jack Lynch is our man. Jerrys sister hires him to go to Barracks Cove, where Jerry was supposed to be running a professional errand, and see if he cant track him down. And Lynch goes in prepared. If you are sick of reading wussy narratives that give flimsy reasons for the intrepid sleuth not to carry a gun and make sure he has bullets, this is your guy, and this is your story. Has he ever fired that thing? Oh yes. But not just for practice in the line of duty? Again, oh well yes.And its a good thing, as it turns out.By the time the thing is over, a great deal of action has taken place, and though I am a six-to-eight book-at-a-time reader, the urgent, taut narrative (reminiscent somewhat of the Richard Stark detective novels from about the same period) grabbed me by the front of my shirt and held me there until the last page was turned.It was nominated for an Edgar, and the clever juggling of setting and character development, along with a plot line that is unbelievably lean and compelling, will probably leave you wondering, as it did me, why he was denied and just who exactly did get it.The consolation?

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Excellent Value for Basic Cotton Sheet,This is nothing fancy, but it's a good basic cotton sheet, a good value. We have a guest room and use it for international students. If my student is not returning at the end of the school year, I like to start the next student off with a brand new, clean bottom sheet. It makes them feel better. Since cost is an issue, they aren't going to have 600 thread count Egyptian cotton, but they are going to get something that is not rough, scratchy, or seedy looking. The sheet went on the brand new twin mattress set without a hitch; it was a little long, and so we tucked it in just a bit. The elastic all the way around made it harder to figure out which way the sheet goes on, but the reinforced stitching at the corners should help keep the sheet usable for some time to come. (We have other twin beds in the house and will wash this one with bleach and reuse it when the student leaves.) So to sum up:* all cotton* sturdy, reinforced corners*elastic all round*washes up nicely*bleachable*great value,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 13, 2015,B00BLWEWKA,Egyptian Comfort 100% Combed Cotton FITTED SHEET - Premium Quality Long Staple Fiber - Hypoallergenic, Breathable, Durable & Comfortable - Deep Pocket, Hotel Quality By Utopia Bedding (Twin, White),Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLWEWKA,Utopia Bedding,$13.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Wry, Vintage, Cozy; Hey, What Else You Gonna Read?,The cops said Chester killed himself. The gun was there, and he had powder burns on his head, powder on his hand. Everything tested out right. But hed ordered himself a brand new bicycle just two hours earlier. Does a suicide do that? And then there was the very lovely wife that had been to see Cooperman, our detective protagonist, just before the unfortunate event, concerned that her man had perhaps been unfaithful. Shes caught him lying to her, and that makes a lady suspicious.These things leave a guy like Cooperman with questions. True, hes not a cop: Me? Im just a peeper. Divorce is my meat and potatoes. But when something stinks, its in Coopermans nature to go find the source of the smell and air it out. And when others die after Chester, it makes Cooperman, whos nobodys fool, ask even more questions.I received the DRC for this vintage novel, now available digitally, from Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media. It became available for sale August 24, so you can get it now.Engel is an experienced writer, and as he plays the thread out, with murder upon murder integrated deftly into the everyday life of Benny Cooperman, he strikes an excellent balance, building suspense and driving the plot forward with the occasional humorous reflection to keep things from becoming too ugly to be fun for the reader. And his character descriptions are particularly memorable, as with this local politician:He was a big man by anybodys scale. His face looked like a roast beef dinner with all the trimmings, with a huge portion of nose in the middle. There were a couple of moments when the predictable occurred, but it wasnt so dead obviousexcuse the punas to be an eye-roller. Rather, I experienced the satisfaction of having seen it coming and been right. And to me, as long as there isnt too much of it, and there wasnt, that is a sign that the writer has been fair to his audience. There are no sudden introductions of new characters during the last ten percent of the novel that change the solution in a way impossible to predict, and a lot of us like working the puzzle as we read. There are a couple of sexist referencesthe kind of girl, bimbothat were commonly used in 1980 when this was first published that I didnt care for, but they were infrequent enough that I was able to make a note to myself, and then continue to read and enjoy the story. In the end, the wry humor and up-tempo plot line makes this one a winner.Although there are vague sexual references and infidelity is part of the plot, there is no graphic sex that should prevent a parent of a precocious adolescent mystery maven from handing the book down once they have finished it themselves. Its hard to call any story that contains multiple murders a cozy mystery, but this one is in or near that ballpark.Altogether a satisfying read.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 28, 2015,B010N004DY,The Suicide Murders (The Benny Cooperman Mysteries Book 1),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010N004DY,Open Road Media Mystery & Thriller,$6.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Good Purchase if You Have the Skills to Assemble,If you are not mechanically inclined and are going to assemble this yourself, order something else. Happily for me, I have an engineer in the house. After reading other reviews, I considered him my hole card, so to speak, because I didn't want to pony up for more expensive furniture, and I knew that if the pieces that make up the dresser are well made, he would be able to negotiate assembly and hardware issues. And he did. Took him awhile and a fair amount of cursing, and he had to get tools out that aren't listed in the directions... but once he got it put together, the drawers slide nicely, the furniture is level on the floor, and it looks attractive. It is just three drawers, and you can read the product dimensions listed. (If you can't see them on your phone, get to a laptop or desktop computer and you'll find them.) This would not be enough storage space if it weren't for the fact that there's a full closet in the room also, and we left it empty for the long-term guest to use. Figure that this dresser will hold underwear and either bras or undershirts; socks; and a small supply of tee shirts or the like. Maybe a couple pair of jeans.For our purposes and given our limited space, I would buy this dresser again.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 13, 2015,B002V9HVE6,South Shore Libra Collection 3-Drawer Chest, White,Furniture & Decor,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V9HVE6,South Shore,$59.96
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Pretty Good; Nothing Special,I needed to train a lovely Japanese wisteria onto a trellis. This was complicated a little by the fact that the plant had been killed by inexpert landscaping, then surprised me by popping back up...right in the middle of another plant. I wanted to train the vine away from the plant it was strangling in an effort to save both.The jury is out as to whether my project will succeed, but these clips are pretty good. My only reservation is that even the smallest sized ones are so large that I suspect that my vine could just climb right back out of it. It's mostly a matter of aligning the clips and trellis to where the plant will naturally cooperate, I guess.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 3, 2015,B003HNW4HO,20pc Gentle Plant & Flower Clips for Supporting Stems,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HNW4HO,Industrial Tools,$5.20
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Behind the Scenes Look at Clash Between Two Abrasive Heads of State,All of a sudden, everybody is writing a book about or featuring Richard Nixon. Having grown up during the Watergate era, I voraciously attack anything and everything apart from the most blatant apologists work. This title, in which Nixons relationship with the government of Australia and in particular, Gough Whitlam, who became Australian prime minister during the Nixon administration, is examined, seemed like a good diversion from what I usually read. Like many Americans, I tend to focus too exclusively on matters having to do with the USA. It probably has to do with the size of the country and consequently, the sheer weight of available material on matters closest to home. But I knew next to nothing about Australias government, apart from their participation as an Allied force in World War II and their status as a friendly government to the US and Britain, so I dove in.Thank you to Net Galley and Melbourne University Press for the galley, which I received free in exchange for an honest review.Between the titles subheading and the books cover, which shows Gough speaking and Nixon looking furious, one might almost conclude that the two nations were on the brink of a shooting war with one another. Not so, not so. Yet the antagonism that sprung up between the two nations during a time when both had outspoken and sometimes abrasive leaders is unquestionable. There were two primary realms of disagreement that went beyond mere personality issues. One was the role of Australia in relation to the USA, and the other was the future of Asia in relation to both countries and in general.Before reading Currans biography, I had never thought of Australia as an Asian nation. I sort of considered them to be out there adrift, all by themselves, being kept company just by New Zealand the Pacific Islands. I am aware that they are on the opposite side of the equator from where I am, and so when its summer here, its winter there. That, cowboy boots, kangaroos, and an unfortunate record for treating indigenous people fairly, one which the US shares, about sum up my knowledge base.Im embarrassed to admit that I didnt know the capital was Canberra.Nixon was mostly not focused on Australia, and that, it seems, was a part of the problem. Menzies had preceded Whitlam as prime minister, and he too was an old hand who thought largely in Cold War terms. Nixon and Menzies had been fond of one another. But when elections were held and the beleaguered President Lyndon Johnson was due to leave Washington, he told Australias representatives, who were opposed to the US intervention in Vietnam, that they might have one or two problems with Mr. Nixon. It was a very droll understatement.First, Nixon was outraged that a nation that looked to the US for security and aid would dare publicly criticize its role in Vietnam, and thenworsein Cambodia. He regarded the Australians as a satellite that ought to be grateful and not bite the hand, etc.Gough Whitlam took office with an eye toward creating a more independent Australia. He considered Australia very unlikely to be in danger of external attack for ten or fifteen years at least, and was aghast at Uncle Sams ugly doings in Indochina. He was looking for distance, and Nixon, under enough pressure from enemies without getting it from friends, erupted. Eventually Richard Nixon played a dangerous bluff on Moscow by recalling nuclear missiles from nearby Fiji, which involved the use of Australian terrain, without actually notifying the Australians. Visions of a mushroom cloud on home soil didnt do much to endear President Nixon or the American government to Australians, needless to say.Whereas Nixon was convinced that communist hoards would continue to advance across Asia unless Vietnam was forced to adopt a parliamentary democracy, Australia felt that it was time for the super powers to quit telling smaller nations what to do and abide by home rule in whatever form its citizens chose.Though no actual shooting war was ever threatened or contemplated, the US did examine alternate places for its basesa $5 billion dollar investment in 1970s dollarsand at one point, Australian dock workers voted not to unload goods from US ships. In turn, US dock workers placed a moratorium on Australian trade, which left a good deal of beef rotting near the dock for days on end. And sometimes, with breathtaking rapidity, trade wars can in fact lead to shooting wars. It wasnt going to happen this time, though; the USA already had its plate full.It probably is telling of my own ethnocentrism that I had difficulty focusing on the lengthy passages leading up to the conflict. Theres a fair amount of detail regarding Australian politics that novices like me may find it hard to plow through. On the other hand, the author should have known that communists would never use the term Vietcong, which was a pejorative. Vietnamese freedom fighters are referred to as members of the National Liberation Force.Even if the reader gives in and skims those bits of political nuance that will suit some interest levels but not others, there is a great deal of entertaining dialogue and detail in the meaty center of this work to make it worth reading.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 23, 2015,B00XBHP9R8,Unholy Fury: Whitlam and Nixon at War,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XBHP9R8,Melbourne University Publishing,$8.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Best for Niche Audience; Social Justice, Child Psychology,I confess I was intrigued by the title and description of this biography. Mr. Rogers came on television when I was entering adolescence, and so I didnt watch it for myself. When I had children of my own, I tried to limit their time spent in front of TV, and so I tended to watch Sesame Street with them and then reach for the off button. But my son wanted to see Mr. Rogers, and I confess that although the magic escaped mewho wanted to watch this dull man with the puppet on his hand, seriously?my son, who was three years old, thought differently. I watched the little smile play on his lips as Mister Rogers spoke to him, face straight into the camera. It made my kid feel better. And so I decided to plunge into this biography and see if I could figure out what made the show so appealing to little kids. I went all the way through a Masters degree in education and came out still clueless, so why not? Thank you to Net Galley and Westminster John Knox Press for the DRC. The title was published in March and is available for purchase.On the whole, I never did find the magic, but from an analytical standpoint, I could see where the work done by Fred Rogers was effective. He treated small people with respect. He was an expert in the psychology of very young children, and his show was crafted around gently, reassuringly addressing some issues that parents might not know how to talk to their children about. This is not to say that he had a superior attitude or spoke down to parents, when he acknowledged our presence, but I was a mom who had spent my entire pregnancy unemployed, sitting around the house reading books about pregnancy, childbirth, and the raising of young children, and I had no idea that my son had been afraid he might go down the drain after the bath was over. And I watched his little face light up when Mr. Rogers sat at the piano and sang, You can never go down, never go down, never go down the drain!The first twenty percent or so of this biography deals with Rogers religious beliefs, and I nearly had to stick myself with a pin to stay awake through it. The guy was a pacifist, and so although he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister, his belief system and his quiet, subdued manner was largely that of the Friends, or Quakers. So for those who have a strong interest in examining the intricate details of faith as it relates to war and children, this will be more absorbing than it was for me.Just at about the point at which I had decided that grabbing the galley had been a mistakeseriously, 176 pages and I had only read twenty percent? It felt like foreverand gave myself permission to skim and review this thing, it became more interesting. And although I think the author very much overstates his case in calling Rogers subversive, I agree that he openly, if subtly and carefully, disagreed with Presidents Reagan and HW Bush about the wars in the Middle East, and before that, with the Vietnam War. He never carried a sign, our writer points out several times, but chose to work behind the scenes and to use his television show as a platform for peace.War isnt nice.He was no radical; during the Civil Rights movement, rather than encourage integration, he held fundraisers to buy supplies for the African-American schools that were separate and entirely unequal, to try to level things out a little bit, one school district at a time. Good luck with that.But the real gift that he gave to small children was that of absolute acceptance. Children were valuable no matter what they looked like. He acknowledged that we feel mad sometimes, and talked about ways to work out the mad without hurting anyone. He recognized that sometimes girls want to play with machines, and sometimes boys might like to hold a doll, to dress it and pretend to feed it. His was a gentle persona, and he let everyone know that men can also be nurturers. And when a company presumed to use his likeness on a tee shirt with a gun in his hand, he took their ass to court and made them not only stop selling those shirts, but destroy every last one they still had in their possession or for sale.He also had blind spots. He was raised in a wealthy familyMr. McFeely, the neighborhood postal character in the Make Believe neighborhood where Mr. Rogers filmed, was also the name of his grandfather, who built the family fortune. And at Christmas time, the staff of Mr. Rogerss TV show each got a nice card with a note saying he had made a gift in their name to a charity; but one of the staffers pointed out to the author that some of them were paid very low salaries, and sure could have used the holiday bonus instead.A documentary that was filmed about Fred Rogers was made with the understanding that the cameras must not show the tasteful opulence of my home.Ahem.The writer does a fine job of analyzing where Fred Rogers stood on all of the key issues of the day before his rather sudden death due to stomach cancer. If this man was important to you, or if you have an interest in the connection between social justice and religion, or childrens television shows, this might be a great book for you. If you are not interested in religion, you may want to skim through the first chapters and get to the meatier parts.Either way, Fred wouldve liked you exactly as you are now.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 17, 2015,0664260470,Peaceful Neighbor: Discovering the Countercultural Mister Rogers,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0664260470,Westminster John Knox Press,$16.19
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Best for LG G3,First, I should say that I haven't really challenged this case. Those old enough will remember the crazy advertising in which wrist watches were taken deep sea diving, luggage manhandled by a gorilla, and both came out good as new. So, I haven't dropped my phone off a tall building, or even on cement. I've dropped it on the floor from the counter, and onto the back yard deck, and it's bounced off the surface the way it is supposed to.If you look at all the photos for this product, you'll see a black plate that looks like a bank vault door. Nobody uses that part of the case, at least that I have seen. If I were going on a plane and had to put my phone in a bin where it might get knocked onto the floor, maybe I would, but for general use, that thing is in the way of using the phone. But it's okay, because you don't need it. The real safety feature is that rubber rim, which surrounds your LG G3 phone and is thicker than the phone, so that in most cases, if you drop your cell phone the rim will catch the impact and shield the glass face. If you went rock climbing and took your phone, you'd want that plate over the front (if you really have to climb with your phone) because rocks are an irregular surface, and a falling phone might connect its face with a jutting rock. But for those of us with fairly sedentary urban lives, for those running for buses, working indoors or doing casual outdoor work, it will do the job.Perhaps more to the point? There isn't anything better. Yes, it costs more, but there's not really any point in buying a case at all if it won't protect your phone.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 5, 2015,B00KTLIZ7K,OtterBox Defender Series Case for LG G3 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Blue Chill (Deep Water Blue/Whisper White),Cell Phones & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KTLIZ7K,none,none
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Best Buy,The neighborhood yard sale was approaching, and our home is set back a bit further on the street than the houses on either side, so I was afraid passing cars would miss our sale. I broke my environmentally-conscious ban on balloons because I didn't want to go out and buy mylar balloons for a yard sale. I bought a package of these balloons in yellow, and a second package in twilight blue.Both packages of balloons inflated 100% to 12 inches. Packages used to have more balloons in them back in the day, but you also had to expect a few duds. No duds in this batch. We blew up all 20 balloons and tied them to strings in little bunches, then went to bed. The next morning at crazy-early o'clock, I got up to tie the balloons to various prominent surfaces out front before heading out there with our stuff. All 20 balloons are still fully inflated after sitting all night long. Not bad!By 9 AM, the sale has begun; people line the sidewalks, and the balloons have served their purpose. We no longer have to worry about being seen, because there are goods out front and people buying them. But at about 1 PM, a curious thing happened. The blue balloons began to pop! One, then a couple minutes later, two more, and by 3 PM only one blue balloon remained intact, whereas all of the yellow balloons were still inflated.The day was hot for Seattle--upper 80's--so maybe the darker colored balloons drew the heat and therefore popped sooner? Hey, who knows. I doubt any of you really need balloons that will last for more than 15 hours once inflated, which all of these did.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,2,Not Tall Enough in Toe Box No Matter What Size,A good leather shoe is only good if the manufacturer is willing to use enough leather for the average person to fit their foot inside. Look at the height of this toe box. We should not have even tried it, but since leather stretches, we went ahead and ordered a pair. It does not matter what size shoe you order if there is too little leather for a human foot height-wise. We tried ordering it a half size up, but it made no difference. It is just a badly designed shoe. We sent it back. Amazon was great about getting us a refund right away, and we ordered some other shoes from amazon that turned out great.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,December 31, 2014,B00BI1U5TQ,Trotters Women's Zane Flat,Black,6.5 M US,Shoes,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI1U5TQ,Trotters Footwear,$38.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Do It!,Hey, these are really nice quality. I bought them because an international student was coming to live with us, and (perhaps because of the bedbug epidemic? Who knows?) the homestay company requested that we have all new linens for the student. I ordered these and a second set; the second set is from a different company and ordered off a different website, a little cheaper than these but not much. These are much, much nicer. They are heavy, tightly woven, very absorbent, and they wash up as if they were brand new. We've only had them for a couple months, but so far I have not needed stain remover or even bleach. (We live in the Pacific Northwest, where the water is soft and does not have a lot of rust or clay in it.)The largest towels (two) are about like what you'd get in a very nice hotel. They are not big bath sheets that you can wrap all the way around you, but they are larger and heftier than average.I would buy these again in a heartbeat!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 1, 2015,B005TOX7F2,Superior 900 Gram Egyptian Cotton 6-Piece Towel Set, White,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TOX7F2,Superior,$53.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,1,One Passage Ruins the Whole Thing,Whoa now! The times, they have a-changed, and isnt that a great thing? Thus this once-socially-acceptable novel, a spy thriller steeped in the Cold War politics of the mid-20th century, no longer works. But thank you for the invitation to review, friends at Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media; I know you meant well.The author presents a situation in which escaped Nazis are developing plans to foment a second fascist government, developed abroad till the time is right. The ones we visit are sequestered in Egypt. At the same time, Israels equivalent of the CIA is out hunting for escaped Nazis, who will die quietly and unofficially so as to avoid international incidents. The writer knows his craft well, and shows considerable skill in building suspense by jumping us from one group to the other at critical, cliff-hanging moments.One single sentence caused me to climb off Craigs bus, so to speak:It was the brandy that triggered them to drag the girl off the streets and rape her for two days.Had this been the perspective of a deranged psychopath, a mindset clearly different from that of the good guys, I would have been more generous with my rating and review, but this guy is supposed to be the marshmallow among his set, the old softy who gets himself into trouble by trying to save the suffering damsels.Give me a break.For this novel: no, no, and one more time: no!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 29, 2015,B013S432TA,The Strasbourg Legacy,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013S432TA,Open Road Media Mystery & Thriller,$7.99

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Compact Machine Fits Kitchen Shelf, Sounds Great,It was early December. We had finished rocking around the Christmas tree, and had moved on to baking. And then our old DVD player, which we kept in the kitchen since my daughter and I do a lot of cooking and baking, died. What? Couldn't make Christmas cookies without music!I was actually sort of surprised to find a machine that would also play cassettes, of which we still own a few, but mostly I just wanted a simple inexpensive CD player that would fit on top of the shelf neatly (which it does, even with the antenna) and play music without a lot of fuss or trouble. The buttons are easy to understand without consulting a manual. To open the CD compartment, one pushes gently on the front right corner. It opens on its own, so even somewhat floury fingers can reach in, nab the old CD out of it and plant another one in without a thorough hand-washing. Perfect! The sound is not as sophisticated as an expensive machine with speakers all over the room, but it is a better sound than the one we had before it, and we are quite happy.I have not used the radio feature except once accidentally, so all I can say about that part is that my radio seems to work.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,January 10, 2015,B00INEG8W4,Sony CFDS50 Portable CD, Cassette & AM/FM Radio Boombox,MP3 Players & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00INEG8W4,Sony,$49.97
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,New Female Sleuth Kicks It; Feed Your Reader!,Theres a murderer on the loose, one that has killed across international boundaries. The weapon of choice? An ice pick. Happily, the case is assigned to total bad-ass Commander Jana Matinova, the best new female detective Ive seen in emerge in crime fiction in decades. Thank you to Net Galley and Brash Books for the DRC. This title will be available for purchase November 3.Part of what initially attracted me to this novel was the setting. Though Matinova finds herself crossing into various parts of central Europe, she is based in Slovakia, a country not even on my personal radar. By way of apology, I will point out that for most of my life, a giant swath of Europe and Asia was designated as USSR, and the satellite states lined up like faithful guardians around its perimeter included Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, both of which have been carved into different nations since the Stalinist realm crumbled. So I thought Id learn a little bit about the contemporary contours of central Europe in the most enjoyable way possiblethrough fiction.Genelin doesnt disappoint. Along with Matinova, we have a collection of other cops, some of whom garnered truly fetching descriptions, such as this one: With his thinning hair and lopsided smile he looked like a harmless, slightly unkempt beagle without its long ears.In addition we have the sinister Koba, a master criminal that Matinova considers akin, perhaps, to Holmess Moriarty. Kobas role in Genelins story is complex and fascinating.But most of all, I appreciated the development of Jana Matinova, both for her silver-bullet speed and cleverness, and also for that which is not included. We never hear about her hair, makeup, or her figure; we dont need to know anything about her love life, and if she experiences any ambivalence about her lack of a domestic life, we dont hear about it. In fact, Genelin treats his protagonist just as he would a male protagonist.Now isnt that a breath of fresh air?The fifth star, which I would have loved to be able to add to this engaging story, is denied because of problematic passages that popped up often enough to warrant ten different notations in my kindle: Too wordy! Tighten it up! It seemed either as if there were two writers, one more capable than the other, co-writing the novel, or as if someone whose mother tongue is not English was struggling to say what needed saying. I noticed this was most frequent during passages of narrative, and less likely to occur during dialogue. Whatever it is, it could benefit greatly from either some rewritten passages or strong editing. But every time I found my eyes jerking through one of these verbose areas in the text, sooner or later we would come out slick as a whistle, and everything would commence to flow again. I dont think a published text has ever confused me so much in this regard.That being said, I would cheerfully read other books in this series given the opportunity. Because when push comes to shove, Commander Jana Matinova is a champ!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 3, 2015,B013XBIVTE,For the Dignified Dead,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013XBIVTE,Brash Books,$4.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,1,No, no, no.....NO.,This is what I got for trying to protect my phone without spending real money. I bought this package of 3 screen protectors, and first of all, even carefully following the instructions, it is just about impossible to put it on right. The screen is supposed to fit over the top of my LG G3 exactly, but it is actually a little too large, and so while using it (I was determined to use it; I paid for it after all), part of the screen doesn't respond well to touch, because there is space between this cover and the actual face of the phone. It draws lint like crazy on both the underneath part where it isn't adhered to the screen, as well as the top where you're trying to use it. And the final joy is that there is a little opaque, colored tab--presumably where one handles the protector--that does not come off once the screen cover is on the phone. It is extremely distracting, poking up just above the phone and in your peripheral vision, but if you finally insist (as I finally did) on removing that tag with your fingernails, guess what is left? A corner of nasty, gluey crap. Seriously.I was so determined not to waste something I paid for that I tried to put a second one on once that one bit the dust, gluey crap and all, two weeks after I forced it onto my phone. Utter fail.The only plus is the teeny little rag they give you to wipe the surface clean; it's the type you would use for eye glasses, except waaaaay smaller.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Taut Pacing and Packed Heat Make This a Must-Read!,These fellows in their cammies offering their guns for hire would know about things like T-ambushes, wind drift and long-range rifle fire, and maybe a boobie trap or two. I knew about close-in fire, street work and fear.Originally published under the title Monterey, this is the sixth installment in the Peter Bragg series, and the pace is as taut as piano wire. Dont count on falling asleep just after you finish it; allow time for your heart to stop pounding and your blood pressure to ease up a bit. Its an outstanding thriller that left me breathless.Its a shame the writer is no longer living and cant write a bazillion more novels for us to enjoy; he could wiggle a finger and I would follow him anywhere. His series does not have to be read in order; this one is great as a stand-alone novel. And by now I am also supposed to have told you that thanks to Net Galley and the lovely fellows at Brash Books, I read this free as a DRC. Had it cost me actual dollars, it would have been well worth it.Bragg is back in California where he belongs, and hes spending some time with girlfriend Allison Stone. Whilst on vacation, however, an old friend of Braggs is widowed, and is a suspect in her husbands murder. Shes not a very nice person; in fact, shes a pain in the ass. But Bragg is convinced of her innocence, and she has even gone to her relatives, hat in hand, in order to come up with his fee. Hes in it now, and Bragg always plays to win.Though its set in the 1980s, the lack of technology (no satellites; when you are stuck out there alone, you are seriously alone!) and Braggs hard-boiled demeanor give this series a strong noir flavor. I appreciate a detective that knows he needs to have his gun handy. This is the USA, for heavens sake! Bad guys always pack heat. We retired school teachers can stay inside, lock the door, and let the dog guard our homes, but Bragg is chasing bad guys, and he goes in prepared. Its a good thing he does.When things start to heat up, he tells Allison that the situation has become dangerous, and she should hop a plane to San Francisco. Hell take her to the airport himself. And she says shes not doing that anymore; she needs to know what its like to live with his vocation. Theyre getting serious; he wants her to marry him. Lets find out right now what this whole thing is like.Turns out, thats a terrible idea.Bragg is such a strong protagonist, and the way Lynch bounces his street-smart persona off the smug, wealthy folk that live in Carmel, Bel Sur, and other hoity-toity beauty spots is masterful. The climax made me want to stand up and cheer. What a total bad ass! Way to go.The best news of all is that this little hummer was released digitally in February, so you can have it right now.Dont leave home without it!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,April 3, 2015,B00KAJXBCK,Truth or Die: A Bragg Thriller,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAJXBCK,Brash Books,$2.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Good Stop-Gap Measure,For the price, this is a good trellis. I wanted it so that our Japanese wisteria would have something to climb. Originally I had a string threaded across the top of the fence, and then when it got to the property line, the next door neighbor had crafted a sturdy wood trellis about 7 feet tall for it to grow up. It's an expensive plant, and so this was a win for both of us. That is, until my son, who was helping in the yard, inadvertently dug up the tap root while going after some deep, stubborn weeds. So we figured that was it, and for 2 years, there was no more wisteria. Sad, sad.This year the plant came back, surprising me by snaking its way up in the middle of a hydrangea bush. I didn't want to risk killing either one with a transplant, and since the tendrils were reaching for something to grab, I bought this trellis and my spouse fixed it to the top fence post, about 4 feet off the ground and between the bush and the neighbor's trellis This trellis reaches up to about the 6 foot mark and is in the middle area between the hydrangea bush and the next door neighbor's trellis, which it has reached after absorbing the space on this trellis.This is not an extremely sturdy trellis, and it isn't tall enough to put into the ground and expect very much of anything to climb up it. But the product description does give the height. I am not sure it is strong enough to stand independently, so if you buy it, do so with the understanding that you will have to affix it to another object such as a fence, or else reinforce it in some way.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 22, 2015,B001H1JKMA,Panacea Products 36-Inch Fan Pot Trellis, Green,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H1JKMA,Panacea Products,$13.54
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Smart and Sassy; Highly Recommended!,Storme Front, the second mystery in the series featuring former NFL player Wyatt Storme and his buddy, Chick Easton, is smart and sassy. Ripley proves that an action-packed thriller with a he-man protagonist is stronger, not weaker when it treats women respectfully, as equals to men. Thank you twice, first to Net Galley, and second to Brash Books. I received this DRC from them in exchange for an honest review. This title was released August 4, so you can get it right away.When someone offers one a thousand dollars to make a single, simple delivery, its natural to be suspicious. But when it appears to also involve pulling a good friends cojones out of the fire, an experienced badass will sometimes agree, however cautiously, to tag along. So it is here. Drugs, guns, and bodies pile up, and all through it runs some kick-ass banter that made me laugh out loud a number of times. The exchanges are typically between Wyatt and Chick, but theres some pretty strong humor, at times, in the interactions between Wyatt and his fianc&eacute;e, Sandra Collingsworth, as well. As well as respect. I like the respect even better.No one likes smart, self-assured women, you know.Except you, she said. And Im glad.Complicating the picture without making it into a soap opera is the involvement, however peripherally, of an old flame of Wyatts. They split up a long time ago, and she married the man whose afore-mentioned cojones Wyatt is trying to salvage.His wife? said Billy, smiling. Aint she a sweet piece ofHer names Kelly, I said, interrupting. But you can call her Mrs. Jenkins.The action is linear in format, so the fairly sizeable number of characters dont create confusion. Then too, Ripleys memorable character sketches certainly help:Snakeskins came around the truck. He had a big face, crooked nose. About thirty. A little overweight. Too many Coors in cowboy bars. Blond mustache, untrimmed, and a diamond stud in one ear. His hands were immense.Oh, there are so many more memorable passages, and I highlighted 78 of them, just for giggles. But the fact is, I would just hate to ruin it all for you. All told, the flavor is a bit like Sue Graftons, but with male protagonists in Colorado.The examples Ive provided show up early on, but the pace never slows till the last page is turned.In the end, I just wanted to read the next book in the series. And so will you.Highly recommended for mystery and thriller lovers, or for anyone that needs a snappy, amusing beach read.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 24, 2015,1941298818,Storme Front: A Wyatt Storme Thriller (The Wyatt Storme Thriller Series),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1941298818,Brash Books,$13.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Taut Psychological Thriller,Many times my daughter has come upon me reading a book and asked, How is it? And almost every time I have said, I dont know. I havent read the end yet. This is completely true for this one. And oh my my my, what an ending. No, stop worrying, I have no intention of giving away anything.But I will thank Net Galley and Atria Books. I appreciate the opportunity to read a free DRC in exchange for this honest review.Above all you dont want to forget. If you forget this, you might be forgetting other things, too. Thats a slippery slope that nobody wants to slide down.Jerry is just 49 years old, and he has Alzheimers. After the diagnosis, he starts a journal, partially with the idea of recording all the things he doesnt want to forget so that he can come back and find them later. But fate has other ideas for our protagonist, and for his nom de plume, Henry Cuttera cute play on the actual authors name or is it his pen name?As we find ourselves gradually creeping down that long dark tunnel with poor Jerry, the journal becomes more and more confused. Is he a killer? If so, how many people has he killed? Why cant he remember doing any of it?But then, he cant remember much of anything these days Trust No One is a brilliantly paced, tautly written piece of psychological fiction, and it is proof that, contrary to the old saying, not all stories have already been written. And the title answers his question, a very good question: who can he trust?The problem here is that someone in Jerrys position has to be able to trust someone. And as the plot moves further along, the reader cant help wondering whether all of the characters in the story actually exist.Those searching for an absorbing vacation reador even one to curl up with at home, hunkered under the air conditioner or fan on a dog-hot daycant really ask for anything better than this. Cleave gives the reader every possible frisson in this impossibly complex, yet strangely accessible novel.Highly recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 10, 2015,1476779171,Trust No One: A Thriller,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476779171,Atria Books,$16.36
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Pythonesque Tale of Zombie Cow Apocalypse Perfect for Summer Vacation,Where theres war, theres udder destruction. Michael Logans new release, World War Moo, is the sequel to Apocalypse Cow. Mix the zombie apocalypse with mad cow disease, toss in some technology, then ask the spirits of Terry Pratchett and Monty Python to hop into the cauldron. What follows is a deeply mooooving story that is bound to amuse. Many thanks go to Net Galley and St. Martins Press for allowing me a glimpse in advance.How does one contain the deadly infection that has taken over the British Isles, and why are some people inexplicably immune to it? The world appears to have gone stark raving mad, or at least, part of it has. Trade among nations has been obliterated, and famine is rampant. Inflation is out of control, and when you find yourself spending a thousand pounds for a rat kebab, its pretty clear that simply surviving ought to be the order of the day.Not so for young Geldof. His Grandfather Carstairs, the evil genius who twiddles his moustache to prove his inner nature, has appeared and told him that his mother is alive and in danger. Fanny must be rescued from Britain before the bombs fall; theres even talk of dropping neutron bombs. Grandfather Carstairs has come to help Geldof, not because of any depth of affection, but because he needs an heir to take over his evil empire. He has to find out whether Geldof is man enough to do the job.In addition to being entertained, I greatly appreciated Logans metaphorical explanation of the difference between male and female brains. In fact, much of the book is composed of hilarious metaphors and similes. English teachers paradise meets the zombie cow apocalypse: the stuff of which dreams are made.This absurd story, second in its series, was released yesterday.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Really Well Made Shoes, Comfy and Attractive,I was planning to order my teenager some new shoes for Christmas, but her old comfy loafers were so worn out from chasing city buses that the sole was flapping. I gave them to her early. She's been wearing them nearly every day for over a month and absolutely loves them. She is on her feet a great deal, takes two buses to get to school and two more to get home in the Seattle rain. Apart from being muddy (ha), they still look great. The leather has stretched very slightly to conform to the shape of her feet, but they still look good. The black color and the fact that it's actual leather and not synthetic means that when they start to get scuffed, she will be able to go over them with a damp cloth, then use shoe polish and keep them looking good a long time. The gradual heel height keeps them from killing her feet, but it adds a little height, which of course makes a person look a little bit thinner. All told, it's a well made shoe, both comfortable and flattering. I expect these to last her years, even though she will wear them often.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Funnier Than Hell,Off and Running is a comic caper set around Y2K. Jack is a writer looking for his lucky break; Walt is an old man, a beloved American icon who hasnt published a memoir yet. Garrett is Walts ill-begotten, bad-tempered adult son, the worst celebrity brat imaginable. Reed tosses them all into his literary blender and what comes out is both hilarious and at times, genuinely suspenseful as well. Thank you once more to Brash Books and Net Galley for permitting me a sneak peek; this amusing tale will be for sale in August.Jack has had one project after another not work out. His wife, Sarah, has had it with him, and wants him to go out and get a real job. Every day she schleps out to her full time job, coming home tired and ill tempered, and she doesnt want to hear anymore about how Jacks latest book proposal will make money for sure. She has a change of heart when Jacks agent sends him out to see the venerated, universally loved comedian, Walt Stuckey. Walt is choosey about who he sees and what he talks about, but over time, Jack builds a genuine rapport with him. They become friends, and Jack is accepted as Walts biographer. Just as Walt invites Jack and Sarah to come stay the weekend with him and his girlfriend, Mary, the unthinkable happens: Walt has a stroke. The son-from-hell Walt loves but has been unable to develop a positive relationship with takes charge. Walt is held virtually a prisoner, and it soon becomes clear that Garrett does not really want Walt to recover. He wants Walts financial empire, and he will be the executor of Walts estate when he goes.So the first thing Garrett does is to isolate Walt. Since his own memoir is the one thing Walt is truly excited about and could give him reason to live, Garrett uses his power-of-attorney privilege to fire Jack and cancel the memoir. Mary isnt having any of it, and once he thinks about it, neither is Jack. Jack is determined to finish this book. Its what Walt wants, too. And most of all, Jack wants to know why the reference to Bebe Rebozo in Walts comedy routine caused his over the top hit comedy show, which was funnier n hell, to be cancelled without a moments warning. Hell find out, or die trying.So Jack and Mary launch a rescue mission to free Walt from his rotten son-turned-captor, and the result is alternately suspenseful and hilarious.There are several events in the book that strain credulity, but its okay, because this is not literary fiction; this is a caper. I couldnt wait to see how it ended, and I was sorry when it did. A considerable portion of the story is set in Death Valley, and the heat, the inescapable sun, the gritty sand were all so palpable that I nearly resolved never to leave my cool damp domicile again.We all need something ridiculous in our lives now and then. Humor relaxes us and puts our own worries into perspective. Do yourself a favor and order this book.

I bought it after reading the reviews, and so it has a particular purpose. For most of my yard, I use drip hoses, but I have a few plants that are in pots on my front porch and in the flower beds around the porch, and they don't get the drip hose. These I would ordinarily water by filling up a watering can and dousing them one by one.My front porch is covered, and does not get a lot of direct sun, though temperatures here have been past 90, unusually intense for Seattle.I had read that this thing would leak like a sieve if it was exposed to any rose bushes or other prickly plants (pine bushes near my flowers, for example) so I am quite careful not to yank it across those types of plants.Because I got it really cheap, and because I have a particular purpose, I am happy with my purchase. It is much lighter weight than a rubber hose. I know everyone says to drain it every time, and I do, but I swear not more than a few drops come out. But then, I also don't turn the faucet on as far as it will go, only about halfway.When not in use, it is not on a rack, because other reviewers advised against it. I have a crate on my porch and it lays coiled there happily until I go back for it the next day. The one I got is royal blue, and it's kind of pretty.Under these circumstances, I would do it again. I would not pony up big bucks for it, though.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 18, 2015,B00UK2ZUVC,none,none,none,none,none
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Escapist Fun That Respects Diverse Races, Genders,This one is 4.75 stars, rounded up. Thank you to Net Galley and to Thomas and Mercer for the DRC. This absorbing thriller is now available for purchase.Cassie Ireland is an asset recovery specialist; she views herself as a modern-day Robin Hood whose job it is to steal back money, goods, or even really embarrassing videos from those that originally stole them. Her employer is a shadowy individual code-named Prometheusa moniker chosen because Prometheus was the sneak thief of the gods. Irelands nimble, silent in her work, and careful in trusting others. She really cant be played.Her job here is to steal select items from the home safe of crooked-wealthy magnate Alan Kendrick. In order to gain access to his treasure trove, she must first make it past a sophisticated security system, to which she gains access by deceiving Kendricks wife, Gina. Once Cassie found her way into that safe, I stopped breathing until she was out again. I think my fingertips turned blue. But once shes been in and out, things once more begin to unspool at a heart-pounding pace.Jake Carter is a professional gambler, and he too has a grudge to settle with Alan Kendrick. He plans to beat him at poker; hes fast, smart, and fair. Unfortunately, the last whale he took down has sent goons after him. They want the money he took from Theo at the table, and they also want him dead. Jakes challenge is to go after Kendrick while dodging Theos assassins.Ultimately, Cassie, Jake, Theo and Kendrick all land on the same enormous floating gambling casino. You can run but only so far. You can hide, but sooner or later, youll be found. On the other hand, you can also turn your stalkers into your prey, if youre cunning and well organized, and if you can gain the loyalty of others nearby. And then too, you might be able to grab a helicopter!All In is fast, escapist fun. Ordinarily I would call this a four-star review. Four stars are my default for books that are anywhere from pretty good to really good, but that dont meet the gold standard of five stars. My four star reviews are big houses with a lot of rooms. If I hate a book but concede that others are likely to enjoy it, I will go with four stars and explain what I didnt like. I also give four star reviews to books like this one that I like a lot, but cant see them as the very epitome of their genre. Five stars means excellence that is above and beyond ordinary work.The tipping point here that knocked this up to five stars is the use of race and gender. Nobody wants to be preached at in the middle of a thriller, and Goldman and Klink dont do that. Rather, it is by the assumptions that are inherent in their choice of protagonist (Ireland is African-American, female, smart as hell and way more fit than any gum shoe I can recall); the way the plot unfolds, with no helpless damsels waiting for great big men to come save them; and the way secondary characters are handled, the butler foremost among them. It reminded me a bit of Barbara Neelys writing, and so I wanted to stand up and cheer.Fall is coming, and whether you are still basking in the sun on weekends or huddled by a fire, its a great time to treat yourself to a tightly paced, accessible thriller by authors that show their respect for all people, especially the working class, in the way they sculpt their characters and plot. It looks like a winner to me.Why not order it while you can?,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 12, 2015,B00V7BLU3W,All In,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7BLU3W,Thomas & Mercer,$4.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Brainy Novel Provides Forum for Key Social Issues,Blanche Cleans Up, which is #3 in the Blanche White mystery series, is more than a murder mystery, as the numerous word plays in the title imply. This is a smart, funny-yet-serious series, and I am thrilled to be able to review another one for Net Galley and Brash Books, who provided me with a DRC. This title was released at the beginning of May, and so you ought to be able to buy it right now.Blanche is a single African-American woman who chooses to do domestic work so that she can select her employers. She is good at her work, and so anybody she doesnt like, doesnt get to hire her. But in this episode, she has been roped into a job she otherwise would not do, at the behest of a family member. Inez, their usual cook and head housekeeper, is in desperate need of a vacation, and Inez cant go unless she can guarantee a good substitute to take her place. Blanche, who sometimes has an acid tongue but also a heart of purest marshmallow, caves in and agrees to step in for a week. Of course, after all hell breaks loose, Inez is gone for at least two weeks. Who wouldnt be, under the circumstances?Neely is a seriously brainy writer. Meta-meta-meta-cognition is all over the place in Blanches internal narratives. Its an approachable way to talk about social issues, primarily race, but also about sexism, the rights of gay and lesbian people, and of course, about class. So if you are socially conservative if you are conservative, why are you reading my review at all? What are you thinking? Are you new here? Get out get out get out. Shoo! Scoot. Skedaddle.Ah. I feel better now. Gave me quite a turn. Anyway, those who are looking for a mystery because their brain is tired and they just want a cozy readand I do this myself from time to time, nothing wrong with itwill need a different book, because Blanche books are really about social issues, and the mystery is merely an approachable forum with which to address them. Not that pacing, characterization, and story arc are missing; far from it! I was riveted from the seventy percent mark and had to finish it. Its a solid story, not literary fiction, but a good mystery. But if you are looking for a good story and think you will just ignore the issues under discussion, you are mistaken, because they are so strongly interwoven here that its impossible to just read it for the mystery aspect.I should also mention that the intended audience appears to be Black folk and other people of color. That doesnt mean Caucasians cant enjoy it, and it may be a good lesson in empathy, especially if you havent done a lot of introspection. At times, Neely echoes WEB DuBois on the color line; in the elite white folks household, a young Black man who was close to the child in residence was welcome through the front door until.Neely weaves a lot of plot points and a lot of issues into one deft tale. Its really well crafted. I especially enjoyed the development of Blanches adopted son (nephew whose mother is dead) along with neighborhood activist Aminata. And I liked what she did with her teenage relative who developed a serious problem.When you finish the book, you almost have to have a heart and mind that is a little more open to types of people you might have unthinkingly dismissed before. Theres really nothing else like it. How often do you get the opportunity to improve yourself and have fun at the same time?

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Side-Splitting Detective Fiction; You Better Get You a Copy!,Its tourist season in Memphis; the Mississippi Delta land is filling up with convention-goers and barbecue lovers. Theyre fixing to parachute in a couple of whole hog carcasses, but not until after the Cotton Queen goes by on her float. And this being Delta country, the float really is a float; it is a barge made over, and she is much more concerned about keeping every hair exactly where it belongs than she is about finding out who killed Daddy the other night. Okay, actually she pretty much knows, and it was badly done. But damned if its going to spoil her special day. As for me, I just want to say thank you to Net Galley and Brash Books for the DRC. Its been a dark but enjoyable viewing.So lets have a chat, just the two of us, about the best way to break into an ATM machine. Never tried it myself. I would never have thought to do it the Memphis way, so maybe its just as well I turned out to be more the sort to read and write things and less the criminal type. Because frankly, I never would have considered just ripping the thing off its moorings with a forklift and driving it away to where I could tear it apart in privacy. Franklin Saxon is more suited to this kind of activity. Well let him do it, or at least direct the hired help to do it. Well, for as long as he can, anyway; things dont go well for him up the road a fair piece.As for our local cops, JW Ragsdale just wants to get out of Memphis for a bit. Its so humid, so crowded. The bugs alone will make you crazy. If he can launch an investigation that will take him out of town, preferably with a fishing pole and a six-pack in tow, hell be happy to fill out the paperwork saying hes been on the job, been conducting critical interviews.How sad for him, then, that he is so good at his work. One interview leads to another, and before you know it, the man is right in the thick of all sorts of drug smuggling, fraud, thievery and yes, oh yes murder. It aint so much a holiday after all, and looky here, even the barbecue done turned rancid. It really isnt his day.The Bones family figures prominently; theyre employees of Franklin Saxon, recently bereaved son of Aires Saxon. The hard part is not sampling the merchandise. Shee-it, said Stone Job. Shee-it. Merchandise. Why you call it that? Fool, thats what it is. Thats what we be buying and selling. Why you think wedone made a withdrawal from the ATM the other night?To pay the white man the money for the rock. Thats why.Right, you getting it. That be the Bones business Free enterprise, m*****f****r.At first, with my political antennae always on alert regardless of genre, I was concerned about the negative depiction of African-Americans in the story. Were we going to veer toward stereotypes here? And what is up with the use of the word honky, which I hadnt heard since the 1970s?But not to worry. This little tale treats everyone with equal irreverence. In fact, the very best, sickest humor, to my way of thinking, was the scene at the pork processing plant, when JW indulges in a little fantasy of his own regarding the speed-that-line-up foreman.Trust me.If you are squeamish, if you cant deal with sick humor or gruesome interludes, give it a pass, already. It isnt half as gross as most of whats on television, but never mind; the point of dark humor is to enjoy it, and we want you to have a good time here.If, however, you can read other darkly humorous fiction and come away holding your sides laughing, then this little goodie just might be up your alley. .I recommend you read it separately from meal time, though.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,May 6, 2015,B00TR7IHUM,Memphis Ribs,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TR7IHUM,Brash Books,$2.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Perfect!,I was nervous about this purchase. We had never made creme brulee before, and I wasn't sure I was up for it, but my daughter (teen) was game. And I had seen mixed reviews, too, so I wondered whether these could go in the dishwasher and whether they would shatter beneath a broiler.Not to worry. Everything came out great. They can go (for a brief time anyway) under the broiler; they can go in the dishwasher, the microwave, the oven. They are relatively small (note the specs) and some people prefer a shallower, wider ramekin so they can make creme brulee with more surface area carmelized. Hey, that's up to you. We went the traditional route, and could not be more pleased.Although purchased for a specific purpose, these are also handy for putting small servings of snacks--nuts, small candies, whatever--around when you have a party. We will use them for all kinds of things.Highly recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 5, 2015,B00061N0QO,Norpro 6 Piece Porcelain Ramekin Set,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061N0QO,Norpro,$12.12
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Perfect!,One of my kitchen mats, which I have on my hardwood kitchen floors at the work areas (island, stove, and chopping board by the sink) got to be embarrassing to look at. All the print, which had apparently just been stamped onto rubber, was starting to rub off of it, and a corner of the rubber had crumbled. I am not a house-proud person and am not all that fussy, but it was too much even for me!This one has been with me for almost a year now, and it's holding up a lot better. If crud gets on it, I zap it with a dust buster or the electric broom. It's a lot nicer quality and has more texture.My kitchen is mostly blue with little zaps of red here and there, so it also looks nice.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 21, 2015,B00KJJ76PY,I Love My Kitchen & Utensils Non-Slip Kitchen Rug (Non-Skid) Kitchen Mat Rubber Back Rug 18" x 30" CUC5569-12,Kitchen & Dining,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KJJ76PY,Rugnur,$14.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Good Fantasy Novella, Not Really a Mystery,Janet Shore is the book fairy, a librarian gifted with the supernatural ability to send another person into literature in a literal fashion. She sends them in to enjoy a specific episode, guesses at the time it will take for the event to unfold, and then brings them back. This 75 page long story is interesting, but was mislabeled as a mystery, which is the authors principal genre; its really more a fantasy story. I was waiting for the mystery until toward the end, when I realized there really wasnt one, apart perhaps from final moment, and even then, it isnt a mystery to us. And where are my manners? Thank you to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media for allowing me a glimpse in advance. This story is now for sale digitally.All is going well as long as Janets supernatural power is kept under wraps. Just she and a friend know. Then another person finds out and persuades Janet to come out of her book-fairy closet and advertise her services. She could make a mint. Janet is aghast at the vulgar implication, but the acquaintance persists. She neednt keep the funds for her own use, she tells Janet; think of the causes she could help! So many deserving charities could benefit, all while making so many peopleslets face it, womensfantasies into the vacation of a lifetime.But its too much. Tiny Whidbey Island (located off the shore of Washington State) cant sustain this level of traffic. The locals are at first pleased at the amount of custom, then dismayed at the disruption. No one can buy anything without standing in a very long line. Their favorite quiet spots are now very noisy, busy spots.On top of all of that, Janet is about to give out. She is exhausted, and still they clamor for more.The voice with which this story is told is so different from the Thomas Lynley series (which I adore) that at first, I thought I had inadvertently picked up something by one of the other authors of the same name. But then, its set on Whidbey, where the Thomas-Lynley-George lives, and she even slips in a sly reference to Havers when discussing excellent literature. So yes, it is she.Other reviewers thus far have been more enthusiastic about this piece if they are unfamiliar with, or dont like, the Lynley series. For me, it took a long time to really engage. There are no chapters at all; it is just one long story, a little long for a short story, but maybe too short for a novella. I would have liked it organized, and I might also have enjoyed it more had it been told in something other than the third person. Theres too much narrative, too little dialogue.In the end, though, I found it charming. It just took me awhile to climb on board. I was looking for a mysterious disappearance, and in this case, the surprise element, which I eventually saw coming, was a little disappointing. Theres no mystery to unravel, no detective in the mix.In short, for those who enjoy fantasy stories, this is a winner, and it should be billed as fantasy, not mystery.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 18, 2015,B00WRYERZ6,The Mysterious Disappearance of the Reluctant Book Fairy (Bibliomysteries),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WRYERZ6,MysteriousPress.com/Open Road,$1.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Sizzling Social Justice with a Side Order of Mystery,Blanches mind rang with remembered slights and taunts, and echoes of that awful, heartbreaking instant of fear that was a part of every trip into the white worlda fear of being refused or given poor service because she was black, stopped by a cop because she was black.I finished reading Blanche Passes Go on the second anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, who was shot dead by a cop for jaywalking. Bernie Sanders, the candidate who fancies himself the liberal savior for all progressive-minded Americans, spoke here in Seattle that day. The purpose of his talk, apart from campaigning and fundraising, was to celebrate the birthday of Social Security. The speech was disrupted by a pair of African-American women who took exception to his myopia.So I guess you could say that everyone, even those that dont generally enjoy mysteries, ought to be reading this book right about now. In particular, if the reader is still trying to figure out why so many people, particularly people of color, get upset with the clueless slogan All lives matter, this book is here, just for you. Neely approaches issues of race, class, and gender in a way that is clear but not unkind. Its her best work to date, and could not have been published by Brash Books at a more appropriate time. My great thanks go to them and the people at Net Galley for providing me with a DRC, and to Neely for laying it all out so that anybody who has a willing heart can get the picture.In this fourth Blanche White mystery, Blanche has gone home to Farleigh, North Carolina for a vacation, and to try partnering a catering business with her best friend, Ardell. But Farleigh is a small place, and she cant avoid running up against David Palmer, a Caucasian man that raped her. She never reported it, of course; were they really going to haul the well-heeled, powerful white man for a sperm sample, given the long history of Caucasian men raping Black women with impunity? Not likely! So when her long-simmering rage is ignited by the sight of him, she vows to not only get mad, but to get even as well.Blanche White novels always have multiple threads that weave in and out of the plot line, but this is the most complex and impressive yet. Not only does Blanche have to grapple with Farleigh and Palmer, she is back in her home town, and her mama is still here. Like many women, Blanche has hit middle age and menopause with a renewed, powerful yearning to know more about her mama, who never stops talking but never gives away the personal information Blanche is almost begging for, and about her father, about whom virtually nothing has been told her. Blanche decides that once a person has children, their privacy is no longer as sacred as it was before, and a lot of personal information becomes family property. I loved that.Well into the book, Ardell accuses Blanche of sounding exactly like her mother, and Blanche is dumbfounded to realize its true. I threw back my head and laughed out loud. Its the rare woman that doesnt hear her own mother coming out of her mouth sooner or later, and the moment was built so deftly and executed so well that it landed hard on my funny-bone.Other Blanche novels have accentuated the protagonists tightly held independence. Here, she meets a fine man named Thelvin on the Amtrak coming into Farleigh, and at some point, she has to decide just how flexible (or inflexible) she is going to be.Another component is Mumsfield, an acquaintance that has Downs Syndrome and is about to be married to someone who may be after his money. This aspect of the story, like the others, is skillfully crafted. Mumsfield is not completely helpless, and the fact that he has Downs does not make him Blanches friend, as he claims to be. There is still that division of white privilege. Its not that Blanche could not have a white friend, but it would have to be someone with ownership of what that means.Because all of these components are told in the third person omniscient, and because the writer is a complete badass, we are privy to all the intricacies involved here. Add a problem with domestic abuse next door to the Miz Alice where Blanche is staying, and you have an interesting stew indeedy.Highly recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 11, 2015,B00Y3ZHNZI,Blanche Passes Go: A Blanche White Mystery (Blanche White series Book 4),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y3ZHNZI,Brash Books,$4.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Must-Read Memoir of Feminist Leader,Feminist heroes are everywhere, but if I had to name half a dozen women that were at the core of the feminist movement that followed closely on the heels of the Civil Rights movement and the movement to end the US war in Vietnam, Steinems name would be among them. In fact, hers might be the first name out of my mouth. It was she who coined the salutation Ms, and who founded Ms. Magazine. When I saw she had written a memoir, I knew I had to have it, and when Net Galley and Random House gave me the DRC, I was delighted. But this is one of the few books that if Id had to, Id have been willing to pay full jacket price in order to read. Heroes are thin on the ground these days, and we treasure those that still walk among us.My reading records reflect over 300 biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs Ive read, and I didnt even start listing them until about 3 years ago, so who knows how many? The one thing I know to expect, when someone really famous sits down to tell us about her life, is that the ego will be there. It might be veiled, especially if the person is famous for writing as opposed to something else, or it might be big and bold. Once in awhile its been so bald-faced that I came away wishing I hadnt read the book so I could go on liking the author. So for one of the most famous of living feminists, I was braced and ready.And this icons ego isnt there. I dont mean she hides it well; I just dont find it. And it appears as if large amounts of time spent among Native sisters in struggleWilma Mankiller foremost among themtaught her so much about focusing on the circle, rather than a table that has someone at its head, a big-boss type, that she let go of whatever ego she might have been thinking about building. For example, when she works as an organizer, she dreads public speaking, but looks forward to the place at which one part of the auditorium begins to answer the questions from another part, and she knows a circle has formed, one in which she becomes just another person present. I was blown away!Steinem began her career in journalism, and she is one of the finest writers whose work I have read. For a brief time in years gone by, I dismissed her because of her sometimes-attachment to Democratic party candidates, but the sum of her contributions has been so much more that I missed the forest for the trees during that time of my life. Now I want to read everything she ever wrote.Travel is a great metaphor, but its also a material fact for Steinem. She grew up with a father who was a traveling salesman, and unlike most such men, he took his family with him. For most of her childhood, there was no home, merely a series of stop-overs. This rootless existence would leave some children traumatized. Kids thrive on routine, and not all would be able to translate constant travel into a sense of the usual. But Steinem mostly remembers it as a positive attribute, and credits her parents for their capacity to question social norms during a time most Americans were madly conforming. The fact that she continued to live out of a suitcase once she was grown and on her own is the greatest testament of all to her upbringing, and to her response to it.There are oh, so many stories, some of which made me laugh out loud, and others that made me think. You can go winnow those out for yourself. And of course, my favorites may not be yours.But the one thing I can promise you is a really great read, one with depth, yet not difficult to access. Its friendly and feels as if we are having coffee with an old, dear friend, right at the table with one another. A circular table.You have to read this book.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,October 27, 2015,0679456201,My Life on the Road,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679456201,Random House,$16.74
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Outstanding Large Capacity Family Microwave,We've had this microwave for less than a week, but so far so good. The old one, which we bought at the local hardware store in 2005, went out with a flash and a sizzle. The air smelled like burning hair; it was quite convincing! Since we had a Sharp last time and it had been good for nine years, I thought we would just get another by the same maker, until I saw the amazon reviews for that brand. BIG change of plan! Glad we got this one, and here's what I like:* 1.6 cu ft capacity, just like our old one, which is the largest family size microwave (so to get larger, one would get a commercial machine, I guess)* white exterior looks nice with our white appliances but so far does not attract fingerprints* chrome &#34;start&#34; button and some of the other buttons slightly protrude from the face to avoid prints on machine* window is transparent while food is heating, but opaque when it isn't*popcorn button causes machine to weigh the bag, thus helping avoid burned-popcorn smell* dimensions are kitchen counter friendly*turn table is smooth and roomy enough for a large plate or a big bowl of food* features are clear* owner's manual is clear, not that you will need it* We have a few items we store on top of the microwave & below the counter. There is no vibrating sound from them when microwave is in use (but have not tried putting metal on top, only plastic, paper, and ceramic)Here are the things I don't like:* noisy* very, very heavy* 5 beeps. This may not bother you, but we got used to 3 beeps, and so right now 5 makes me wonder what's wrong.If you are a senior living alone and you order this machine, you will need to arrange for a strong person to bring it in, pick it up, and set it up for you. The high noise level does not bother us, but we all sleep at about the same times, and our microwave does not back onto anyone's bedroom. I think if this machine were in a staff room at work where meetings are held, it might be annoying and hard to hear over if you were seated close by, but for the average family, I don't think you can find a better microwave.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,January 10, 2015,B0009KMYGY,Panasonic NN-H765WF White 1250W 1.6 Cu.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Outstanding Civil War Nonfiction by Pulitzer Winner,Bruce Catton was known as a popular historian when he first published books about the American Civil War, because of his narrative nonfiction format. All of the books being released digitally now are ones previously published in a non-digital age. This reviewer hunted down Cattons three volume Centennial History of the Civil War at a used bookstore some time back, and although they were among the best I have ever read by anyone on this topic, I was convinced that anything he had published earlier on the subject was probably repackaged in this trilogy, and so I stopped reading Catton, thinking I was done. Thank goodness Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media posted the galley for this second volume of Cattons Army of the Potomac trilogy. Now that I am disabused, I will have to find the first and third volumes also, because Catton is so eloquent that he can spin ordinarily dry-sounding military history into as good a read as the most compelling fiction.Although his Civil War books are not written in academic format, there is no denying Cattons research or his credentials. He was one of the founders of American Heritage Magazine, and served as its senior editor until his death. During World War II, he was the US governments Director of Information for the War Production Board, then later worked in a similar capacity for the Department of the Interior and Department of Commerce.Frankly, in order to spin the story of the three battles that comprise most of this volume out in such a conversational manner, dropping anecdotes in at just the right moments and then carrying on so as to make us feel as if he is a journalist traveling with the Union forces and we are concealed cleverly in his knapsack, bespeaks a remarkable amount of research. Only after reading the whole thing, spellbound, did it occur to me that for every vignette he included to make the telling more personal and more interesting, he must have edited out ten or twenty. The result is a masterpiece.I came to this work as a former instructor in the field, and wished I had read his work in time to make use of it in the classroom. At the same time, it is sufficiently accessible that someone with no prior knowledge of the Civil War should be able to keep up just fine as long as they are able to read at the level of a high school senior or community college student. There is a definite bias toward the Union, which frankly is a requisite to my enjoyment of Civil War history. (Those that feel otherwise can go find Shelby Footes work.)I never in a thousand years thought I would even consider rereading some of this wars most painful battlesthe battle of Fredericksburg being perhaps the most prominent in this regardbut Catton has some little-told things to say about these battles, and in particular about Burnside and that Tammany Hall political general, Sickles, that I hadnt seen before. I had viewed Burnside as a failure from start to finish, but he makes a case that a lot of the mishandling of this situation was due to an ungainly Federal bureaucracy that wasnt good at receiving information and passing it along in a prompt, useful manner. It gave me pause, and reminded me that we should never assume we know enough about something to call ourselves experts.The Battle of Chancellorsville is likewise told in a manner fresh and readable, but the bulk of the text deals with that decisive, costly three day fight at Gettysburg. He gives an even-handed assessment of both Hooker and Meade, and again I learned some things I didnt know before.Cattons writing is so engaging that it is destined to live for a long, long time after he is gone, educating subsequent generations. I found myself resolved, at the end of this volume, to look for other galleys of his work to read and review, and when there are no more left, to track down those still missing next time I am out and about.For you, however, it is fortunate that Open Road is releasing this work digitally, so you wont have to turn out the shelves of every used bookstore in the US in order to locate it. It is available digitally now for your phone, computer, or e-reader, and is highly recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in the American Civil War.Simply brilliant.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 3, 2015,B015DJ7DDE,Glory Road (Army of the Potomac Trilogy Book 2),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015DJ7DDE,Open Road Media,$9.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Brilliant, Scholarly Study Sets the Record Straight,Morris considers DuBois the father of American sociology, and Morris is right. This is, of course, not the first time a Black man was robbed of credit for an accomplishment that was instead credited to a Caucasian American. It happens all the time. But until I ran across this scholarly study, I hadnt thought about DuBois and sociology because I had never studied the latter. As an admirer of DuBois historical and political role, I was drawn to this book when I found it on Net Galley. Thank you to that excellent site as well as University of California Press for the DRC, which I was given in exchange for an honest review.It is available for purchase now.DuBois was a venerable intellectual, an academic light years ahead of most Americans of any racial or ethnic background. He was the first Black man to graduate from Harvard University, and in addition to his graduate work there, he also studied in Berlin under such luminaries as Max Weber and others. In Europe, he was treated as an equal by those he studied with, and I found myself wondering a trifle sadlyfor him, not for us in the USAwhy he chose to return here. And the answer is so poignant, so sweetly naïve, that I wanted to sit down and cry when I found it. Because once he had the empirical facts with which to debunk the whole US-Negro-inferiority mis-school of mis-thought, he genuinely believed he would be able to elevate African-Americans to a state of equality in the USA by laying out the facts. The racists that created Jim Crow laws in the south and an unofficial state of cold racism that let Black folk in the Northern states know where they were welcome and where they were not, would surely roll away, he thought, if he could reasonably haul out his charts, his graphs, his statistics, and demonstrate flawlessly, once and for all, that discrimination against Black people was based on incorrect information.See what I mean? I could just cry for him.So although DuBois was the first American to go to Europe, study sociology, and return with more and better credentials than any American academic, he could not persuade anyone with authority to bring about change, was not even allowed to present his findings to anybody except Black people in traditional Black colleges, because another school of sociologists, the Chicago school, were busy promoting armchair theories based on little data, or bogus data, all showing that Black people simply were not smart enough to become professionals or take on anything above and beyond manual labor, and of course, he was Black, so he must not be that smart, right?Pause to allow your primal scream. Its galling stuff. Caucasian professors in Chicago had done a bit of reading, and with regard to Black people, decided that their craniums were too small to hold enough brain-iums. And just as there is one reactionary in every crowd that the newspapers will flock to in order to show that there is across-the-board agreement, so did Booker T Washington stand before any crowd that would listen to him (and the white academics just loved him), in order to say that it was the truth, that it was going to be a long time before the Negro was ready to do the difficult tasks involving critical thinking that had been so long denied him. Tiny steps; patience; tiny steps. Meanwhile, he extolled his fellow Black Americans to enroll their sons and daughters in programs teaching industrial education, so that they would be ready to do manual labor and put food on their families tables.All of the studies that backed this line of thinking were deductive, starting with the answer (inferior beings, manual labor) and then finding the questions to fit that answer. DuBois had done inductive research because he was searching for information rather than looking for a rational-sounding way to keep a group of people entrenched in an economic underclass.DuBois made the connection between the socialist theory he had studied and the material evidence before him: there were people getting rich off the backs of dark-skinned people, and they had a vested interest in maintaining Black folk as an underclass. Ultimately, he turned to political struggle, and that is how I knew about him, not as a sociologist, but as a Marxist. He also became the father of the interdisciplinary field of African-American studies. He helped found the NAACP.This scholarly work, like just about anything produced by a university press, is not light reading. Rather, the author presents his thesis and synopsis, and then carefully, brick by brick, starts back at the beginning to build his case. His documentation is flawless, and his sources are diverse and strong. There is some repetition in the text, but that is appropriate in this type of writing. He is not there to entertain the reader, but to provide an authentic piece of research that will stand the test of time, so there is a little bit of a house-that-jack-built quality to the prose.For serious admirers of DuBoiss work, this will be an excellent addition to your library. For those interested in sociology as a field, this is for you, too. And to those with a literacy level that permits you to access college-level material and who have a strong interest in African-American history and/or civil rights, this is a must-read.For these readers, I recommend, in addition, The Souls of Black Folk, which I had not regarded as sociology-based material until now, though I have read it twice; and a collection of speeches by DuBois, which I have been intending to review for some time, and which will soon grace this page of my blog.Morris has done outstanding work, and I like to think that if DuBois were here, he would be proud to see it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 19, 2015,0520276353,The Scholar Denied: W.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Hilarious Spoof Bound to Make Your Week Better...Hear?,That was absolutely ridiculous and just in the nick o time! Many thanks to Random House Alibi and Net Galley for the DRC. This second installment of the Darla Cavannah mystery series reads just fine as a stand-alone novel.I like to read several books at a time, and it was getting a little dark out there. The Blitzkrieg had broken out in the master bathroom, with Hitlers troops having overrun Belgium and Poland and on into France. On my e-reader, Bull Connor had sent huge attack dogs and fire hoses against the teenagers of Birmingham, and Dr. King already understood he would not make it out of the struggle alive. And by bizarre coincidence, Elvis was already perched on my nightstand. We were in the Vegas years, and Priscilla said that on the nights he wasnt performing, the man just ate and took pills out of boredom. And downstairs, even my fiction and humor were looking a trifle grim.In situations like that, some foot-stomping humor is not only welcome, but necessary. In Officer Elvis, someone has murdered an Elvis impersonator in Jackson, Mississippi. The case goes to Damn Yankee transplant Officer Darla Cavannah. Damn Yankees were the ones who came to the South and stayed. She is assisted by her newbie partner, Rita, who  might be a licorice stick short in the judgment department, but she aint afraid of the devil.Darla doesnt fit in well in Jackson, but she has to stay because her husband is the last doctor in the state that will help women who want to terminate a pregnancy. If he leaves, they lose their access. And as if we hadnt irony enough, Darla and her spouse are trying to get pregnant but who has time?I will grant that my fondness for this ham-handed satire is assisted by my own Yankee urban snobbery; and yet, I did have an Aunt Sister and not one but two Uncle Brothers of whom I was quite fond, thank you very much, and so if you are a Southerner, you just might enjoy this as much as I did bless your heart.It was a quick read and extremely accessible.Who doesnt need a laugh?

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Can't Miss It!,GM Ford writes really strong mystery novels. He takes the reader from falling-down-funny to high voltage suspense with a mere flip of the kindle page. As usual, this novel, a stand-alone called Threshold, is set here in Seattle.Mickey Dolan is a detective sergeant, and he is tasked with helping find the wife and two daughters of a powerful city councilman. But not all is as it appears. Much of the mystery centers around an albino woman named Grace. Grace has the ability to bring people out of comas; at one point, she says that these are people that werent really ready to die yet anyway, but this is the closest Ford has ever come to dabbling with the supernatural. It makes me wonder whether he will ever try writing horror. But that is speculation on my part; here, it is just one element of a really great tale of suspense.Back to our story. Grace, her mother Eve, and the missing family members appear to be tucked into an anonymous, generally industrial chunk of land in the industrial Duwamish heartland of Seattle. Why are they there of all places, and why was it so impossible to find them? Why is Grace so reclusive, and what does she have to do with the missing family members?At some point, the credibility question pops up. Im a big believer in facts. I like the material world, and when things start to go woo-woo, as when supernatural gifts are introduced into the plot, my forehead wrinkles. Whats up with the weird stuff?But when all is said and done, a strong writer can make me believe just about anything. Just as Steve King convinced me that there was a haunted clown in the sewer, Ford got me to buy Grace Pressmans quirky little talent. Because when all is said and done, if the story is good enough, we will want to believe it in order to keep the magic flowing, and thats how this tale was for me.Note that there is no thank you to the publishers here. I found this little gem for less than a Lincoln on Amazon, and I said oh hell yes. I almost never pay full jacket price for a book these days; however, this one was both cheaper than usual, and by an author I really enjoy, so I straight-up bought it.So should you.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,May 16, 2015,1477822178,Threshold,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477822178,Thomas & Mercer,$8.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Littlefield's Best is Riveting,Sophie Littlefield, author of the Bad Day series (A Bad Day for Sorry, etc) has hit a new level of excellence with The Guilty One. Many thanks to Net Galley and Gallery Books for the DRC! This book goes up for sale today, and if you love a good novel, this one is for you.Our chief protagonists are Maris and Ron. Maris is Callas mother or she was. Calla is dead now. The court has convicted Karl of her murder, a heartbroken, enraged loss of control over a bad teenage breakup. Ron is Karls father, and as we open our first setting, he is considering jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. At the last minute he decides to phone Maris, and ask her whether to jump or not.theguiltyoneIt shows a good deal about Rons character, weak and lacking in integrity, that he not only phones Karls victims mother to dump the responsibility on her, but also wears a windbreaker to the bridge because his travel guide mentions that it is cool and windy there, even in warm weather.The last time I read Littlefields work, it was the Bad Day series. The first book won multiple awards and was deeply satisfying, a savvy, witty dig at domestic abuse. The same topic enters this discussion in a more oblique fashion. In her earlier series, she seemed to lose momentum as the series unfolded, and it appeared to me that she couldnt decide whether she wanted to write a series that was mostly of the detective fiction genre, or mostly romance. Here, she has taken a giant step away from mystery and detective fiction, and this straight-up fictional story is told with grace, maturity, and authority. Its obvious right there in the first few pages. I was reading a handful of galleys at the time, and my first note to myself was See now, this is good writing.Maris has lost her marriage, and at first it appears to be a consequence of Callas deathso few couples can experience the death of a child and stay togetherbut as the story progresses, it becomes clear that a split was in the works long before this. And Maris makes a decision that resonates with me. She drops everything and everyone, more or less, and without thinking, going purely on instinct, starts over in a new place, with a greatly reduced standard of living. At first I wonder whether Maris is merely slumming, seeing how the other half lives, but deep down, I have to trust Littlefield not to do anything so shabby, and she doesnt. Maris is the one we root for, the one that drives the plot forward and pulls us in.Ron and Deb have stayed together as Karl has gone through the trial and been found guilty, but the strain is there. Ron starts out entirely believable and not very likeable. He never becomes the stand-up individual that Maris is, but he is a dynamic character, complicated and interesting. He undergoes a lot of change as the story progresses.Throughout this riveting novel, there was never a moment when the veil lifted and I recalled that these characters werent real. I raced toward the end with a sense that I had to see how it came out, and then when it was over, I felt a sense of loss, wanting to turn another page and find Maris still there so I could check in with her, like a good friend. And that is ultimately the hallmark of great writing.Get online. Take a bus. Get in the car. Hijack a planeokay, maybe notbut do what you need to do in order to get a copy of this accessible, compelling new fiction. Littlefield rocks it. You can order it now, so you will be able to read it right away. If you do, you too will want to stand up and cheer!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 11, 2015,1476757836,The Guilty One,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757836,Gallery Books,$11.40
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Old-School Science Fiction Stories to Keep Your Mind Flexible,Science fiction is a big house with a lot of rooms. Turtledove has managed to leave his calling card in almost all of them, and includes a couple of thought-provoking essays as well. Once again, I send hearty and heart-felt thanks to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media for permitting me to glimpse this collection in advance, and free of charge. It goes on sale in August of this year.I used to read more science fiction than I do now; one reason is that a big branch of it has veered into tech-speak that requires more knowledge than I possess in that field. But another reason also occurred to me as I read these stories, sometimes voraciously and at other times more tentatively, and that is that sci fi requires a flexible mind, and as we get older, our brains don't bend as readily. Now that I know it, I will require myself to read it more frequently, because they say to use it or lose it, and I'm not ready to surrender yet. I did find that there were too many characters and relationships introduced in too little time for me to keep up with &#34;Down in the Bottomlands&#34;. This one won the Hugo Award, so I am fairly sure the flaw is mine rather than his. Maybe those of you that are younger and more oriented toward this genre will find it more to your taste.However, I loved &#34;Hoxbomb&#34;, a thought-provoking twist on the notion of computers having intelligence of their own. And I actually laughed out loud during parts of the first selection, &#34;Father of the Groom&#34;, and also &#34;Birdwitching&#34;. The temerity of &#34;Under St. Peters&#34; left me nearly breathless with admiration; the guy will end up on the Banned Books list for sure if this collection sells well.Maybe most intriguing of all is the subgenre of alternate history. Turtledove's essay made me want to roll up my sleeves and write again. How much fun could it be?All told, this is a meaty collection that the sci fi lover should read when it's possible to do so. I promise you'll have a great time, and stretch your mental muscles in the process.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 25, 2015,1504009428,We Install: And Other Stories,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1504009428,Open Road Media Sci-Fi & Fantasy,$12.23
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Symmetry and Precision,Katherine Neville is one of those people that does everything well. Shes been a model, a computer wiz, a photographer, and shes also an impressive author. I was lucky enough to read this first in the series since Open Road Integrated Media has just re- published it digitally. Thank you to them, and to Net Galley, for permitting me a free copy in exchange for my review. This book was released Tuesday, and is for sale now.Our protagonist, Cat Velis, lives in New York; the time is 1970, at the height of the Vietnam War. Cat lives in New York City and works for Con Edison. Since she has refused to do something illegal for her boss, who is engaged in some sidelines back-scratching with a client, she is being shipped off to Algeria. Before she can pack, however, a fortune teller warns her that she is in great danger. She scoffs, but less than a week and two corpses later, her irritation has turned to fear. She calls in her mentor, a mysterious man that seems to travel Gandalf-like, practically appearing in thin air. He comes and talks to her in much the same way as the fortune teller did, but he also tells her that she has to go to Algeria and fulfill her destiny.Transposed with this story is a tale that takes place around the time of the French Revolution. The Montglane Abbey is closing its doors because of the Bill of Seizure. Buried beneath its floor for centuries was a legendary chess set whose worth is beyond anyones wildest dreams. Composed of huge gems, gold, and silver, it is all the more valuable for a formula that its individual parts, when put together, have etched on their undersides. Is it a secret weapon? Is it a supernatural curse that is activated when the pieces are together? The Abbess only knows that she must separate the pieces and get them out of France, along with herself. She takes herself to Russia, to her closest friend, who is Catherine the Great. From there, the parallel story to Cats unfurls itself. Eventually the two part of the story come together.This is ordinarily not the sort of historical fiction that attracts me; there are really well-developed, highly sympathetic royal characters, and then there are the savage, dirty masses. It grates. While its true that the French working class and peasantry really did tear royals from their splendid carriages and either kill them on the spot or take them off to the Jacobins to be killed later, Neville paints the royals in such an idealized fashion that the reader, if not already informed, might wonder indeed just why the masses would do such a thing? Unless, of course, its in their inferior DNA. I ground my teeth and read on.Add a reference to the Freemasons and the number 666, and I was ready to hurl my kindle across the room! But I had an obligation to the publisher, and so I persevered, and I am glad I did, because what Neville does with the plot is quite cunning. If one were going to chart the book into a grid, it would correlate with the grid that is part of the story itself. And if this makes no sense whatsoever to you, all I can tell you is that you have to read the book and watch closely. Watch for the patterns; this is actually slick as hell! And so in the end, I was glad I had seen it through. Though maybe more famous people are worked into one novel than is natural, the elegance of the plot itself (and the chess detail), rather than historical veracity or character development, is what sustains this substantial work.The readers understanding of this hyper-literate story will be aided by knowledge of chess. In fact, I found myself taking a few notes, though I havent played in years! Those unschooled in chess can also enjoy the book, but I do not recommend this book to anyone for whom English is not the mother tongue. The vocabulary and historical references will be so much work for you that you wont enjoy it.But I did.Recommended to those that appreciate symmetry and precision in a novel.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 25, 2015,B00YTFTCGK,The Eight,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YTFTCGK,Open Road Media Mystery & Thriller,$6.83
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Sheer Terror in the Snowbound North,Meg is alone with a 12 year old in her isolated cabin during a Canadian blizzard, when three escaped prisoners land on her doorstep, one of them injured. She helps dress the wound of the injured man, but then is held hostage, along with Jid, who is like a son to her, and her puppy. This mystery is the seventh in a series, but it was the first I had read, and it is easy to follow as a stand-alone thriller. Thank you to Net Galley and Dundurn Publishers for the DRC, and my apologies in being so tardy with my review. The book has been released and is available for purchase now.Those that enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption or that are fans of Val McDermids mystery series will probably enjoy this story a great deal.Each of us has a threshold of tolerance for how much terror and violence they can stand in a novel before it stops being entertaining and starts to be just scary and violent. Thats what happened to me here. Roughly eighty percent of this book is set in and near Megs cabin, with one aborted effort at escape after another; the writer wants us to also be worried about the puppy, and she played the card well, maybe too well for me. The small moments in which interesting tidbits of Algonquin culture are released, or in which one of the escapees does some small, compassionate deed are eclipsed by the sheer weight of the isolation and brutality present, and I finally got to where I could not stand it anymore around the 65 percent mark, and I skipped to the end and traced it back. That said, I also know that my own tolerance is lower than most. I watch very little television and few movies, and so a little goes a long way where I am concerned.Harlick deserves a lot of credit for being able to spin a linear plot line with a limited setting, time span, and for most of the story with a limited number of characters. She never loses the readers interest or wanders off on a tangent; her facility with setting is good, and the tangibility of the place and people add to the terror experienced by the reader on behalf of the protagonist.Scary-as-hell fiction from a series writer worth following in years to come.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 11, 2015,B00VM4ROIO,A Cold White Fear: A Meg Harris Mystery,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VM4ROIO,Dundurn,$7.55
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Great New Whodunnit,What a treat! They say all stories have already been told once, but Im telling you, this one hasnt. Oh, trust me! And my thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for a wonderful DRC. This one will be up for sale November 3.Some may recall the TV series The Streets of San Francisco; the show was based on a set of police procedurals by Carolyn Weston. Characters Casey Kellog and Al Krug became TV characters Steve Keller and Mike Stone. In bringing the series back to us in the twenty-first century, new co-author Robin Burcell was asked to update it, since some of the over-the-top methods used originally could get a cop fired these days, and the old methods would not resonate with the public. Burcell has a lengthy background in law enforcement, and now I know that she is also a capable novelist. The pages flew by, and I enjoyed her improvement of the old series.As the story commences, there have been a series of murders at famous landmarks in San Francisco, and it has been inferred by the media that tourists are at risk. While sometimes life may be cheap, the tourist industry is key to the local economy, and theres heavy political pressure set to find someone and solve this crime, preferably accurately, but if not just get someone, haul them in, and charge them.So when Marcies neighbor and good friend Trudy turns up dead, there is speculation. Has she been a victim of this killer, or is it a copycat killing?We find out right at the get go that Marcie knows a thing or two. For example, she knows that Trudy and her husband are getting a divorce; they are no longer in love. And Marcie also knows that her buddy has been spending some private time with Marcies husband. And so while Trudy and her soon-to-be-ex are going to sell their house as part of dividing the spoils of a marriage gone bad, Marcie wont sell her house. Because it is her house, along with the eucalyptus grove out in the backyard. Her grandfather left her the house, and he left her the trees. He used to tell her that this humble, quiet spot out back was the last good place, and Marcie wont part with it. Not ever. Not even to increase the propertys valuefor herself and also for friend Trudyby making their homes bay view property. Her grandfather preferred the trees to the water view, and so does Marcie.Its time to go jogging with Trudy, but Marcie hangs back and hides for a bit. We arent quite sure why, apart from the fact that she is suspicious that things are not what they seem to be. Trudys been a little strange toward her lately. And what do you know Trudy dies on the morning jog before Marcie catches up to her.This is a really accessible story, and I thought I ought to be able to solve the mystery. Goodness knows I read enough of them! And yet, I really didnt get it. The author doesnt pull the rug from beneath the reader by introducing a lot of new information at the end, or any of the other unfair devices writers occasionally use in order to make their storys ending a certain surprise; I had a reasonable shot at it, but I didnt get it. And I loved the ending!The charactersthe experienced, fatherly, crafty interrogator Al Krug, and his ambitious partner, Casey Kellog, are well developed and personable, but their personal lives dont distract from the problems at hand. There are a couple of red herrings, but the plot is essentially linear and easy to follow.All told, this one is a humdinger, and you should read it!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 3, 2015,B013XBJ5TO,The Last Good Place,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013XBJ5TO,Brash Books,$4.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Greenland Setting Fascinates,Sloan Wilson was a veteran of the second world war, and he served in the Greenland Patrol. Here he uses his knowledge of the place to create an entirely unique setting. In fact, Greenland itself is very nearly a character in Ice Brothers. This book deserves 3.5 stars , and as usual I have rounded it upward, as I generally do when I am unable to denote a half-star. Thank you to Net Galley and Open Road Media for the ARC.At the start, I was torn. Although I enjoy both historical fiction and military history a great deal, I deliberately avoid World War II stories that take place in the Pacific theater. My reason is that I don't like to see Japanese people referred to with racist slurs, even though I know that at the time it was commonplace among many Caucasian members of Allied nations. The&#34;J&#34; word is every bit as offensive to me as the &#34;N&#34; word is. I understand that there was a time when Euro-Americans freely bandied both terms about. However, most editors have the sense to remove it and substitute a less heinous term these days, unless the use of the term serves an important purpose in the story. (For example, check the use of anti-Semitic language by the villainous skipper, Lowery, against whom we develop the bright and personal Nathan Green, who hears his name misused one time too many and vows to change it back to &#34;Greenburg&#34; once he is back in the US.)So I wanted to read this book, about which little description was available, for two reasons: one was the setting, which will serve as the hook for a lot of readers. What did I know about Greenland? I didn't even know it was Danish territory! A trip down my upstairs hallway to the large world map hanging on the wall there confirmed the story's assertion: sure enough, right there underneath the word &#34;Greenland&#34;, writ large albeit in parenthesis, it says &#34;Denmark&#34;. How typically North American of me to have assumed it was Canadian! I surely needed to learn more, and good historical fiction is the most enjoyable way to learn many things.The second reason for my interest was that it was described as a story in which the protagonist hunts for a Nazi ship. GOOD. So, Japan is unlikely to surface, and I can comfortably read without the story exploding in my face.So when I hit the &#34;J&#34; word, which was not at all important to the story, but thrown in perhaps as set dressing or to set the tone of the story, I was shocked. The further extraneous reference by a character in the story who asserted that &#34;...those little yellow bastards can't fight&#34; made it worse. (Of course, there was no reference to the internment of Americans of Japanese descent; extraneous material here is limited to that which is ugly and prejudicial.) I told myself I would take a break and read it a little bit later.Every time I remembered my obligation to Open Road and Net Galley, I picked up my e-reader, but I had other galleys and other obligations, and each time I thought I would give Sloan's work another try, I found myself reading a different ARC instead. This persisted for over a month; I can usually finish and review a book faster than that, unless asked to hold my review for publication.Finally, I had to make a choice. I went back and reread the introduction. I steeled myself and forged onward. It's a good thing that the plot, setting, and character development were so well done, because that word was used about ten times, and it never contributed a single thing to the story itself.All right; let's look at the story, then.I know very little about watercraft, and was delighted with the accessible, instructive manner Sloan used to clarify the various types of ships and boats and the nautical terms that are most commonly used. I was also surprised and bemused by the stratification of resources apportioned to the Coast Guard as opposed to the Navy, with the Coast Guard serving as the poor cousin that receives whatever the Navy doesn't need. The ingenious ways in which our fictional Coast Guard officers and crew work around the lack of resources, often not at all legally, must have had at least some basis in fact. I found it really interesting, and it drew me closer to the story as I sympathized with the men on the trawler (The Arluk).Sloan's approachable way of describing Greenland's weather and geography were also really useful.Greenland is a dangerous place to sail. Today it is different than it was during that time period. I did a web crawl and was horrified to see how much of it has melted now. Back then, at least, it was possible for a sturdy ship to weave its way into a fjord (which is like a peninsula made of water that pokes into the ice mountains), and then have everything freeze, and the ice might crush the ship and its crew against the mountains. The ever-present tension of a possible encounter with Nazis created a sense of suspense that made the book hard to put down after a certain point was reached, even with the racist terminology, which continued to grate and became worse when Paul and Nathan discussed the loyalties of the &#34;Eskies&#34; or &#34;Eskimos&#34; with the Danish inhabitants. The Inuit people were treated as cartoon characters, and the static, repeated description of their faces as round and copper-colored and their mentality as &#34;child-like&#34; made me wonder where this capable writer's otherwise outstanding skill with varied language had gone. Yet the story still tugged at my interest, and so I made a note in my e-reader and forged on.Another facet of the story that kept me reading late into the night was the ambiguity of the Danish residents of Greenland, and in particular, the character of Brit. Were these folks really held by force by the Nazis that we could not even see, or were they complicit? Whose side were they on? Would Brit betray Paul to them? When he acceded to her request to see the ship, and she curiously nosed into every odd corner, asking technical questions about the engine and radar, I wanted to pick her up bodily and toss her off the ship!Sloan was a strong writer for a very different time. His work could still be really compelling, but I doubt I am the only reader who will take exception to the racial slurs that do nothing to drive the plot or develop the characters. I hope either his heirs or his editors will go in and update this work. It can only improve the story to do so.Recommended, with the qualifications mentioned.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,January 3, 2015,B00P8KUEKI,Ice Brothers: A Novel,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P8KUEKI,Open Road Media,$9.99

When did this happen?This is lightweight plastic material and may not last more than one season. I would still rather have it than a heavier metal construction. My small dog doesn't drop a big load, and I don't want to fool with heavy tools. Using this, I can roam around our small yard and pick up 3 or 4 piles, drop them behind a bush where nobody will step on them, and then leave it in a corner on the porch for next time. I sprayed it with Pam vegetable spray before using it and no dog poop sticks to it when I am done, so to the eye it looks clean as a whistle.If I have to buy a replacement in a year, I will still feel I got my money's worth.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,February 26, 2015,B0006L0VS4,Lee's Stool Tool Clean up System, Small Tray With Rake,Pet Supplies,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006L0VS4,Lee's Pet Products,$21.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Gluttony for the Voracious Reader,Well of course its a five-star book; these stories are the winners! And having just read them, and changed my mind over and over as to which was my real favorite, rather like being at a banquet and being served all of ones favorite foods, I was at something of a loss to find one that rose above the others until the very end, and if I had to choose one of them, that would be it. That one, or Russell Bankss A Permanent Member of the Family, a poignant, terrible, magnificent story that I had actually already read and reviewed about a year ago in a collection by that author. So, it goes without saying that Banks is a giant, and I just sort of set him aside with the knowledge that he was untouchable, and then read and compared the rest. But why take my word for it? Dont just listen to me! Look here at how Ive rambled on forever without mentioning that I got this book scot free (lucky me) from Net Galley and Knopf Doubleday Publishers in exchange for an honest review. This outstanding collection will be available for purchase September 15. I dont know how you can bear to wait that long!Okay, lets try this again. See, its almost impossible to compare them, but here are some things I can say about the collection as a whole: first, that it is a multicultural collection, but it doesnt appear to me as if anybody laid out special rules that said anyone had to vote for this, that, the other culture. Theyre all really strong. There was never a moment where something went thud and I wondered how the hell that story got in here. I obsessively made notes on my kindle whenever I came to something that was funny, interesting, oroh especially this!when I found incredibly effective, purposeful figurative language. If I still taught (well okay, if I still taught, I wouldnt have time to read galleys), but if I still taught, I would get a good hard copy of this book to slide under the projector in order to illuminate what the various types of figurative language look like when theyve been used well. If I still taught and had an actual book buying budget, I would get an entire class set so that students could go through and find the passages for themselves, which is actually a much more powerful way to teach, and then Id have them write their own stories and be gob-smacked by how much they had improved over the course of a week or so, just from reading a few choice, selected stories.But I dont teach anymore, and I do read a lot of books and write a lot of reviews, and I am telling you, this is better than what I generally read, and Ive been reading good stuff, too. The last story in the collection, Birdsong from the Radio, by Elizabeth McCracken, is not only outstanding, but its chilling, horrifying, and absolutely fabulous read-aloud material for the month of October.But if, like me, you no longer have anyone except other adults surrounding you now, you should get this collection for yourself. Read it on the beach; in a chilly, air-conditioned motel room; or snug by the fire this fall. Because this is what excellence looks like. Its gluttony for the voracious reader, and extremely tempting, I should think, for the reluctant one.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,October 4, 2015,B00U4VBNX8,The O.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Good Nuts and Bolts Bio of Grant,This brass-tacks biography of US Grant, who served as Americas finest Civil War general and also two terms as US president, was originally written for young adults. Now it is something of an anomaly, and yet not a bad read for the right audience. Thank you, thank you to Open Road Integrated Media and to Net Galley for providing me with the DRC. This book is available for purchase now.Reading this nifty little book reminded menot entirely happilyof how much sturdier literacy in the United States stood during the 1950s, when this biography was originally written, compared to now. True, it was a less egalitarian, less inclusive school house that could throw this level of reading at its teenagers, and that is a different debate for a different day. Right now, I just have to tell you that Cattons boiled-down biography is going to be over the heads of most high school students. In addition, there are a couple of slang terms no longer in use that may confuse the reader. I understood one of themand I was born in the late 50sbut another phrase left me scratching my head. My two fields, when teaching, were literature and US history, primarily the American Civil War and government, so if I dont get it, then high school kids will miss some of it also. The book could be used for honors students, most likely, but is no longer ideally suited to high school students.However, I can see its use today for community college students, and also for adults who are not doing research and dont care to see Mr. Cattons sources or argue his perspective. He takes a few enormously controversial aspects of Grants life and makes his own pronouncements, some bold, some bland, with absolutely not one shred of evidence to back them up, apart from his own excellent reputation, and so scholars in the field are more likely to find his Civil War trilogies more satisfying than this little nugget. But for the history buff who just wants a thumbnail sketch, one book and were finished thanks, this could be it. It is certainly less of a meal than Grants own memoir; also, unlike Grants inarguably excellent memoir, Catton addresses the rumors about Grant and liquor that Grant himself refused to even discuss.Catton focuses primarily on the Civil War years, which I believe is the right way to remember the man, but he also talks about the setting into which Grant was born, and in a relatively short amount of text provides us with the lifestyle and expectation of the average American farmer, which is what the vast majority of Americans were at that time. He carries us through Grants time at West Point, then through the wars with Mexico.He takes apart and casts aside, brick by brick, the nasty allegations that Grants detractors made then and in contemporary times, and shines an authoritative light on them. What about Grant and the booze? Was Grant really a bad businessman who lost his own money and that of other people? Was he really Grant-the-butcher, as a brief but ugly period in revisionism charged, willing to plow willy-nilly into any and every battle regardless of the number of soldiers lives lost? What about his presidency, and the scandal that clouded it?Grant is one of my heroes, and I appreciate the way Catton defends him here. I particularly was interested in his very convincing defense of Grant as businessman. I found Catton slightly abrasive in his tone toward Grants defense of the rights of African-Americans during Reconstruction; it was clearly this, rather than anything else, that caused the glow of his wartime glory to dim, because the Klan and Southern white reactionaries were absolutely hell-bent on creating a stratified society in which the Black man did not have equal rights to those of Caucasians, and one determined U.S. president was not able to stem that tide. Thats really what Grant was up against, and what tarnished his reputation. Catton feels he should have been more, um, flexible. I personally am pleased that he was willing to ride his principles to hell and back if need be and that was about what happened.I find it so sad, so ironic that the vast overload of expensive cigars sent to General Grant by patriotic admirers are what most likely lead to his death; throat cancer checked him out of this world only 48 hours after his memoir was completed.Although there are no citations for the facts provided in the text, there is a nice little index that will prove useful to students.Recommended for adults at the community college level, and to history buffs who just want to read one relatively simple biography of Grant.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 3, 2015,B015DJ7D70,U.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Nixon During Eisenhower Administration--Meh,Gellmans biography covers Nixons tenure as Vice President of the USA under President Dwight Eisenhower; he covers the election campaign beforehand as well as the famous Checkers Speech. Thank you to Net Galley and Yale University Press for the DRC, which I took in exchange for an honest review.It is a little bit hard to be sure about this work, because the galley I got was so rough that it was difficult to judge its fluency. I settled on 3 stars rather than 4 stars because I saw some issues with organization, small tidbits that only marginally bore mentioning showed up in multiple chapters.That said, its a good resource for anyone looking to study the Eisenhower administration or Nixons early years in government. I learned some things I didnt know, and I have read my share (and maybe your share too!) of Nixon-related literature. Gellman has done a great job with research, and even offers pictures of primary documents, such as Ikes notes during Nixons famous speech, at the end of the book.I learned that the USA of that time period was a much more innocent one than that which we live in now. The Checkers Speech is one good example: now it is regarding laughingly as a mawkish bit of theater, but what is not widely publicized anymore is that the American public was asked to respond as to whether he should stay on the ticket, and they flooded the Republican headquarters and media centers with letters that supported him 350 to 1.Now that it is known that he used public dollars for personal gain as president, I had rather assumed he had done the same during the funding crisis in question, but actually, back then he was guilty of nothing. The donations that were made were a travel fund, because the Nixons didnt have the money to travel around the country campaigning. Donors pitched in for their air fare, cab fare, and hotels. There was no law regarding campaign spending limits back then; no law was violated.As vice president, Nixon had more responsibilities, and occupied a position of greater trust, than most who occupied the same position. He was sent overseas, not only as a good will ambassador or ribbon cutter, but to do unpleasant, tricky things, like talking down the heads of state in South Korea and Taiwan. In addition, Ike never cared to do his own dirty work domestically, and so if someone needed to be officially taken apart, there was a good chance Nixon would be tapped for the job. He had an unstoppable work ethic and was unflinchingly loyal.If Nixons vice presidency is of interest to you, get a copy of Gellmans book. It goes up for sale in late November, so you can also consider it as a holiday gift if someone you know would appreciate it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 21, 2015,0300181051,The President and the Apprentice: Eisenhower and Nixon, 1952-1961,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300181051,Yale University Press,$28.97
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Great for Small Items, Casual Household,We are city folk, so a tiny downstairs half bathroom doubles as a laundry room. No medicine cabinet; no storage other than a cabinet under the sink. And most of the time that's okay, but when I want to put on some lipstick before leaving the house, or an overnight guest stays on the sofabed, there's nowhere to tuck little stuff away. There's also no wall space to put in a cabinet; the mirror over the sink, towel rack, and fire extinguisher pretty much eat that half of the room, and the other side is laundry shelving over the washer/dryer.I got this because it just barely fits on the sink counter, and really small stuff--lipstick, q tips, chapstick, small coins or buttons can go into the drawers. As you can see, it is transparent, which is great if you are putting in attractive things or don't care what folks see; not a great place to put your condoms or personal medications! But it's fine for us. It's lightweight, and if I knock it onto the vinyl floor even once, I suspect it will break. If a drawer is left empty, your guest can just barely stick a toothbrush and a mini toothpaste in there, but the toothbrush has to go in diagonally unless it is child sized.It would also serve well in a walk-in closet, to put extra buttons that come with clothing, safety pins, and other small notions. One small string of beads would fill a drawer. A really big string of beads would not fit.The drawers slide very smoothly, no trouble at all.For our purposes, it is dandy. Cheap, functional, and it fits in a tight space. If you are a decorator and want something that looks higher-end, this is not your box. You'll have to pay actual money. Also, I would not try to cram the drawers fuller than they are intended to be; see the dimensions advertised.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 5, 2015,B004KKXA58,InterDesign 3 Drawer Storage Organizer, Clear,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KKXA58,InterDesign,$16.65
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Strong Fiction by a Promising New Writer,Jack is an artist living in New York City. Sometimes he sleeps in the apartment where he lives with his family. Sometimes he sleeps in his studio, when his work is really going strong. Just as sometimes he sleeps with his wife, whereas sometimes, he sleeps with whoever. This story is about the fallout that occurs when one of the random women he has taken up with, then discarded comes back with a vengeance, and though she intends to punish Jack through his wife, instead she ends up punishing him and his wife through their children, who are the unhappy recipients of the series of randy e-mails the woman hes just jettisoned prints up and delivers to his building. My god, my god. And before I go farther, let me say thank you to Net Galley and Random House for allowing me a sneak peek.Jack and his latest-fling have been prolific writers, it seems. It takes a large, somewhat weighty box to hold all the hideous missives that have passed between the two of them. And though its a rotten thing hes done to his wife Deb, it slips out early on that she has married him only after dating him while he was married to someone else. Hey, what goes around, comes around.Unfortunately, Jack is sufficiently garrulous enough with his recent conquest that he shares his childrens names with her, and when eleven year old Kay accepts the box to take upstairs, she is thinking that it is nearly her birthday, and perhaps what is inside is a gift that she cant wait two weeks to know about. And then one of the papers on top of the pile has her name on it. It isnt underlined, nor in bold or colored ink, but ones name tends to jump out at one. And so the steamy sex talk she is way too young to see in any context whatsoever is accompanied by the sentence, I know about Kay.Its almost enough to permanently traumatize a kid. Well, maybe we can forget that almost.The events are so horrible that any sensible reader would turn away rather than face what comes next, but Pierpont has a fresh, immediate writing style that pulls one in, almost to the extent that we care about those kids as if they were our own. We keep reading because we have to know what happens to them.Several times I grew angry enough with Jack that I found myself senselessly typing angry retorts into my kindle comments. Nobody sees that stuff but me, but typing seemed better than waking my spouse to inveigh against this self-absorbed jerk, this swine who has the nerve at first to blame Kay for reading mail not meant for her eyes. Oh please!And when Deb equivocates, I want to smack her, too. Sure, I know I said that what goes around comes around, but once you have children, the whole equation is altered, and you have to act immediately on their behalf. She feels a little sorry for Jack at first, at the alienation his children display toward him, and I just want to shake her. Dont feel bad for him, the pig! Feel bad for your kids! Hello?The kids are really what the book is all about, what makes it worth reading. They arent little big-eyed Holly Hobby dolls, but both innocent and insolent, naughty and adorable, disturbed, devastated, and resilient as well. They flounder; they struggle. And when the story ends, the spell isnt really broken until one accepts that they are fictional, because believe me, the whole thing feels so very real.Pierpont is a damn good writer. She will be a force to be reckoned with in the literary world, a writer to watch. I cant wait to read whatever is next!What a fascinating book, by a strong new author.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 13, 2015,0812995228,Among the Ten Thousand Things: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812995228,Random House,$17.77
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Maybe for New Yorkers?,My three stars here are a compromise. Try as I did, I could not enjoy this novel, but it is marketed more toward New Yorkers than others, and although I like a good urban setting and have enjoyed New York, have friends and family from there, I dont live there and never have. Also, the plot is oriented toward the art worldMarie and Simone are senior citizens studying art, and there are a lot of references to art that went right past me. So if you are a New Yorker interested in both the history of Manhattan and art history, then this might be your book. And thank you once more to Net Galley and Scribner for permitting me to access a galley in advance for the purposes of review.Some writers have a taut, urgent writing style that leaves their readers perched, sometimes literally, on the edges of their seats. Some have a sumptuous, painterly style that takes its time, and one should sink back into a soft place by the fire or in summer, perhaps on the beach, and prepare to drink it all in. Walbert uses the latter style, and I wanted to sink back, wanted to drink it all in, but for me, the description was the whole thing. I found myself bogged down with description that did not appear to serve much plot, and it never felt as if it was moving forward. There was a lot of inner dialogue, remembrance, but so very little actually seemed to happen. I have never found myself dissatisfied for this particular reason, and so I thought surely it must be me. I went back and started it over three times, and in the end, I came away frustrated. The over-long footnotes (in fiction?) were a distraction, and the style, in the end, felt pretentious.But then again, remember that I know almost nothing about art. I know of a couple dozen famous paintings, and I thought I would like this story because I loved The Goldfinch, whose most critical scene is set in an art museum. And maybe that was my own problem as well: trying to follow a Pulitzer winner like The Goldfinch is indeed a heavy burden. I came away from reading that book and Toni Morrison, so perhaps my expectations were a trifle high. But I cant honestly say I liked this book.If you are a New Yorker, especially an older one, and if you lean toward the art world, you may enjoy this novel, by an award-winning writer. It has just been released, so if you would like to order it, you can do that now.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 11, 2015,1476799326,The Sunken Cathedral: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476799326,Scribner,$17.14
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Best Case Available for This Phone; Good Father's Day Gift,I got an Otterbox for my own phone, and my spouse took a look and said he wanted one, too. This is the best made phone case you can buy. The rubberized surface extends past the glass face of the phone, so unless you drop it off a cliff onto waiting boulders below, it should protect your phone. Might not survive being run over by a car or truck either. But if you get this phone and use common sense, you should be good to go.The face plate that resembles a heavy duty packing crate is mostly not useful, because you can't use the phone without removing it except to charge the phone, for which there is a little opening in the side of the case. You can play music just fine, too, as the case allows for that, so you could turn on a playlist and then snap on the face plate, and it would play your music anyway.But for most uses, take the face plate off, put the phone in your pocket, and you're golden. We don't use head phones often, but there is also an opening where you can attach those if you choose.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 5, 2015,B00GB39IJE,OtterBox Defender Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Black,Cell Phones & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GB39IJE,none,none
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Timely Social Message in Approachable Mystery Format Highly Recommended,Everybody in the country got color on the brain white folks trying brown themselves up and looking down on everything that aint white at the same time; black folks puttin each other down for being too black; brown folks trying to make sure nobody mistakes them for black; yellow folks trying to convince themselves theyre white.Timely? Why yes! So isnt it interesting that this book was initially published in 1994?My many thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for a fascinating DRC.The Blanche White series is a mystery series, but Neely uses this approachable medium as a forum to discuss race, primarily the unspoken caste system that has developed about and among people of color in the United States.In our story, Blanche is invited to visit a black resort on the coast of Maine. Her sister is dead, and Blanche is now a parent to her two children. This book is the second in the series, and we are told that during the first, Blanche had come away from a bad situation with a bundle of money that she dedicated to the excellent education of her two elementary-aged children. Now Taifa, her daughter, is anxious that she use a hair relaxer to straighten her fro. Its bad enough that Mama Blanche is eggplant-dark. Bad enough that she is not part of the black petit bourgeoisie, but a working class woman a maid, no less! And so Taifas loyalty is divided; she wants to fit in with these pale, wealthy folk, but she also loves her Mama Blanche. Blanche in turn is torn. She doesnt fry her hair, but she does have a conversation about it with the children.Meanwhile we learn that a woman named Faith is dead, and it may not have been accidental. Like Agatha Christies Murder On the Orient Express, it seems just about everyone here has a reason to want Faith dead. That isnt Blanches business, of course until it is.I do love a good mystery, and will cheerfully sit down to a tower of Blanche books if I can find them.The cover is what drew me initially; I looked at the wide hips and thought this was surely my kind of woman.But race is more than academically interesting for me; my own family is blended and my Caucasian children grown and gone, which has left me the only white person in the house. Most days I dont think about it, but for years, planning the family vacation was both eye-opening and interesting. One child at home is Caucasian and Japanese; the other (was) African-American. We enjoyed Yellowstone, but heartily regret having been forced to stop for gas in the Idaho panhandle, an experience we will avoid in the future. Now my African-American son is grown and out of the house, but I will never look at the world the same way. Its been a real education.Surely anyone who looks at this books title understands that s/he is in for more than just a mystery story. The depth of analysis kept me flagging pages and rereading passages. I love the feminist spirit our hero embodies.I did find it interesting that although skin, hair, and attitude were discussed freely, African immigrants never even made it into the discussion, let alone into the exclusive resort.The social message somewhat dominates the plot, but the mystery is also a fun read. Highly recommended for those willing to confront todays issues.As for me, I loved the blend of story and message. Because really, until the United States deals with the escalating issue of racial inequality, particularly regarding African-Americans I cant breathe.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,February 18, 2015,B00P6NDETK,Blanche Among the Talented Tenth (Blanche White series Book 2),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P6NDETK,Brash Books,$4.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Subtle, Savagely Funny; a Must-Read,All Evelyn has ever wanted is to please her mother; all Barbara, Evelyns mother, has ever wanted is for Evelyn to be accepted into elite Eastern society. Barbara doesnt care whether Evelyn is well read, but she had sure as hell better know which spoon to use, and what to wear to every occasion and most of all, she had better know everybody whos anybody. In other words, Cliffords skewer of high society hits the mark in ways both wry and hilarious. This terribly amusing little tale goes on sale August 18oh wait, was my rhyme a trifle tacky? Anyway, you can buy it soon, or you can order it in advance, but I was lucky and got a copy free from Net Galley and St. Martins Press for this humble review. Thank you to both of them.Evelyns parents want different things, and its just her luckshe is their only child, so all their expectations fall on her shoulders. Her father, an attorney with egalitarian notions and a folksy Southern manner, is often out of town, working for the clients he represents and sticking it to the big pharmaceutical companies. So most of the time, its Evelyn and her mother. And her mother is relentless in her need for social stature.Evelyn is sent to Sheffield Boarding School, which should provide some relief, but her mother obtains a copy of the student directory, and has tracked the social value of every child there. Evelyn is friends with Charlotte, a young woman of high ideals and great loyalty, but she has pigtails, a social no-no, and the wrong damn family. Evelyn is conflicted, because she is close to Charlotte, but her mother wants her to drop her. Her mother has chosen the people Evelyn should cultivate. Imagine!Over the course of time, Evelyn manages to worm her way into the upper reaches of the social echelon, but she cant financially afford the lifestyle she is expected to lead. And worst of all, she comes to realize, once she is rubbing elbows with the cream of society, that her mother is actually pretty embarrassing. Her mother does not have as much upper-crust social sense as she thinks she does.Shed better avoid her.You may think I have spoiled the surprises, but you havent heard the half of it. There are so many choice bits along the way, and then the ending is something else entirely. At times I felt that I was watching a train wreck I was incapable of stopping, but the thing is, I really liked watching it, and the ending, which seems obvious as it approaches, is a surprise after all.If youre heading for the beach this August, or just need entertainment for a good long holiday weekend with the air conditioner cranked and a nice drink ready to hand, this is a gift you should get for yourself. Its absorbing and vastly entertaining.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,August 19, 2015,1250077176,Everybody Rise: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250077176,St. Martin's Press,$14.84
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Impeccable Research Brings Napoleon's Ideas Into One Serious Work,What an ambitious project! This tome is not the kind of thing any writer puts together for money. Its a labor of painstaking love and pride. Years were spent assembling Napoleons military ideas. Thank you once and thank you twice, to Oxford University Press and Net Galley for allowing me to preview the DRC. And of course, thank you to Mr. Colson for his effort. You can buy it this month.The difficulty in publishing Napoleons ideas is that they were scattered. The man was not only a military genius but also an academic one, and every time he turned around he was having someone take something down. Assembling them into one place was another matter, particularly since he was captured, exiled, captured again, exiled again. In a fit of despondency he tossed the memoir he had begun into the flames at one point. So gathering everything together and then sorting the philosophical, which still has relevancy, from the technological part of Napoleons military work that is now outdated by more sophisticated weaponry, is another massive task. Its no small wonder it took someone a long time to do the job and do it right. The reader will perhaps be surprised to learn how many quotations have been ascribed to Napoleon that he actually never said.That said, I also have to acknowledge that the niche audience here is academic. This is nobodys breezy popular biography. And whereas I could happily never see some media jerk throw together something and pretend its accurate based upon his own personal fame, at the same time, I just need to warn the reader that this is going to be tough going. Im persistent; I love history. I was willing to wade through Neil Sheehans Pentagon Papers, and I was willing to fight my way through this book too. But for most readers, either a purpose, such as perhaps upper level or graduate level university course work or a thesis, or a really intense interest in French history and military strategy will be required to get through it.Colsons scholarship and research are beyond reproach. Read the introduction and youll get the point. He has done his homework many times over. In fact, unless one is a fluent reader of French, it would be impossible to duplicate his effort even if one were inclined to try. But why do that, when you can access this excellently researched and painstakingly organized volume?Highly recommended for the serious scholar.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,May 12, 2015,B00U09W93C,Napoleon: On War,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U09W93C,OUP Oxford,$17.04

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Period Piece Tells US Role in Saigon 1967,Vietnam , an impassioned journalistic effort by Mary McCarthy originally published during the US war against Vietnamese freedom fighters, is a once-stirring piece of research that, while worthwhile as a period piece or for specific types of historical research, is in general terms too dated to be of great interest to most readers. Instead, it speaks to the innocence and disbelief Americans with no axe to grind in Southeast Asia felt when they came to grip with the actual facts regarding the war, and how many responded after becoming enlightened.Thank you once and twice, first to Open Road Integrated Media, and next to Net Galley, for allowing me to read the DRC in exchange for this honest review. The book is now available for purchase.In many ways, the American mindset can be divided into two contemporary periods: one before the Vietnam War, and one after it. Before the war against working people in Vietnam commenced, Americans by and large trusted their government and believed what its political leaders said was true. As layer upon layer of lies was peeled away from the startling nugget of truth at the core of this conflict, many peoplein particular, the youth of the USA and around the worldwere outraged at the many ways in which they had been deceived. Most of those smooth-faced but indignant youth are now grandparents now, and most have learned never to believe something is true just because a politicianeven the president of the USAsays so.McCarthy wrote this book during the metamorphosis of the American public from the former condition to the latter.McCarthy went to Vietnam as a member of the press, and was astonished by both what she saw, and by the things that were told her. In 1967, when this book was written, the military leaders she interviewed told her that roughly ten percent of the population, or 1.5 million people, had become refugees, casualties of war, because the bombing had destroyed their homes and defoliated large swaths of jungle. It was unclear to me whether they were speaking about all of Vietnam or only South Vietnam; her time there seems to have been spent entirely, or mostly, inside the city of Saigon, which had become so Americanized that there were more English-speaking Caucasians there than Vietnamese.At times, her outrage is sufficiently scathing to take this reviewer back to that time. I was just a kid, but the white-hot rage in the streets is hard to forget, even so.In describing her visit to Saigon, she speaks about the ways in which officers and GIs alike regarded a hospitalized child, a victim of the bombing: because they showered her with candy, dollar bills, had photographs of themselves taken with her, and brought her toys, they considered her to be a very lucky tyke indeed. They made reference to her owning more dolls than Macys, and one soldier said fondly, That girl is so spoiled.This type of rationalization, the notion that after wounding and possibly orphaning a child with bombs that destroyed her village and left her full of shrapnel, she had become so spoiled, is characterized by McCarthy as Pharisee virtue, a phrase I found startlingly eloquent.There are other moments when she appears a bit confused, and appears to be unconsciously using the terminology of the very military and government forces that she opposes. My own youngest child is half Asian, and when I read an expository sentence in which McCarthy referred to the local children as slant-eyed, I almost dropped my reader. What the hell? She refers to the Vietnamese policeman that works for the US army as a small Vietnamese policeman, and from context, I got the distinct impression that he was not noticeably smaller than other Vietnamese men, and that in fact his size had nothing to do with anything. If she were still alive today, I would advise the author to check her terminology, and then check her own assumptions about what normal looks like. It appears she was carrying around some ingrained racism that came out despite her finest intentions.One more strange factor here was her reference to the uniforms worn by the National Liberation Front, (otherwise referred to pejoratively as the Viet Cong, a term she uses freely), as black pajamas. Did McCarthy not understand that this was an expression used by the US military which was intended to demean Vietnamese fighters by suggesting they did not know how to design a uniform? Vietnam is a very warm place, and its humid as hell, which is why they used lightweight cloth to make uniforms. The jungles were dark and virtually impenetrable, and this is why black was a really good choice of uniform color. Pajamas are something one sleeps in. The Vietnamese soldier didnt get a lot of sleep, and he did not fight wearing sleeping apparel.McCarthy is not always blind regarding the power of terminology however: she points up the fact that napalm, which had been made even more horrific in that it now adhered to things (and flesh) while burning, had been name-changed to Incinderjell, making it sound like a childrens dessert. Officials could publicly state that napalm was no longer in use, because now it was called something different. Likewise, defoliants were referred to as weed killer.The only photographs are of the author.For those that want to travel back to the time when Johnson was president and Americas youth were waking up to the fact that the US government did not always behave in accordance with its stated democratic ideals, this is a good work to drop into your reader. Its very brief, and you can finish it in a weekend.I also recommend this work to students and other researchers looking at this volatile and transformational period in American history. Since she personally went to Saigon while the war was being fought, her own experiences constitute a primary document, and in such a case, I would not rate this book a 3 star work, but rather 4 stars.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,October 15, 2015,B00FEZ25CW,Vietnam,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEZ25CW,Open Road Media,$9.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Perfect for Family Barbecue; Looks Good, Washes Up Well,This is nothing fancy, but exactly what I wanted for a barbecue on my own back deck with my own family. Our outdoor table is metal, so I always toss a cloth on it before serving food. The cloth looks just like it does in the picture. It repels moisture for a brief time, so if you slop something liquid on it, you have the chance to blot it up before it soaks in and makes a mess of the cloth. I washed it, pulled it out after it had sat in the dryer for a few minutes, so not immediately as I would with my husband's work shirts and pants, but fairly soon, and there were no wrinkles.So if you are having a big-deal occasion and want fine linen, I guess you will have to go find fine linen tablecloths and then find someone to iron them, unless that's your idea of a fun summer activity.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Exactly Right for Me; Fits Smaller Adult Heads,I hate the heat. I hate the sun. Blame my pale ancestors! Once I resolved to do the neighborhood yard sale, just this one time, I decided I needed more coverage for my head and neck than a ball cap would provide. Once many years ago I bought a nice straw hat that would not stay on my head, and so the little strings with the fastener on this hat drew my attention.It worked! It worked! I was out there with a blazing hot sky (by Seattle standards; upper 80's) from 7:45 AM till 3 PM. I put on sunscreen before heading out; mid-morning; and again a little after noon. I got only a very slight burn on my face. My scalp and neck area, both in front and back, are where my worst sunburns tend to occur. The hat and screen together shielded me from that terrible fate. My arms got really burnt in spite of all the sunscreen, but that just shows me what would have happened to my scalp, face, neck and shoulders if I had not had this hat. The adjustable tie at the bottom was very comfortable, and I didn't even notice it while it was on. My head is smaller than average and this was an exact fit, so if your head is average or large, it may not work for you.The summer is still ahead of us, and I will continue to use this hat when barbecuing or working in the yard.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Comprehensive Yet Readable Biography from Renowned Schlar,Although this book is published by Yale, Klehvniuk is a research fellow at the Russian national archives, and has devoted twenty years of his life to studying Stalin, the ruler that held much of Eastern Europe in an iron grasp from 1929-1953, when he died. That must be a really dark place, but hes done a brilliant job. Many thanks go to Net Galley and Yale University Press for allowing me a free peek. This book is available for purchase right now.The author tells us that revisionists have undertaken to rehabilitate Stalins reputation lately, and to attribute his various unspeakable crimes against humanity to those below him. What a thought! Many previously secret archives were opened in the early 1990s, and our researcher has been busy indeed.He begins with a brief but well done recounting of Stalins childhood, which he says was grim, but not grimmer than that of most of his peers, and surely not sufficiently grim to account for the monster he would become later in life. Then he discusses the Russian Revolution, and the relationship and struggle among its leadership, most notably Lenin (of whom he has a less favorable view than my own), Trotsky, and Stalin. Lenin and Trotsky disagreed over a number of things, primarily the role of the peasantry in the new society and its government. Lenin pushed Stalin to a higher level of leadership for a brief while because he was not happy with Trotsky, who in any case was in charge of the military, a critical task all by itself at the time. However, when Lenins health began to fail and he realized he would have to select a successor, he turned to Trotsky. By then, unfortunately, Stalin had built himself a clique within the leadership. A struggle for control ensued. Stalin came out on top, and Trotsky was banished. In 1940, Stalin paid a henchman to go to Mexico City and kill him with an ice pick.After Lenins death, government was largely by committee, and although ruthless decisions sometimes had to be made at a time when there were still Mensheviks (Social Democrats) who would turn the revolutionary achievement into a bourgeois state, no one person had the ultimate power over the lives of his comrades. Over the next few years, however, the German Revolution failed and scarce resources had to be allocated. Stalin consolidated his hold on authority and the precious resources that could not be distributed sufficiently to keep everyone under the Soviet umbrella warm and fed went first (and increasingly lavishly) to the corrupt bureaucratic caste that controlled the Soviet Union, foremost Stalin himself. After that came resources for the workers in Russian cities; and after that came everyone else. The peasantry, which had been in a state close to slavery under the Tsar, were still shut off from the benefits of the Revolution, and Stalin undertook to force them to produce food for the city while punishing and often executing those that tried to stockpile a small amount on which to sustain their own families.Klehvniuk gives a good deal of space, and rightly so, to the Great Terror of 1937-1938, when Stalin began suspecting all sorts of people, those close to him, far away, sometimes in large groups, of conspiring against him. He had them rounded up and executed. There even came a point in his career when he was having family members rounded up and shot. Toward the end of his life it was hard to find a qualified physician to treat him, because Stalin had been having so many doctors arrested and shot.Klehvniuk provides us with a surprisingly readable narrative. He tells the chronological story of Stalins rule, with the horrifying numbers of people, most of them innocent, that were slain for political and nonpolitical crimes during the quarter century of his rule, and he alternates it with a narrative of Stalin on his deathbed. (Because everyone was so afraid of the guy, when they found him on the floor, alive but in a humiliating position, they had to step out and take a meeting so that no one individual would bear that responsibility. Until then, he stayed on the floor right where he was.)An intriguing question that will probably never be answered has to do with the very congested state of his arteries upon autopsy. How much of his behavior can be associated with physical causes, possibly including dementia? He was one mean old man when he died. Its a haunting consideration.This reviewer was already familiar with a lot of the basic facts of Russian history, and moreso with the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin, and Trotsky. Nevertheless I think that the interested lay reader, if not overly attached to remembering the names of all of the secondary players that came and went, ought to be able to make it through this work and find it as absorbing as I did. Its dark material, and I read other things in between sessions in order to keep my own mood from sliding. That said, I dont think you will find a more knowledgeable writer or a more approachable biography anywhere than this one.Whether for your own academic purposes or simply out of interest and the joy in reading a strong biography, you really arent likely to find a better written biography of Stalin nor a more well informed author. It went on sale May 19, so you can get a copy now.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Brilliant Advocacy for Prison Education Programs,Jan Walker has spent a large part of her life developing and implementing educational programs, primarily parenting programs, for inmates, and the textbook she has written for these classes is used in prisons around the USA. This book is her account of her work with prisoners of both genders in Washington State. Most of her material addresses her work with serious offenders housed on McNeil Island, a place with a notorious reputation locally because it houses sex offenders. Thank you, Net Galley and Picata Press for allowing me to access the DRC. This book is hot off the presses, and you should read it.The primary purpose of Walkers memoir is to let us know that 95% of those currently incarcerated will be released to their families at some point in their lives. A small percentage have their parental rights terminated, and a small percentage are in prisonreally and trulyfor their whole lives. Almost everybody gets out, and almost everyone goes back to their family. Wasnt it Robert Frost who wrote that Home is the place that when you get there, they have to take you in? And so it is with former inmates. Theyre going back to those kids. Its in everyones best interest that they know how to talk to them and how to treat them when they return, as well as while they are incarcerated. She points time and againand there is so much information and so many anecdotes in between, that its a good idea to bring her point back to usto the fact that most domestic abusers were themselves abused as kids. The only way to break the cycle is to teach inmates how to take responsibility for what they have done; and how to let their children know that they have made a mistake; that prison is the consequence; and that it is not the childs fault.Some of this may seem obvious to you, reader, but the woman knows a tremendous amount. And as a former educator in a low income middle school, I can personally attest to the way that children internalize the things that happen to them. Some of them regard themselves as responsible for their parents divorces; Ive had those kids in my classrooms. And when my first husband died in a manner both sudden and tragic, our children didnt just think it was their faults; they knew it. They were absolutely sure. It took years of therapy to pull them out of that dark place.Inmates are frequently semi-literate, and literacy skills are crucial to the ability to think critically. So the community college classes that seem like an absurd perk for inmates to receive free of charge, the tab paid by the tax-paying public, are actually beneficial, not only to the inmates and the children that we hope will not repeat their mistakes; they also benefit society in the long run. Better readers are better thinkers; better thinkers make better choices, and theyre better parents in most cases.Walker has seen and heard plenty of the ugly underbelly of serious offenders lives, attitudes, and habits. There was more than one moment when she questioned her personal safety when the prison was short-staffed and she was alone with her classes, no one to help even within range of a good holler. She chose not to wear the gear that guards have because she wanted to differentiate her own role in her students minds. The gamble paid off more often than not. But she knew there were some mean, tremendously hard people there. This isnt about that.So dont think she is some bleeding-heart enabler, because she is far from it. We know that she has seen plenty of ugly more from the way she avoids telling us the most shocking material, rather than because she flings it at us (which she doesnt). But the anecdotes she chooses to sharewith names changed for the purpose of privacy, of courseunderscore her talking points, and the work is also painstakingly documented. Do you read the sources and end notes in nonfiction? I do. That part of the book says a lot about whether a writer is just referencing other writers, writing up their own opinions, or speaking as an expert. Walker is an expert.The book starts out dry. Fight your way through that initial fifteen percent; by the time you hit the twenty percent mark, you will be really glad you stuck to it. Although I recommend this outstanding work to everyone, I recommend it especially to public school teachers, particularly those that teach at high poverty schools with large numbers of children of color. I did that for twenty years, and I have seen how deeply affecting it is for children and adolescents to have a parent in prison. Some are ashamed; a lot of them are angry or confused. Some go for a visit that involves a stiff weekend commute, sleeping in the car, and then they fall asleep at their desks on Monday. But the ones that suffer most are those that were promised a visit they didnt get; that were expecting their parent to be released, and then the parent wasnt; and those that are convinced their parent is innocent.And here, though you may roll your eyes, I have to address the one little nugget that ricochets inside my brain when Walker discusses teaching inmates to own what they did and tell their children that they made a mistake; prison is their consequence, its not your fault. I understand the rationale, because probably 99.9% of those incarcerated (primarily on McNeil Island, which is near Tacoma, Washington, about an hour from my Seattle home) are not only guilty of what they are in prison for having done, but more offenses for which they werent caught. Its also true that there are no millionaires on death row, and anyone that has read Michelle Alexanders study of the racial disparity in The New Jim Crow, or who has followed the data produced by the NAACP and other organizations centered on BlackLivesMatter, knows that Caucasians serve hard time far less often than people of color that commit the same crimes. But that does not mean that those that are there didnt do the crime; they did .most of them.At the same time, my mind kept going back to exceptional peoplenone of them on McNeilthat I am convinced are innocent. Should Leonard Peltier tell his children that he made a mistake, when he was framed? What about Mumia Abu Jamal? What about the lesser-known Mark Curtis, whose rape case was so clearly bogus that the local chapter of NOW endorsed his case? I know that in the last case, parole was denied over, and over, and over again because he refused to sit down and be rehabilitated for a crime he did not, did not, did not commit and would rot in prison for his entire life before he would crumble and confess to a lie just to get out of that place. Hes out now, but he sat through his whole sentence because he could not have parole by maintaining his innocence.So although these cases are exceptions rather than rules, and I actually think Walkers program is both strong and essential, its worth bearing in mind that once in awhile, someone that says they didnt do it, really didnt do it.I have so many outstanding passages I flagged, so many poignant anecdotes, so much compelling evidence. I finished reading this book a week ago, but it is the really excellent ones like this that I have to mull over for awhile before I can write the review. I had 187 notes, and it was impossible to select some over others. I went back and reread them, and apart from a few paraphrased instances mentioned above, I think youll do better to read them in context, the way she wrote them.The heartbreaking thing is that now that her classes and text have been adopted around the nation, they have been canceled at McNeil. Some wise ass somewhere decided that volunteers could be found to do this work. Sure, maybe once. Really sturdy do-gooders might last six months, even. But the work has to be done consistently, and you cant fire a volunteer who phones in sick all the time, or just doesnt show up, and those that are incarcerated need to develop a relationship with a single reliable professional instructor. I hope the Washington State legislature will reconsider this critical, valuable part of rehabilitation in our prisons. If we cant raze those prisons to the ground, as the old folk song suggests, then let us at least make a difference for the children of those that are in them.Highly recommended for all educators, for Civil Rights activists, and for anyone concerned about social justice. Actually, I recommend it to everyone.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Epic and Enduring,Robert Andrews has created an historical masterpiece in this massive tome, a biography of Napoleon. Thank you and thank you again to Net Galley and Viking Adult Publishers for the ARC.Andrews is well known among historians; his scholarship and experience firmly establish him as an expert in the field of European history, especially military history and biography. The recent availability of a vast treasure-trove of primary documents made this biography possible, together with a tremendous amount of work and travel. He visited and battle sites where Napoleon had been before him, before all of us. (And he set off the alarm in Napoleons throne three times!)How long did this take, I wonder? By the time it was published, Andrews must have felt an overwhelming sense both of loss and of satisfaction.As for your humble reviewer, I came to read about Napoleon, whose military career, rule, and downfall I had studied only at the shallowest level during my undergraduate years a whole long time ago, through the back door. My field is the American Civil War, but I was intrigued by the number of Civil War heroes (and others) who had studied Napoleons methods in detail, and referred to them when creating their own battle plans. What was it about Napoleon?Generally, my advice to those contemplating reading a lengthy biography is to get the basics down first, but I didnt follow my own advice here. I had the opportunity to get the ARC at the end of November, and it was now or never. I decided to plunge in, poorly prepared though I might be. When I was finished, I found I had bookmarked or made notes in over 700 places in this 926 page work. So whereas I wont use all of my references, I can truthfully say that there is no filler, no fat. If you havent the patience for almost a thousand pages of Napoleon, then dont go there, but for heavens sake dont pretend that more is included here than is necessary for a thorough, scholarly, yet interesting treatment.Having said that much, I also have to confess that I struggled somewhat with the ARC. My knowledge of European geography is pretty basic. I know where most of the countries are, what their climates are like, and for the most part, where the borders are located. When we morph into the Napoleonic era, I really, really needed maps, and thats the price one sometimes pays for an ARC: your map is [map insert] noted. There will be a map; I dont get to see it. So I gamely brought myself to my desktop for the first four Coalition Wars, and was lucky enough to find an interactive map that gave me part of what I needed to know. In some places, Andrews explained what took place so well that I could see most of the battle inside my head. But as of the fifth coalition forward, I quit trying to find my own maps when I couldnt follow the action, and just read what was in the book.All told, Andrews corrected some misperceptions I had developed regarding Napoleon. My own view had been that there was a heroic French Revolution, followed by what are usually termed excesses by the Jacobins who began the Revolution. (Today these en masse trips to the guillotine would be called atrocities.) But could the whole thing be salvaged? It seemed such a terrible waste to have a popular revolution, throw out not only a monarchy but one unusually lacking in decency toward the peasants and urban poor of France, and then have it all come tumbling down. And it also seems like a waste to have an autocrat take over. This was my perspective before reading Andrewss biography.Though his approach is both scholarly and balanced, Andrews offers a positive portrait of Napoleon, whom he treats with a fond, almost affectionate narrative. He points out that Napoleon kept the Bourbons off the throne for over twenty years, and its true that they returned in 1815 after Napoleons first abdication. Things got really ugly then. And he also points out that Napoleons career was unusually complicated. The point is well taken.For example, who invades neighboring nations, overthrows their leaders, presumes to rewrite their constitution without consulting anyone that lives there yet bestows upon them more civil rights than they have ever had before? And who else would insist in his terms for peace not only remuneration so that he can pay his troops and the annual benefits of military widows, but also demands that great works of art, privately owned, be turned over to him whereupon he places them in a gallery where all visitors can enjoy them?Mind you, the man is no Robin Hood. Far from it! He makes it clear from the beginning that he has no use for the hoi polloi, and whenever he ceases privately held property, he also sees to it that the previous owner is compensated.The word hubris is often applied to Napoleon, and if not him, then who? Andrews argues that he might have been successful if only. And theres the rub, right? Because initially, he and his troops travel fast and hard. In the beginning, he asks nothing of them that he would not do himself. His opponents, on the other hand, are spoiled and effete. They travel with vast amounts of personal baggage and servants. They cant move until they personally have this, that, the other. And in the end, that is the guy that Napoleon becomes.The text is made more lively throughout with quotations of Napoleon himself, a prolific writer and a brilliant, articulate speaker.The chapters are organized according to place, generally speaking, and this is very useful when the reader needs to go back and fact-check.Andrews argues that Napoleons autocracy-as-meritocracy might have been successful if he had applied the standard to all of the dynasties he created after toppling their rulers that he applied to France. Nepotism created endless problems, and though Napoleon somehow thought that he personally might make up for the failings of his relatives, there is only so much one man can do. The many, many worthless siblings and other relatives he installed as instant royalty drained his resources and made problems that didnt have to happen. His first wife, Josephine, was such an obsessive spender that one hates to think of the number of children under age six who might have lived had the wealth been more widely distributed.Napoleons most loyal base of support was within the military, but he fought so aggressively that too many soldiers died, and the backlash was bound to come sooner or later. Yet the military base he so depended upon wanted him back again after just ten months of Bourbon reign.Could Napoleon have been successful if he had left the Iberian peninsula alone? If he had avoided attacking Russia? Napoleon himself, upon looking back while in exile during his last years, recognizes that trying to best Britain, with its unstoppable navy, was folly; yet he certainly kept them busy for a good long while.At one point, he reflects that if he had known he would end up defeated, he could have made different choices. He would like to be allowed to emigrate to the United States; who knows, he could have founded a state there! And here, my jaw drops as I imagine that instead of selling the Louisiana Purchase (which doubled the size of the USA) to the USA via President Thomas Jefferson, he had decided to settle it. But being Napoleon, would it have even stopped there, I wonder? He hated Britain and had nothing against US rulers; maybe he would have been able to kick the British out of Canada instead of fruitlessly attempting to rout them from their homeland.Suddenly I can see how Andrews has become spellbound by what might have been. He has spent a lot more time with this material than I have, and its starting to affect me, too!I know that some of those who read my reviews are teachers. I dont see this as high school material; a small portion of it could be selected for honors level seniors or community college students perhaps, but then you have huge books to buy in order to use just a portion. I dont see even the most gifted teenager sticking it out from start to finish. Though the narrative is engaging, the definitive biography is epic .It requires patience and dedication on the part of its readers. Developmentally, most young folks in their late teens and early twenties just wont be there yet.But if you are in doubt, buy one copy and read it yourself, then pass it around a little bit and see how it goes. Likewise, if you are homeschooling a truly extraordinary teenager that you think would gobble this up, buy it, read it (because you cant home school anyone using a text you have not personally read), and then if you still think it may work and your student is game, give it a try.All told, the price you will pay for this remarkable single volume biography is nothing compared to its worth in your own library, even if only used as a reference source.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,January 7, 2015,0670025321,Napoleon: A Life,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670025321,Viking,$24.75
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Bragg Thriller Builds Suspense; Great Entertainment,Peter Bragg is a San Francisco private eye. He is originally from Seattle, but he left all that behind: the rain, the grey skies, the depression and Lorna, his ex-wife. Now a case brings him back. He isnt eager to make the trip, but an old friend is in a spot and needs his help. And for the reader, it is a trip indeed, since the story is set in the 1980s, when it was originally published. This established mystery series is now available digitally, and I was lucky enough to jump on Net Galleys offer to read it free. My thanks go to them, and to Brash Books, for the DRC. What a fun romp!These are modern times alrighty. Theres a new Interstate connection to Bellingham; a guy can hop on the I-5 and be there in two hours. Neat!Those that have been to Seattle lately understand how wry this is, since a person can sit that long in gridlock just trying to get to the outermost suburbs now, at least during rush hour.In addition to a trip back in time, Lynch serves up all sorts of twists and turns that keep the plot moving nicely, but also keep the game fair for the reader.When all was said and done, I found myself wishing I could read the whole series. Recommended to anyone that enjoys good detective fiction. You can get it for yourself May 5, 2015.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Narrow but Well Constructed; Great for Small Guest Room,This is a fine mirror to hang up for those that just want to fix their hair or makeup on the way out the door. Check the dimensions--it is much narrower than most mirrors of its length. Because I am putting it in a small guest bedroom, and because I was buying all new furniture and really needed to keep the costs down, I went ahead and bought it anyway. It hangs over a small dresser, and will be sufficient to keep its user from hogging the bathroom when it's time to preen. It is well constructed and surprisingly heavy. There is a hanger on back, so all you need is a nail in the wall (on a stud or with a toggle bolt) to hang it up. It is too heavy to put on a hollow closet door.One thing I did not note from the description is that it is a distressed style of paint. We can wear out the paint on our furniture ourselves, thanks. However, given the hike in price for a mirror that is wider or not distressed paint, I decided this was the better value, and I am glad I bought it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 13, 2015,B008YQ4SDM,Gifts & Decor Elegant White Hanging Accent Bed Room Hall Wall Mirror,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008YQ4SDM,Furniture Creations,$24.31
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Excellent Narrative Holds True Today,This newly released digital version of Garrows outstanding, comprehensive recounting and analysis of the famous Selma demonstrations carried out by Martin Luther King Junior, other civil rights leaders, along with masses of African-American civil rights activists could not be more timely. In 2013, the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 after a lot of effort and sacrifice was gutted. The US criminal justice system has drawn the eyes of the world, and they arent friendly eyes. Thank you, and thank you once more to Net Galley and Open Road Media for making the DRC available for me to read, and for publishing this excellent book digitally for you to access also.Please be aware that this is not a popular biography of the struggle, but a scholarly one, and will be most appreciated by those who, like your reviewer, have a strong interest in the topic, or who are doing research. In that spirit, I encourage those who also read it to access the endnotes. Garrow has some really interesting remarks, and his references and cross-references will make any researcher bow in awe.Many people dont know that Dr. King entered the struggle as a civil rights novice, newly out of graduate school and just 26 years old. (Open Road has also just released the digital version of Garrows Pulitzer-winning biography, which I have also reviewed.) Initially his hope was to shame segregationists into integrating schools and providing equal services to Black Southerners. The failure of the movement to make any in-roads in Albany, Georgia convinced King and other leaders that this method would not work. Instead, the eyes of the nation must be made to witness the injustices being meted out in Dixie. For the media, both print and television, a relatively recent mass media source, to pick up events there, they needed to demonstrate in a nonviolent fashion, not back down, and do so in a place where a nasty, violent response on the part of Caucasian cops could be counted upon. In other words, no change could take place without confronting Black Americas worst nightmares head on and intentionally.Birmingham was the first place this was attempted. Bull Connor was known for gratuitous violence, and the footage of some really ugly aggression, especially the widely-circulated photo of the cop holding an unarmed demonstrator in place while siccing a huge German Shepherd on him, prodded the consciences of Caucasian viewers in the North. (Many Northerners of color were already funding the movement; musician Harry Mancini was one important fundraiser.)But the attempt of Birmingham demonstrators to effect change was limited. Although it drew international attention, the Kennedy administration seemed more intent on finding ways to shut King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference down than they were on creating adherence to Federal laws that gave Black folks equality.Garrow reminds us (or informs us, depending on the readers age) that in the late 1960s, one in three white Americans polled said they would not want to sit next to a Black person on a train or bus, and similar figures also showed that they didnt want African-Americans living near them, at their kids schools, or even trying on the same outfits in department stores that they themselves might later try on.Young people that are tired of hearing the Dream speech and watching Eyes on the Prize footage (for which Garrow also receives a portion of the credit) dont seem to understand exactly how brave these people were. My own father told me, when I asked about the footage on television, that the policemen on the evening news were just doing their jobs. He shook with rage as he pointed at the screen and told me, These people are breaking the law! I was six years old at the time.So some people up North needed to either change their minds, or be so repelled by the violence being done to innocent people who obviously wanted something reasonable that they would insist that the right thing be done. And although the movement never did change my father, it changed the thinking of a lot of people.Birmingham failed to do the job for two reasons, says Garrow . First, they were not able to maintain a completely nonviolent atmosphere on the part of the Black participants. While demonstrators were nonviolent, thousands of African-Americans, some of whom dared not demonstrate actively lest they lose their jobs, became enraged at the maltreatment of the demonstrators; some threw pieces of bricks, concrete, and bottles at the cops from the sidelines.When I think about this, it doesnt seem like an even contest to me. Swarms of cops in riot gear; huge attack dogs; fire hoses; lethal weaponry of just about everything except tanks and missiles were accessed by the cops. And a few locals pitched a few bottles. Big damn deal.But media loves to try to portray both sides of an issue, however uneven they may be. When one brick is thrown, the demonstration will magically turn into a riot on the news the next day.The methods of the Civil Rights movement would become valuable lessons for those that led the movement against the Vietnam War. The SCLC, SNCC, CORE, and other organizations that led this movement had to invent most of it, or at least Americanize it; many of the basic tenets were borrowed from Gandhi when he led the movement to kick Britain out of India.So, there were a few folks that were not strictly nonviolent in Birmingham; the other problem, says Garrow, is that there was no one, clear goal in Birmingham. So much was so wrong that they went in with a laundry list. When it got into the news, it seemed muddy. Those who loved justice could see what was wrong; but every struggle needs a single, clear demand in order to start those waters of justice rolling. In Birmingham, it wasnt plain what they were there to do.Selma was the tipping point. All those lessons came into play. The single goal, one that the Democratic administration had pledged (privately of course) to support, was for Black folks to be able to walk into the courthouse and register to vote. No literacy tests; no poll fees; no alley entrance for people of color. Just walk through the front door; register; and vote.This time discipline was perfect; the marchers were absolutely, completely nonviolent. Sheriff Clark, the mad dog that the movement sought to bring out of his ugly hole snarling and swinging, did not disappoint. People were sent to the hospital, and a Caucasian clergyman who answered Dr. Kings call to come support the Civil Rights of Southern Blacks was killed by the cops. This time it was clear what the goal was, clear who was wrong and who was right. And the telegrams (an ancient technology since replaced by e-mail) rolled into the Capitol.Black intelligentsia and working class, I; crazy Southern Bubbas, 0.President Lyndon Johnson was crafty, a politician who knew what side his bread was buttered on. At first he too sought to shut the whole thing down, get people out of the streets and home to their own hearths. But when events unfolded and it became clear that a sea change was occurring, he got on television and gave the best damn speech possibly since the days of Lincoln. Garrow reprints the entire masterpiece. It was viewed by seventy million Americans.If you are still with meand my five star reviews are almost never briefthen you may also have sufficient interest to read Garrows history of the movement and particularly of Selma, Alabama and the crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. His research is impeccable, his organization easy to follow (or to access a portion of, for those doing research of their own), and his narrative is really compelling.Once you are done, I hope you will give some time and attention to the new Civil Rights Movement unfolding before us right now. Its everyones job to be sure everyone can vote. And until African-American men and teenagers can drive, walk, and work without harassment or violence from cops and vigilantes, I really can't breathe.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,March 30, 2015,B00TL64GZE,Protest at Selma: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Voting Rights Act of 1965,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TL64GZE,Open Road Media,$9.99

It's always a challenge to try to find one he can't destroy.It's only been a month, so we won't know for a little while whether Samsonite can break the record, but this pack has sturdy-looking zippers, good strong seams, and he likes the amount of padding in the arms for carrying. His laptop fits in there and he still has enough room for a lightweight jacket or other items.I got a great deal on this pack from amazon, and the young man in question really likes it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,January 10, 2015,B007B5POVC,Samsonite Xenon 2 Backpack PFT Case Black,Clothing,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B5POVC,Samsonite,$49.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Would Buy It Again,This was less expensive than the big plastic laundry hampers, and it collapses so that it doesn't take up as much space when not in use. We are city folk, and our washer and dryer are in a bathroom, so space is at a premium.If you fill it all the way up, you will need to carry it from the bottom like a heavy bag of groceries. You'd be surprised how much clothes or linens weighs in large quantity. I fill it up about halfway and carry it from the handle.Also, I am disabled and use a stair lift. I can't carry a big tub of laundry on that, but I can carry this.It's a little flimsy and the velcro clasps that close it shut when not in use are really, really stiff, but I got my money's worth,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,February 26, 2015,B002KCOGX8,Whitmor  6155-699  18 Inch Collapsible Hamper, White With Blue Trim,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KCOGX8,Whitmor,$13.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Perfect for Gentle, Limited Use; Light Weight Great for Disabled and Elderly,This is a good buy if you know what you're getting into and have a particular purpose in mind. It isn't going to be a good substitute for a regular garden hose unless you live in a condo or downstairs apartment and are just watering a small flower bed or pots by hand. The good part is the very light weight, especially if you are disabled, arthritic, or both. The bad news is that it has to be babied along, and won't take the kind of treatment a heavy rubber garden hose will.I have a small yard inside the city. Most of my yard is reachable by soaker hoses, but I have potted plants on my front porch and a small bed nearby that aren't reached by my soaker hoses. Every day in summer I step out, turn on my little 50 foot hose (mine is royal blue), and I water my pots and the little pansies and petunias beside my porch. When I am done, I turn off the hose, hold about half of it upside down to drain it, and then I coil it carefully on top of a plastic crate on the porch (and out of the sun), where it waits for me to do the same thing the next day. Lather, rinse, repeat, right?I really like the fact that it is so lightweight. The only thing I feel is causing any weight at all on my sore joints is the water inside the hose, and that goes with the territory. We have had temperatures close to 100 degrees, unseasonably hot, and the hose has been fine.So the bottom line is to follow the rules:* drain it every single time* don't leave it where it can be stepped on by someone* don't drag it across anything prickly like rose bushes with thorns, or pine needles*don't put it on a hose hangerIf all of those are too limited for your purposes, this is not the product you want.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,First Class Guide to Gettsyburg, Plast and Present,Hallowed Ground packs a great deal of information regarding Gettysburg, past and present, into a tight package. I own an earlier edition, and I used the photographs in it as part of my lectures when I was teaching a unit on the Civil War.McPherson is a renowned author, winner of the Pulitzer for Battle Cry of Freedom. That volume should be the go-to book for anyone looking for a first highly literate glimpse of the American Civil War. This book is only about Gettysburg, as it is today and as it was then. McPherson has not only walked every square inch of the area involved, but also takes his students on tour there. He tells the reader what parts of the standard park guide tour script are actually incorrect, which is particularly useful for those visiting the park. In fact, this guide is primarily targeted for those planning to walk the large area encompassed, but I havent been there, and most likely wont, and I never regretted the purchase of that earlier edition. If I were teaching still, or mobile enough to be able to do that tour, Id buy this one as well.I am delighted to be able to review the DRC for the newer edition, which contains even more digital photographs. I couldnt see a lot of themgot a blank, gray box instead, which happens with galleys sometimesbut the quality of what I could see was excellent. Put this together with a lot of other primary sources, including battle plans, letters written by those involved at the time, and photographs that were already in the earlier edition, and its clear this is a volume that belongs on the shelves of every Civil War buff or instructor, as well as any other interested party.Highly recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 29, 2015,076034776X,Hallowed Ground: A Walk at Gettysburg,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076034776X,Zenith Press,$22.63
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,2,Not for Embroidery,I purchased this stencil to use as an embroidery pattern for baby bibs and blankets. I figured if all went well, maybe I'd get some more of them. But when trying to trace the insides with a fabric marker, the lines inside were so fine that I couldn't get a very exact shape. The lion's face is too big and his mane is too small.I haven't done any embroidery since the 1980's, and back then my mother told me the cheapest way to get decent patterns was to go buy a child's coloring book and pull out the best pages. After my disappointing experience with this stencil, I got back online. When I had searched for free embroidery patterns, I didn't have a lot of luck, but when I put &#34;coloring pages for children&#34; in the search bar, I got way more adorable patterns for absolutely free than I will ever even need. True, I will have to puncture the pattern in order to apply the fabric marker, but I have done that before and already know it works.Long story short--for embroidery purposes, this stencil is both unsatisfactory and an unnecessary expenditure.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 1, 2015,B001B2R07C,Plaid:Delta Stencil Mania, 7 by 10-Inch, Wild Animals,Arts, Crafts & Sewing,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B2R07C,Plaid:Delta,$9.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Excellent Value and Rolls Easily,Wanted to buy the great big bags of dog food online; neither the mister nor I can pick up a great big bag to haul it into the kitchen anymore. I bought this device figuring we can drag the bag inside the front door, and then I can sit down and empty some of the bag into this container and wheel it into the kitchen. We have done this successfully, and it rolls with no catching or hitches.The fifth star is denied because the clasps that hold the lids shut are slightly finicky. But on the other hand, if it were made of more expensive materials, it would probably cost more.The scoop is well balanced and well constructed. It doesn't drop kibbles over the sides when I take the scoop from the rolling container to the dog's dish.I didn't need the container on top, but since I have it, I use it to store the dog's pill pockets in when I give him his medicine.For the record, I also priced this on the bargain site that starts with G, and amazon came out 20% cheaper not counting the fact that the other place will charge me postage.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Works for us!,This was my birthday gift from my spouse, and I had requested it. We have a fairly good size kitchen that has no work island between it and the dining room, and my teenager and I were trying to use the same counter area to chop things for dinner. I wanted an island, but I didn't want to remodel my kitchen; I just redid my floors and we didn't want to spend a bunch on it. Although I would have liked some storage below with doors to hide stuff and keep it dust-free, the extra amount we'd have to pay made no sense to me.I read the reviews (thanks guys), and it sounded as if this would work. The fifth star would be here if there were a wood top one could chop on; it's kind of deceptive to make it look like one when it isn't. However, I have a clear glass cutting board I am not using, and it was just the right size to put on top.Assembly: the spouse (who is mechanically inclined) put it together in an hour. He noted that the drawer, which pulls out for a second work surface, will keep coming until it is out if you pull without thinking, cause there is no stopper.I noted that you wouldn't want to chop anything seriously weighty, or where you'd have to bear down, on the pull-out board; it isn't a watermelon kind of surface.On the happy end: towel rack is generous and stable. Wheels have a nifty, easy turn to them, and will go around a tight corner. The shelves underneath are stronger than they look; I figured to put a crock pot on one and a rice steamer on the other (and for now, I have done), but noted that they are sturdy enough to hold more. The knife block is a nice addition and good size for 2 small-to-medium knives and one large.Add to that the free shipping and the Prime speed, and it was completely irresistible.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Comic Caper; Ribald Humor,Hugely imaginative, terribly funny, and utterly tasteless, Kakonis delivers the chortles with Treasure Coast, a comic caper that juggles numerous entertaining characters with surprising deftness. Thank you twice, first to Brash Books and second to Net Galley, for providing me with the DRC to review.Our tale begins with Uncle Jim Merriman, a professional gambler who cant even manage to break even these days, and his numbnuts nephew, Leon Cody,  this kid with the crop of wild hair and Magoo glasses and dippy grin, who is in debt to loan sharks. Leons mother has died and left not only her body, but also her foolish son, to Uncle Jims care and keeping. And of course we have the sharks collection agents, Morris Junior Biggs and your badass Hector Pasadena.On the other hand, we have Bryce Bott, hustler of gravestones that once purchased, will never arrive and s&eacute;ances delivered with the help of his hillbilly sidekick, Waneta Jean, who feigns nearness to death as a part of the s&eacute;ance scam.Of course, ultimately, the characters wind up in a messy pile trying out-scam each other. Circles inside of circles, games within games.But oh, thats not enough! We also have trophy bride Billie Swett, who within my mental movie soon became Bernadette Peters, and her obnoxious, porcine, but almost infinitely wealthy spouse, Big Lonnie Swett. Eventually we add Cheetah, to whom Reverend Bott referred as that other intrusive fellow. Their roles in all of this, you will have to find out on your own.And how do you count the ways of weird?This was a story worthy of patience. There were so many nasty racist comments made about almost everyone you can think of; however, they are used within the context of Juniors vapor-brained, Aryan sensibilities. There are several horribly ugly sexist remarks using the worst possible terms you can imagine, but again, it is only the bad guys that use them and a reckoning comes down in a manner I found deeply satisfying.To put it another way: we were halfway through before I was even sure I liked this novel, but once I was on board, I was in it for keeps, flagging one clever passage after another, most of which I cant share here.So although I was ultimately dumbstruck by the creativity with which Kakonis wove all of the complicated strands of this story together without dropping a single one, I also caution the reader. There are some really crass, fairly specific references to corpses in this book. If you have just lost someone and the wound is still raw, this is probably not the title with which you should escape. There are repeated references to the joys of rape. If you or someone near to you has been down that brutal path, maybe this is not your story, either. And one more caveat before I can go back to singing praises: if your mother tongue is not English, you may not want to embrace this challenging novel, which despite its Keystone Cops-like atmosphere requires exceedingly strong vocabulary skills. For those that enjoy word play, its a real treat, but any time you have to look up more than 3 words per page, the effort will outweigh the enjoyment you receive.With the above caveats in mind, this new release comes highly recommended by this reviewer.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,September 15, 2015,B00KAJXAWG,Treasure Coast,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAJXAWG,Brash Books,$3.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Personal Glimpse is Compelling Reading,Suddenly, everyone is writing Nixon biographies; its a Watergate junkies dream come true! Here Thomas does his best to take us inside Nixons skin and tell us what motivated some of the decidedly strange things he did. It makes for highly engaging reading. 3.75 stars get rounded up to 4, along with my thanks to Net Galley and Random House for the DRC. This book is available for sale now.When I signed on for this galley, I imagined that perhaps Thomas had a background in psychology or psychiatry and was going to take a stab at diagnosing a mental illness that might explain what in the world Nixon was thinking when he did the things he did; if hed had different meds, would things have shaken out differently? But that isnt what this book is about. Instead, it is a glimpse at Nixons life, including his early childhood and adolescence, postulating that childhood experiences may have shaped the politician Nixon became.To this, I will admit that I said, Psssh. Right. Whatever.Because its a plain and simple fact that many presidents had lives that were scarred by events as bad or worse than what Nixon experienced, and most of them still managed to do their jobs without coming within a hairs breadth of impeachment. So I dont buy that theory.Nevertheless, there are so many interesting tidbits and stories in this memoir that even if the reader doesnt buy the overall thesis, its a compelling read. The conversational narrative kept me rolling along, and every time I found an opinion I thought was baloney, I made a note of it and kept going. I would have continued reading even if I didnt have an obligation to the publisher, because it really is fascinating stuff.Imagine, for instance, a solitary candidate with a love for classical music, sitting all by himself in his hotel suite, with the 1812 Overture blasting away, with his arms furiously directing an unseen orchestra. Just one aide saw this, and Thomas ferreted the incident out and presented it here. I doubt youll find these tidbits anywhere else!In addition, few other biographers have managed any insights into what went on in the Nixon residence. I often wondered about Pat, Tricia, and Julie. When he showed up to home, did he storm in and turn the coffee table over? Get quietly drunk? Blame his family for all his ills? Drawing heavily on the memoirs written by family members that I am unlikely to ever read, Thomas gives us a little voyeuristic peek behind the curtains, and I found it intriguing indeed.When it comes to Watergate, Thomas holds Nixon responsible for what he did, for the greater part, but I rolled my eyes at the repeated claim that if he hadnt been too shy to socialize with the staff, with the Washington socialites who invited him to dinners, and so forth, maybe he would not have become so isolated if his childhood hadnt been so poor, and if his father hadnt kept him home from his Yale scholarship because there was no money for dorm fees if if if I felt much more certain that the authors research, which is mostly done via secondary sources and the Nixon familys memoirs, including heavy use of Nixons own (RN), was based on fact when he dealt directly with Nixons personal life. Although various quotes by the Watergate conspirators were interesting, some are more believable than others. I found one fact in this bio that directly conflicts with that of biographer Tim Weiner, and it has to do with the choice of Spiro Agnew as a running mate. Thomas cites reasons personal and political; Weiner documents that the choice was bought and paid for by Greek financial interests. Here, I believe Weiner. Its just one directly conflicting fact, but when I found it, just as a humble reviewer rather than as a researcher, it called other things into question, which is where ¼ star fell off this review.The author thanks a number of people in his after-notes. I always read those, because you can pick up little things lost elsewhere. He especially thanks the man that told him to beware the various items found in the prodigious memoirs by that old thespian, Richard Nixon, who was a student actor before he went into politics. It was strong advice.In perusing this biography, I realized two things. The first is that the reason Nixon had so little domestic policy, and the reason the country moved so smoothly without him during the tortuous period prior to his departure, is because he didnt have much of a tool kit to start with. The author notes that although Nixon has gained a sinister reputation as an evil, sneaking genius, in fact there were areas in which he really wasnt all that smart, and this was one of them. He focused on three things: foreign policy, in which he was better equipped to carry out the wishes of the bourgeoisie than most presidents have been; running for office again and when that was done, honing his legacy, about which enough has been said; and of course, revenge, revenge, revenge.The second thing I realized is that the reason he was virtually cast out of office in a situation in which other presidents might have been able to pull their chestnuts out of the fire, had to do with the fact that he believed himself, as US president, to be more powerful than the ruling bourgeoisie. He misjudged the relationship of power between himself and those that rule us quietly, usually in an unseen way. In attempting to yank the broadcasting license of CBS as part of a personal vendetta against the owner of the Washington Post, he took on a sector of the ruling rich, and he made of himself an object lesson.By my count, this was my twelfth Nixon biography, though I may have read and forgot about some others. Its neither the best nor the worst, but for those fascinated with Nixons rise and fall, and with Watergate, it should go on the to-read list. Its just too good to miss!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 28, 2015,0812995368,Being Nixon: A Man Divided,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812995368,Random House,$21.35
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Surreal Thriller; Absorbing and Spooky!,Hard Rain is a nail-biter of a suspense novel, part mystery and part espionage thriller, and Peter Abrahams is a writer with credentials as long as your arm, including being Stephen Kings favorite American suspense novelist. After reading this skillfully woven tale I can see why. My thanks go to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media for the free galley. It was one wild ride!Hard Rain is set in the period after Vietnam, but prior to the time when satellites revolutionized our means of communication. Our opening scenes involve a mysterious, sinister fellow named Bao Dai. His murder of a stranger for no apparent reason sets the reader on edge, and the surreal tone the writer lends is better than anything I have ever seen. In fact, the writing style and pacing are so brilliant that until I stumbled across some unexpected but fairly glaring problems in the last quarter of the book, it was headed for a five star review and a home on my favorites list. But more about that later.Our chief problem, once the initial set up flashes past us, is that Jessies daughter is missing. Her ex-husband, Pat Rodney, took her for the weekend. They were going to go fishing, and then she was going to be returned to Jessie in time for a birthday party. But they never made it to the fishing boat, and there are some ominous messages on Pats answering machine. Kate never came home, and Jessie has no clue where she is.The cops arent all that concerned, seeing it as a routine custody violation that will surely be resolved on its own, but Pat has never been responsible, and has never ever wanted full custody; Jessie just doesnt think he would snatch her. Her best friend, Barbara, is a no-holds-barred lawyer, and shes ready to get down to business, but she is killed by a hit and run driver as she goes to cross Jessies street, wearing Jessies yellow rain slicker. That one person was the entire cavalry; now Jessie is on her own.It just doesnt look good.The trail takes Jessie to Bennington College in Vermont. Pat was originally from Vermont, and she thinks he may have gone home, or at least contacted his family. And once there, all hell breaks loose. A particularly harrowing scene involves a chase scene in a subterranean tunnel beneath the dormitories.A parallel storyline that blinks in and out has to do with an aging spy named Zyzmchuk, who is about to be sent out to pasture. Keith and Dahlin, a snappy, younger pair of more business-like spooks, plan one further adventure for Zyz in the hope that when its over, hell either be dead or leave quietly. These two, for some reason, made me think of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, the two sinister advisers that did President Nixons bidding at times, and at other times kept him on a leash to keep him from acting crazier than he already was. Maybe its because I am also reading Tim Weiners galley about the Nixon presidency. I have to say that of all the myriad characters that wink in and out of this complex, deliberately disorienting story, Keith and Dahlin are my favorites.The imagery, with water and falling being constant themes throughout this spooky story, is among the best I have read, together with a deceptively simple sentence pattern that creates suspense in something of a house-that-Jack-built fashion. I still cant figure out how he does it. Its uncanny, and really absorbing.So, even with the problems toward the end, is this creepy novel worth your time and money? Assuming you enjoy this sort of story, I have to say yes, it is. In fact, this writer won the Edgar earlier in his career, and that early title is now on my to-read list. I probably wont find it as a galley, which means I have to hunt it down at the library, or fish around for it on my annual pilgrimage to Powells City of Books. So what follows was not enough to cross this writer off my A list, by any means. And now if you read further, there are going to be spoilers, so if you want to read this yourself and not know how the ending shakes outor at least bits of itthis is the place to quit reading. And for those skimming, I will make it more obvious:*****SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT!!!*****We are 75% of the way into the story. Jessie has been beaten by bad guys, and has been rescued, medical attention sought by our very own spook, Zyzmchuk. He is keeping an eye on her partly for her own good (awww), but also so that she doesnt get in his way, because her mission interferes with part of his. He sets a guard to watch her when he has to go out, but otherwise, he sits in a chair in her hotel room there in New England, keeping watch over her. She is a sweet young thing still; he is retirement age.And so there she is, with a nasty concussion and a number of other bad injuries, worried about her missing child, and so what would be more natural than inviting this duffer, a man as ancient as I am now, to come climb in bed with her so they can have great sex?What the hell?Shoot, said Dahlin.(pretend those oo's are one i)duck, said Keith. (but with an f)Okay, that quote belongs much earlier in the book (and more than once), but I like it here just as well, so I have taken the liberty of inserting it. Because really what is that about? Did someone in marketing decide the book needed some gratuitous sex in order to sell properly? Go figure.At the 85% we have to wonder whether some bad editor also cut out a chunk of story that should have been more judiciously and lightly pruned, because when Jessie sneaks out of her hotel room to try to find her daughter, she returns to find that Zyz, the guard Zyz posted while he stepped out, and all other apparent spooks and body guards have decamped. We, the readers, know that the guard in her hotel room was killed after she snuck out, but we dont know where the hell Zyz went. And the next time we run across him, he is strolling into his office in Washington as if nothing untoward ever occurred. There is never any real explanation for this bizarre leap in the plot.All that said, once again, I would happily read more of this authors work. His capacity to create a frisson of chilly suspense far outweighs the Hollywood-like choice to dump the hot chick in bed with the old guy, as well as what may have been an editors error toward the conclusion.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT!*****This book will be released digitally July 28. What better way to spend summer break? Just stay out of the water, and definitely keep an eye on your kids. You wont want them out of your sight while you read this story!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 23, 2015,0525245812,Hard Rain,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525245812,Dutton Adult,$0.01
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Brilliant Literature; Cozy Mystery; Historical Fiction, Take Your Pick,As a rule, I am not fond of British fiction; I prefer working class protagonists to the silver-spoon variety; and I like urban settings more than pastoral ones. But The Lake House is written by the author that produced The Forgotten Garden, and so when I had the chance to grab the galley, I went for it. And once more, experience proves that a brilliant writer can sell any story, in the setting of her choice, with the protagonists of her choice, and she can make it flow smooth as warm butter. This deep, luminous story came to me from Net Galley and Atria Books, a division of Simon and Schuster. Thank you once, twice, and a third time too, because Morton has done it again. The book is a must-read for all that love mysteries and literary fiction.Sadie Sparrow works for the Metropolitan Police, but her job hangs by a thread because she has become over-involved in the case of a missing woman. A toddler was found abandoned in her home, and Sparrow is haunted by the insistence of the childs grandmother that her daughter would never, ever leave the child intentionally. Sparrow has been told to take some time off and stay away from the case; she retreats to her grandfathers home in Cornwall, and becomes transfixed by an older, colder case, that of the mysterious disappearance of a child that lived in the beautiful old home nearby, Loeanneth, where a baby boy vanished many years earlier. Sadie sublimates her urge to follow up on her current, forbidden case by poking into the old mystery in Cornwall.Morton takes us deftly from one setting, both time and place, to another so seamlessly that we cannot help being spellbound; this is literary fiction at its best. We meet the various members of the family that once summered in the once-lovely, now neglected Cornwall estate, and we watch across the years over three generations of the Edevane family that lived there, both in the years before World War II up to the present, with its elderly descendants that remain living.Rather than a gripping page-turner, this is a well-crafted tale to be sunk into, like a feather bed or ones favorite chair, with the phone turned off and a steaming cup of coffee (or tea, if you must) to go with it. Those without the stamina for a complex, well-developed story of the necessary length will find themselves frustrated; this one is for true literature lovers, so be prepared to give it the time it deserves.The characters are developed so expertly that they feel like people we have known a long time. My favorite was Eleanor, who in my own mental movie appeared as a young Vanessa Redgrave; readers of a later generation than mine will choose some other face to match Mortons description. Every possible stereotype one might create having to do with women of that time and social station has been cleverly sidestepped in a fully credible manner. Even the haughtiest among them is presented with dignity and a certain grace.Some will find the ending a little too perfectly resolved perhaps; I find it congenial.The best news of all is that this outstanding novel has just been released, so you can get it now. It would make a great holiday gift for someone you love, or you could just indulge yourself for now instead. Do it quickly, before it is sold out. A solid five-star read by an outstanding author.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,October 24, 2015,1451649320,The Lake House: A Novel,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451649320,Atria Books,$15.40
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Nothing Fancy, But Works Just Fine,I need two pairs of tongs, one downstairs to reach high items off kitchen shelves and use to get sock out of the bottom of the washing machine, and another for the barbecue. One pair went missing over the winter, and so I bought these. Then I found the missing pair. Figures.However, it gives me a basis for comparison. Lengthwise, this pair falls right between the pair that had been lost, which were actually a little too short for comfortable barbecuing. They are shorter than the pair I use in kitchen and laundry, and for me that is good, because too much length makes picking up a pound of t-bone steak really unwieldy.When I barbecue, I use the largest Weber kettle drum sold for domestic use, and I also use thick, heat-proof gloves that go almost to my elbow. I am a shorter-than-average woman, five foot three, so if you are tall, or if you are using a larger barbecue or a barbecue pit, these may not be what you are looking for. The serrated ends bend just about right, and are rough enough to assist me in picking up a steak, chicken, or portabello mushroom off of the grill without tearing into the food and ruining its looks. The tension is just right, not floppy enough to give way before I am ready to let go of what I am gripping, but not so tight that it requires too much physical strength (arthritis).These are lightweight metal, and the wood part looks well enough attached to get me through two or three summers. It's not going to be a family heirloom, but I don't need it to do that. There is a tag on the end so you can hang it on a hook if you choose; I don't use that feature. I am pretty sure they are not dishwasher safe, but a dot of dish soap and a little hot water, and they're ready to use again.In short, for the ordinary home barbecue, and assuming you also wear heat proof gloves (which you ought to anyway), these are money well spent.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 4, 2015,B00IJB8F3G,16" Luxury Oak Barbecue / Grill Tongs - Mr Grill,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJB8F3G,Mr Grill,$11.95
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Spell-binding Survival Tale Will Brighten Your Day!,At one point I promised myself, no more Holocaust memoirs! I cant change history, and I know enough. I am retired. Why make myself feel worse? But then this wonderful biography became available, thanks to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media; thank you to both of them for the free DRC. Not only was it worth delving back into this difficult period in history, but it kept me awake till 2 AM because I could not put it down unfinished. What a terrific story!Many of those of us that have studied the Holocaust, whether for reasons of family and culture, historical interest, or something else, have maxed out on the horror, the numbers, the gut-wrenching details. This book isnt more of that. Instead, it is the remarkable true story of Jewish Germans that found a way to conceal themselves, not only in Nazi-occupied Europe, but in Berlin itself. Within the belly of the beast, there were still some good people left. There were people that would house the Arndt family members; there were those who had no space or were too afraid to do that, but who would provide food; and there were those who took no active role, but were willing to see, and to say nothing. And perhaps more than anything, there were seven really smart people who were determined not to die, and who beat the odds by surviving till the Russians came in to rescue them.Young people are often the quickest to respond appropriately when big changes occur quickly, and so it was with the Arndts. Dr. Arndt had grown up in Germany as a member of a respected family, and he was reluctant to give up on the German government as a source of justice and order. He had fought in World War I, and didnt think his country would allow him or his loved ones to be hurt. Erich, his son, thought differently. Ultimately, it was the teenagers, Erich and Ruth, who persuaded their parents that they had to disappear. In fact, they tossed down an ultimatum: disappear, or we will disappear without you! To keep the family together, the doctor and his wife, Lina, complied with their childrens wishes, and it is a very good thing they did so.Once Goebbels, the monstrous architect of Nazi Germanys final solution to its Jewish scapegoats, declared Berlin to be completely free of Jews, a lot of Germans believed him. For most of them, it was not really an important issue; they were more concerned with paying their bills and finding food than with spying on the neighbors. The truth was that more than 5,000 Jews had slipped by the cops, soldiers, and members of the SS; of those, 1,600 managed to hide somewhere until the whole thing was over. However, this was the only family to emerge intactnot that no one in their family died, but that seven of them managed to ease themselves in and out of safe houses, factories, even basements and sheds, with the help of the doctors former patients and others who were willing to do the right thing.Its enough to give us faith in humanity, because there was a good deal of both real and perceived risk in doing so.Wouldnt you like to read some good news for a change? Lovenheims survival tale is fantastic. I was spellbound both by the bold, clever things done by the family membersespecially the young folksand by the inspirational actions and words of those that could not look away, who just had to help in spite of what could happen to them if they were caught.Highly recommended, and recently released, this one is a real day-brightener.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Brilliant, Witty, Absorbing Noir Fiction,Mark Smith is one helluva writer. The Death of the Detective is complex yet hazy, with a million details both enumerated and obfuscated, not unlike a day in Chicago, the city in which it is set. All told, an enormously satisfying read. Tremendous thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for the DRC.The time period is the post-war era. With the Great Depression well behind it and World War II a recent triumph, the USA is at the pinnacle of its wealth and worldwide power. Death of a Detective is spun around the lives of a handful of men , all Chicago during this time period, men whose lives intersect and then trail away from each other, sometimes joining again, and sometimes not. The style is a lot like that last sentence, compound sentences that last a long time and yet build up to something rather becoming unwieldy. I have never read a voice like his before.But back to our story. First we have the protagonist, Magnuson. He is retired from his life as the head of a locally famous security firm, and life has not been the same after his wife died. He is depressed. He's invited old friends over to play cards and perhaps talk about their glory days, but the evening is ruined, because one of them has invited a man he detests without consulting Magnuson first. He is so irritated that eventually he abandons his guests and goes to bed. If only he would stay there!Next up we have Farquarson, at least for a short time. Farquarson is a wealthy old man, and a mean one. Perhaps it is fortunate that he is dying. Unfortunately, he has just enough time and evil intent to send out a number of extremely unkind messages, some of them whispered, others sent as poison pen letters through the US mail. Once he is gone, his parting actions send things spinning in all sorts of directions, disrupting and ending the lives of good and decent people...and others' also.In addition there is Cavan. Cavan has lived his life in the self-absorbed, irresponsible, idly dilettantish manner of a sole heir to a vast fortune. After all, Farquarson has no children, and he is the only nephew. He spends and drinks recklessly while planning his scholarly (and expensive) trip to Africa. His field is anthropology, and his budget is one he assumes to be bottomless. What a surprise he has awaiting him.Finally, we have our assassin. The man would probably be considered bipolar today; he has delusions of grandeur and a lot of other strange notions too. He was committed to a psychiatric hospital, but then getting over the wall is sometimes just a matter of persistence and athletic ability. Once he is out, he takes on a number of identities, foremost among them, Death. How fortunate, then, that he has wandered into a murder mystery where he can be useful.At times, Smith's noir fiction is reminiscent of the late, great Donald Westlake. At one point I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud over a wry turn of events.Smith's well-braided story also pulls in additional supporting players with more limited roles. We have a klatch of criminals, members of an organized syndicate, and we also have some hoods that want in and will do terrible things to prove themselves. We have local cops. We also have an assortment of young people associated with Cavan, as well as ordinary people across whose paths our story marches.Because we're all in this together, ultimately.One thing of which the prospective reader should be aware is that the main characters are all Caucasian, and they are generally racist. The "N" word drops in now and then, and although its use is entirely consistent with the characters who are either using it out loud or thinking it--think of white Chicago businessmen and cops during the 1950s and 1960s--it is jarring. Perhaps it would have been more offensive simply to assume, as many writers still do, that characters in the story are all Caucasian; yet I think I would have enjoyed the novel more without that particular word, and perhaps with fewer racist statements and thoughts by the characters involved. This is my sole complaint about what is otherwise a truly outstanding mystery.Smith is brilliant at conveying the emotions and thoughts of his characters through action. This reviewer was hooked at the end of the first paragraph, when the man in the diner cut his meat and then stole the knife. Smith's internal dialogues are lengthy but so well done that rather than reacting with impatience, the reader must instead feel as if she is getting extra time with a remarkable story for no extra cost. His facility with figurative language, particularly simile, metaphor, and repetition are so skillful that I found myself flagging pages to share with students I no longer teach. It was both wondrous and disappointing.I no longer have my students, but I have you, reader, and unlike most of them, you read what I have to say by choice. Pay attention! Sit up straight! Spit out your gum! Oh hell, I'm sorry; I forgot myself for a moment.What I really want to point out is that not only do I consider this book well worth your time and money, but it was nominated for a National Book Award, and the author has an impressive list of credentials. But had he not, I would still recommend this amazing novel on its own merits. Originally released in 2007, it was re-released February 3, 2015.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Not Really Single Use, Silly!,In years gone by, when the fly population in the house got to be annoying, I would tuck a piece of old-fashioned fly paper near the kitchen window where it wasn't too obvious, and it worked. When it was ready to be thrown away, I could cheaply replace it. This year, though, we tossed our old heavy drapes and put light new shades in the dining room. The flies all wanted to hang out in the dining room window, and I could not place flypaper right where our eyes would be drawn while we ate. Gross. So I figured I would try this fly trap.Here's the deal: the picture looks as if you don't see the flies inside, but actually, that yellow label has all the instructions on it, and when you pull it out, you have a cup greatly resembling a plastic drinking cup that you might get at the movies or fast food places. You will still see all the flies. But the good news is that instead of hanging it by the cheesy, awkward little hanger on top, you can just set it somewhere--such as our dining room windowsill--when nobody is going to be there except those flies. Dinner time comes, I move the cup away. Dinner is over, I go put it back.The worst part, which would have made this review 2 stars if I hadn't found a way around it, is that it is intended to be single use. The little packet of fly bait does not divulge what is inside, apart from that it isn't poisonous (the flies are going to get tired and drown, not be poisoned). It vows to work for a couple of hours. So do you really want to buy one of these cups for every day of summer to keep your house free of flies? Of course not.After a Google search, my daughter and I mixed some orange juice, a little dish soap, and a dash of vinegar in the bottom of the cup (after dumping the old solution and a dozen dead flies in the back yard). Works just fine. Eventually the plastic will get old and break on us, but if I only have to buy one or two more of these this summer, I'm okay with that.The container is very cheaply built, so don't plan on modifying it or trying to do anything fancy in terms of placement.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 16, 2015,B00004RBDZ,Victor M502 Disposable Fly Trap,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RBDZ,Victor,$5.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,3,Comfortable, Fits Well, Needs Stitching Reinforced Under Arms,Your basic caftan is ideal for schlumping around the house on a day off. It's very comfy against the skin. It doesn't absorb perspiration, but you can tell that by checking the fabric content. No one knows or cares if you are wearing a bra when one of these is on...except for when the stitching under the arms starts to come loose. I've had this item only since spring, worn it several times and washed it twice. I am very gentle with it, never pulling or yanking it when I sit down or go for a nap. Make sure not to stress the armholes...and yet 3 stitches have already come loose, so now you can see boobs through one arm hole.

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,4,Brief, Enjoyable Baseball Bio,This baseball bio was written a long time ago and is now available digitally. Thank you to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media for allowing me an advance glimpse in exchange for my review.Lou Gehrig, Iron Man&#34;, the first baseman who served alongside Babe Ruth on the Yankees' Murderers Row in the 1920's, was the kind of athlete you don't read about much these days. He was born so poor that he went through New York City winters without a coat to wear to school. His parents were German immigrants who had never heard of baseball; he himself was a hard working, clean living young man who dropped out of Columbia University to play ball because his father was sick and his parents needed the money. He kept a clean mouth, was faithful to his wife, and didn't abuse the press or his fellow athletes. The terrible disease that would be named after him killed him before he hit forty.The biography is unusually short, just 77 pages long. Ordinarily I don't prefer to read anything that brief, but I've mowed through some baseball biographies in the past year already, and I decided 77 pages was as much as I was good for on this subject. However, this was well done enough that I would have been willing to keep reading had it gone longer.Gallico, Gehrig's biographer, is eloquent, using what would now be considered a prosy, old-fashioned style, sentimental, and deeply affectionate. He was a legendary sportswriter himself back in the day, but quit in order to write fiction; he is also the author of The Poseidon Adventure.Recommended to those that love baseball, or just a good biography.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,June 16, 2015,B00TGJJ13S,Lou Gehrig: Pride of the Yankees,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TGJJ13S,Open Road Media,$7.99
SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,For Those Who Barbecue Often,I bought one of these because I had read that regular charcoal, especially combined with fruit wood and/or hickory, produces a much more pleasing flavor than the more expensive activated charcoal. To avoid using chemicals to start the fire, one uses a chimney (instructions are included and are pretty clear.) I found that even when just barbecuing for the three of us still here at home, one chimney doesn't really produce enough hot coal for a barbecue. After fighting with it all last summer, trying to start the coals and then burn an additional chimney's worth to add afterward, I finally went ahead and got myself a second one this summer. Now it's just right for a standard kettle barbecue. I dump one chimney's worth of hot coals (to where the edges are graying, so you know they are burning) off to one side of the bottom rack of my Weber barbecue, and the other off to the other side. Put my salmon wrapped loosely in foil right in the middle, so it gets heat on either side but none directly underneath. I have done the same thing with shishkabobs, ribs, burgers, vegies, and steak.It takes time to get the hang of it, but the food tastes better; I am not filling my family full of creepy chemicals as I was when I used starter fluid or activated charcoal; and I also save a mess of money, because now I can buy the big, cheap bags of charcoal.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,July 21, 2015,B000WEOQV8,Weber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter,Patio, Lawn & Garden,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WEOQV8,Weber,$14.99

SeattleBookMama,A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,5,Kick-ass Female Sleuth a Great Mystery Find,Anybody talk to a doctor?Guy came out of emergency and talked to the brother.Hear what he said?Just that they were very concerned with Marks condition, and were doing all they could.S***. Mark wont make it then. Theyre already hanging the crepe.Sonora Blair is one of the most kick-ass female detectives to hit the shelves in a very long time. Lucky me, I read it free, thanks to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media. The original publication date was 1995, and so the initial publishers must have dropped the ball big-time when it came to promotion, because I know this is the kind of story that resonates with large numbers of people, especially women. And I am glad to see it being resold by Open Road, because they know how to do the job right.So back to Sonora. No wait, lets go back to Hightower first. What a total bad-ass when it comes to setting! I loved seeing her enter the home where her children were asleep, and the explosion of naked Barbie doll parts in her daughters room. I loved the moment when her elderly dog had an accident in the living room, and she was so distracted by the hundred other things, personal and professional, all colliding at once, that it was not even the first thing she took care of once she found it.So we have two interesting threads here. One is the problem. A killer out there has murdered a man by handcuffing him to the steering wheel of a vehicle and setting fire to it and him. Its grisly business, but Hightower doesnt overwork the detail to where it triggers my ick button; in other words, although its terrible, it is never so terrible that I just dont want to read it anymore. And the problem just becomes thornier and trickier the longer she works on it. Clues drop here and there, and the stakes go up.The other thread is Blairs personal life, and the problems she faces in dealing with home and work. It sounds like a tired old song when I put it that way, but like any really skillful writing, it sounds brand new when the author rubs her own brand of English on it and sends it spinning.After having read several hundred mystery, crime fiction, police procedural, and thriller novelsokay, if I had starting keeping track sooner, I know it would be well over a thousandthere are a handful of devices that are so frequently used that my eyes auto-roll when I see them utilized. I was watching for them. But Blair never gets tossed into the trunk of anybodys car; she never gets the phone call saying the killer has her kids; there is never a moment when we realize she has been framed for the killing herself, and has to solve it to save her own butt. Im not saying a great writer cant get away with any of those; there are some Grand Masters out there that have done it and before my eyes could make the full roll, they were glued back to the page. But once someone reaches into that worn, soiled bag of tricks, it becomes a lot harder to engage me, and I was delighted that Blair never went there.Her facility with setting is consistently brilliant throughout the book.One tiny odd bit: for the first chapter or two, I was convinced that Blair was African-American. When she turned up blonde later, I had to mentally reinvent her. It didnt take long though, because I was riveted and had to get back to the story.For fans of outstanding detective fiction, this is a must-read. Order it now for yourself, or as a gift for someone you know will love it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV,November 7, 2015,B01543FEAI,Flashpoint (The Sonora Blair Mysteries Book 1),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01543FEAI,Open Road Media Mystery & Thriller,$6.15

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Good out-of-box experience,I usually don't write reviews of a tool until I've used it quite a bit, but I'm going to make an exception in this case because there is only one other review. I would like to thank Jim, the first reviewer, as his comments inspired me to take the plunge and try this product.This Hitachi NP35A is my first micro pinner, although I do own and use a few larger pneumatic tools (15 gauge nailer, 18 gauge nailer, 2 staplers). I typically prefer to use screws rather than nails, but there are occasions when the unique attributes of a power driver nail outweighs it's many disadvantages.Here are my first impressions of the Hitachi NP35A 23 Gauge Nailer.Pros: o compact, lightweight, and comfortable to hold. o high quality product, for example magazine slides in and out with smooth precision. o trigger is comfortable, double trigger is relatively easy to get used to. o the soft nose tip leaves no mark whatsoever on even soft woods. o very quiet, pleasant to use (no hearing protection needed with this little guy). o easy side loading of pins, and automatically adjusts to different pin sizes. o using the soft tip, appropriate air pressure, and good technique, pins are driven to a perfect depth just below the surface (the depth is adjustable via the use of a hex wrench on the nose piece). o surprising nice blow molded plastic case. o an easy to see bright orange "low pin indicator" (of course, it doesn't work if one is not paying attention and doesn't look at it ... just one of my many faults I'm afraid....) o although the minimum specified pin length is 5/8", I was able to use the 3/8" pins without a problem (this is quite a good thing, for my projects). o made in Taiwan (often a significant step up in quality compared to China made goods).Cons: o the manual has a few typos (e.g. "all crews must be tightened..."), and it is bloated with the usual tedious and uninformative safety stuff (dictated by lawyers, presumably), but really, you can probably see that I'm nit-picking here.Notes:I have tested this product primarily with Western Fir (actually harder than many "hard woods"), and a sample piece of 100 year old clear white oak (recovered from a badly broken desk). As long as one presses the tip firmly to the wood all pins are driven flush, although one does have to crank up the air pressure a bit for longer pins and harder wood.I used Grex 23 gauge pins (since they come in a convenient multi-size package, available here on amazon for about ten dollars).The longest pin length I tried was 1". This gun is specified to be able to handle 1-3/8, and I do not doubt that it will, but for now I can't see myself needing or wanting to drive these incredibly tiny, thin little needles into anything that would require longer lengths. However I know that many people do use much longer pins. Perhaps as I become more comfortable and experienced with this tool I too will join the super-sized crowd.As you probably know, these pins are much smaller than 18 gauge brads, and much less noticeable. However, they are not invisible, especially in lighter woods. Nonetheless, they are much less visually distracting than their 18 gauge cousins. Also, if you build small things (say drawer inserts using 3/16" thick dividers) an 18 gauge brad is simply too big - it would split the wood - whereas a 23 gauge pin works very nicely (along with a bit of glue).Hope this information is helpful to you.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 5, 2010,B003SHDM84,Hitachi NP35A 1-3/8" 23-Gauge Pin Nailer,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SHDM84,Hitachi,$89.00
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,3,So, What's Up With That Chair?,Review of Smart Things Ubiquitous Computing User Experience DesignSo, What's Up With the Chair?Is it just me, or did anyone else wonder about the intriguing chair embossed on the front cover? I don't believe the author writes about chairs anywhere in the entire book. Indeed, there is scant mention of any kind of furniture aside from a 1 page sidebar.I decided to review this book after previewing the section about Moore's Law. I was impressed with the author's insights and observations about this apparently misunderstood "law". Now that I've read the entire book, and taken some time to think about it, I must say I learned a few interesting things from it.The book attempts to provide an introduction to ideas and techniques useful in ubiquitous computing user experience design. It does this by providing a little history, some design frameworks and methodologies, complimented by case studies of commercial products.There are a some intellectual gems here, such as the author's observation that "design is as much a process of discovering constraints as creating within them". Or, the idea that most every industrially created product has an "information shadow", which is the digitally accessible information about it.I especially like the concept of "smart garbage", in which objects self-disclose how to fix, disassemble and recycle them.If you are a designer, some of the author's recommended techniques such as the "desire line method" (see where people are walking and making paths across the grass, then install your sidewalks there) are worth considering. Advice that a product "has to work for someone before it can work for anyone" is worth keeping in mind, and could prove to be a great persuading tool in heated design meetings.I particularly liked the author's ideas about metaphors. They are "the tools of thought" and allow consumers of novel gadgets to comprehend them by relating them to concrete concepts.I am thankful to the author for helping me understand why I so much dislike being present when a robot vacuum cleaner (Roomba) is operating: "they were designed to emulate insect behavior". (And I hate bugs.)So, what's not like?Well, a few things actually.In addition to insects, I hate typo's. No author, and no book is perfect, and so I have developed the ability to ignore the existence of a reasonable number of typo's without undue discomfort. However this book has exceeded my pain threshold. Typo agony begins even before the first page of the book, in the third paragraph of the Preface ("user experience design from a different perspectives:"). And there are unfortunately more to follow, including footnotes in the sidebar, mixed up labels, and so on.The writing is sometimes obscure, as if the reader is assumed to have prior detailed knowledge about what is being said (in that case, why read the book?). For example, on the last page of chapter 15 the author shows a photo of two wooden blocks, with mating wooden joints facing each other, and sliding doors opened to reveal circuit boards hidden within. His description is "Cottram (2009) for example, used light-weight technology prototyping components to explore the heavyweight idea of 'a harmonious intersection between tradition and technology, between natural materials, high craft and digital functionality'"Huh?Perhaps I'm missing something, but that description tells me next to nothing about the two wooden blocks, what they are for, what they do, or why I should even care.One of the author's design recommendations is "Focus On Core Functionality" (title of section 18.1.2 ). I fail to see how that is consistent with the idea of adding LCD picture frames (and other gadgets) to the exterior of a refrigerator, whose core functionality seems to me to be to keep food fresh and cold. Yet the author describes this appliance - the Whirlpool Centralpark - as a "successful user experience design".In reading this book, I kept asking myself if perhaps this ubiquitous computing thing is going a bit too far. Although he ignores this idea until the final chapter, the author seems to be having his own doubts as well. He confides that in order to write the book he "had to escape pervasive digital technology", by composing it in an anti-digital coffee shop, with no networking or electrical outlets.In conclusion, this is a book which would be of most interest to designers, and retired nerds (like myself). The author is very clever, with a breadth of knowledge about his subject area, and some interesting insights. I look forward to reading his future work, (especially if he reveals the secret of the cover chair).Disclosures:I did not pay for my copy of this book. As a member of the Amazon Vine program I received it for free.I have a long and varied background in software design, having worked on cell phones when the vast majority of the public did not know or care what they were (quite understandably, since at that time the handset was the size of a small lunch box). I moved on to other projects, until decades later, I found myself working again with these vastly improved gadgets (by then most everyone knew what they were, and indeed most everyone owned one). As a designer, I was drawn to this book after reading the preface which states it is primarily a tool for design practitioners.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,March 31, 2011,0123748992,Smart Things: Ubiquitous Computing User Experience Design,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123748992,Morgan Kaufmann,$45.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Great anti-inflammatory,I began using Zyflamend after reading about it on Dr. Andrew Weil's website. I suffer from an auto-immune disease (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis)and although the doctors are able to correct my hypothyroid with Synthroid, all the other symptoms of an auto-immune disorder persisted. I couldn't get through the day without taking up to six Ibuprofen, which were destroying my digestive system and (according to everything I've read, my liver). I began taking Zyflamend in October of 2009 and within a few days experienced relief from the variety of inflammation symptoms. As a number of other reviewers have mentioned, my chronic sinustis has been greatly improved and the pain in my back and hips is also diminished.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Useful, sturdy, accurate meter.,If you have read the excellent book "Understanding Wood" by Bruce Hoadley you know why you need a moisture meter.Wood expands or contracts depending on ambient moisture levels. Mr. Hoadley shows you how to calculate how much your wood will "move" in response to this, but to do so you must first know the initial moisture level in your wood. (The calculations are not complicated, by the way.)If you are installing siding, laying down a wood floor, building furniture, determining how much the wall height of your new log cabin will change, or simply verifying your toilet gasket is not leaking, a wood meter can help. Even construction carpenters can make use of thisgadget - for example to determine how much a newly framed building will shrink, which can be useful when applying siding, especially if it is more than a single story. The uses are limited only by your knowledge or wood, and your applications.I've owned the Delmhorst J-lite for about 2-1/2 years, and am very pleased with it. Although I use it less than I thought I would, most every time I do use it, it pays for itself all over again. For example, last year I installed $1,400 worth of pine board inside my house. Measuring the moisture of the existing interior wood, then comparingit to the moisture of the pine, it was easy to see that the pine would contract after installation (and using Hoadley's formula, to compute the magnitude of the changes - in this case the wood was more moist than the existing wood in my house, so I knew that it was going to shrink by about 1/16, so I took care to jamb the tongue and groove planks tightly together. Had the situation been the reverse, I would have left a slight gap between the planks.)Installing flooring, a moisture meter allows you know exactly when your wood planks have acclimated to the moisture in your home. There are many rules of thumb for this ranging from a few weeks to months, but this is unnecessary (and sometimes quite absurd) if your planks arrive at the correct moisture level to begin with.Back to the Delmhorst. What I like about it is:o it is sturdy, and well builto the readouts are reasonably simple and easy to understand.o the battery lasts a very long time.o comes with a spare set of pins, which I have not yet needed to use.o fits the hand well, comfortable.o comes in a nice blow molded plastic caseo provides a chart to correct for particular species and temperature, but this is typically not necessary unless you are a stickler for extreme accuracy.o can test more than just wood by giving a relative reading on plywood, OSB, MDF etc (that is to say the percentage reading may not be correct, but if you compare the OSB in your bathroom floor to another OSB sample it will show you which is wetter/dryer, which can be quite useful).The only negative that I can think of is that it requires a 9 volt battery. It could be a little more convenient if it took AA batteries.In conclusion, this is a well made meter, seems to give accurate and consistent results. It's usefulness depends on your willingness to learn about wood and it's reaction to moisture.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 23, 2009,B0000224D4,Delmhorst J-LITE 6% to 30% Pin LED Wood Moisture Meter,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000224D4,Delmhorst Instrument,$148.00

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Outstanding Out-of-Box Experience,Logitech has done a fine job in creating their new M325 wireless mouse. Although a bit expensive, it is likely to be considered "well worth it" to anyone who considers himself a true rodent connoisseur.Like most products today, the mouse is encased in a typical clear plastic package. I was pleasantly surprised to discover this package opens easily using just one's fingers - no knives, scissors or other sharp instruments are required (and no four letter words, either).Getting the mouse up and running is as quick and pleasant as the packaging. Pull the paper tab out of the mouse, plug the tiny USB receiver into the computer, and the mouse will be controlling the cursor within ten seconds or so. It's about as easy an installation as one could hope for. I suspect the reason it works this well is that the mouse runs off the default Microsoft Windows mouse driver, and not an exclusive Logitech one, thus avoiding a downloading step.The mouse performance is smooth and precise. It feels very good in the hand with slick plastic on top and rubber-like substance on the sides, and on the scroll wheel. The scroll wheel can be pressed left or right to activate back and forward in your browser. The scroll button has a very refined, precise feel when rotated - it feels like some sort of micro-detent mechanism (similar to a high quality, precision ratchet wrench, for those who are familiar with tools). However they did it, it's the most comfortable detent-based scroll wheel I've had the pleasure of experiencing.The optical tracking mechanism uses invisible light, which I think is a good thing (other, but not all, computer mice around the house use a visible red light, which I find distracting).While I love the idea of wireless mice, I have not had good luck with them to date. About 4 years ago I tried the Logitech V450 which I returned, after giving it a 2 star review. The Microsoft wireless mice are no better. My main objection is that they suffer from inconsistent response time, and there is often a distinct lag when the mouse is first moved after being at rest for awhile. I suspect the mouse enters a sleep mode, in order to conserve battery power. I am pleased to report that Logitech has considerably improved the lag time in this current mouse, to the extent that I barely perceive it, and find it quite acceptable for general use. (I must confess that I am very fussy about mouse performance, and more than a little bit spoiled as my desktop mouse is the terrific Logitech G500, a wired, programmable, laser-based device.)I really like the unifying receiver in this mouse. It is so tiny that it only protrudes about a quarter of an inch from the USB slot, making it quite practical to leave it permanently plugged in. I also like that idea that a single receiver can interface with up to six devices simultaneously (keyboards, other mice, etc), although I have not tested this, having no other unifying devices at present.As I mentioned, most people will just plug the receiver into their computer and leave it. However, for those who insist on unplugging, there is storage space on the bottom of the mouse, but you need to pop off the battery cover to access it.The range is very good. I was able to control my laptop from 33 feet away with no difficulty. It may work at even greater distances, but it was raining on the day of my test, and I did not want to go outdoors.I rate the build quality of the mouse as very good, and see no reason why most people would ever need to use the 3 year warranty.Logitech claims the battery will last about 18 months, but I have no way to verify that for you. There is an on-off switch on the bottom of the mouse, for those who really want to get the most mileage out of the single AA battery used by the device.I can tell you it works fine on my Windows XP laptop, and equally well on my wife's Windows 7 (64 bit) laptop.Unfortunately, this is where my review ends. After installing the mouse on her laptop my wife refuses to return it. This is quite a surprise to me, as she is been a die-hard fan, and obstinate user of 3 Microsoft wireless mice up until now.So, what's not to like? That's a tough question to answer. I suppose one could complain that the buttons are not programmable, or that it's not as responsive as a wired mouse (which might be of interest to hard-core gamers, and CAD users) but really I'm nit-picking here. Fact is, Logitech seems to have done just about everything right with this product.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mouse for everyday laptop computing.Disclosure: You should know that as an Amazon Vine reviewer, I did not pay for this mouse.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Cool, Cost effective, In the right application,Review of Lutron P-BDG-PKG1W Caseta Wireless Dimmer Kit with Smart BridgeFacts and Details about this Dimmer and Smart BridgeI am a big fan of Lutron dimmer switches. Over the years I have installed about 6 Maestro dimmers and occupancy sensors in my house, plus a few others in friend's homes. I was pleased to be able to sample this new line of internet connected switches as part of the Amazon Vine program.The Smart Bridge (Updated Nov 26, 2014):I was unable to load the Lutro Caseta App when I did my initial review. Lutron has since issued an updated app that fixes this problem (caused apparently by the Apple iOS V8.1.1 update).The smart bridge app allows control of one or more dimmer switches via one's phone or tablet.A very handy feature is turning lights on/off based on sunrise and sunset times. I currently use a simple timer to turn my outdoor lights on, but have to reprogram the time 4 or 5 times during the year as the daylight hours change. The Smart Bridge has a better way. Allow the app to access your location (because sunrise/sunset varies depending on where you live) and you never have to program the on/off times again.You aren't stuck with choosing simply sunset as the on time. The app lets you do this up to 2 hours before or after sunset. Ditto for sunrise.When exactly is sunrise/sunset? It seems that the app uses the same times as the built-in weather app in my iPhone.The app is fairly easy to use, and intuitive. It does have a few "rough edges": it uses pop up dialogs where a more subtle interaction would suffice, it runs only in portrait mode, there is no iPad specific mode (it looks like a super-sized iPhone app), but everything does work, and I expect it will improve steadily as time goes on.I was curious to see how robust this system is, and learn where the "brains" actually reside. Once you program your devices, will they still work if the internet is down? The answer is, happily, Yes! Internet connectivity is not required for timed on/off events to work. The "brains" seem to reside in the smart bridge. If the bridge loses power, and a timed event occurs before power is restored, the associated switches and dimmers miss the event. This isn't really so bad, because presumably if the smart bridge is without power, so is the rest of your house.Another test I performed was to momentarily interrupt power to the smart bridge for 1 minute, and then restore it, simulating a brief power outage. In this case, the smart bridge *misses* the next timed event, even if that event occurs many minutes after power is restored. After this first missed event, things start working again, and all subsequent events trigger as you would expect. This seems to be a minor bug, which I expect the Lutron developers will correct eventually.When you are away from home the app lets you see what your dimmer switches are doing. It will tell you if they are off or on. And if on, it will tell you the brightness level they are set to (as a percent). It's kind of cool to be able to know if anyone at home is using the lights. Lutron has been making Maestro occupancy sensors for years, and so it seems inevitable that they will soon come out with Caseta versions. This could give the app the information it needs to warn you that someone is in your house. But we will have to wait and see on this.I was out walking my dogs, miles away from home, and just for fun pulled out my iPhone and turned the light on to 75% brightness. Sure enough, when I arrived home the light was on, as I had requested. This is very cool, and possibly even useful in some circumstances.The smart bridge also claims to be able to control electric window shades and certain Honeywell thermostats. However I do not own any of these products and so am unable to test this feature.The bridge is a small white plastic rectangle, 1-3/16" high by 2-3/4" wide by 2-3/4" deep. The back side of the cube has three items: a micro USB connection, an ethernet connection, and an undocumented switch (presumably a reset button).I was curious about what the cost of powering this gadget would be over the course of a year. The cube states its power draw is 300 mA at 5 V, which works out to 1.5 watts. I measured the 120V amperage using two different meters, averaged the readings, and came up with 0.9 watts. This works out to an annual electrical cost of $1.00 to $1.70 per year (assuming $0.13 per kw-hr, the US average). Presumably users will easily be able to recoup this energy cost by using the smart features of this device.When powered, the cube emits a white glow via thin LEDs on three of its four sides. Without the app I cannot determine yet if there is a way to disable this potentially annoying light.The smart bridge comes complete with all necessary cables. The power supply is a white plastic case about 2-3/8" wide, 1" high that protrudes 1-1/2" out from the wall socket. It is rated at 1000 mA at 5 V (5 watts). It has a 72" long cable terminating in a micro USB connector that plugs into the smart bridge cube. The 36" long ethernet cable connects your router to the cube.========= Update: Dec 17, 2014 ===============================================I was asked a question about device control when the internet provider's modem goes down. Since I now have both the Belkin WeMo Maker and the Lutron Caseta system I decided to test and compare both of them in various scenarios, to see if they can be controlled via an iPhone. Here is what I discovered:TEST............................................................................Belkin WeMo............Lutron Caseta---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Unplug ethernet between Smart Bridge and router............N/A..........................NO2. No AC power to Modem & router.....................................NO...........................NO3. No internet connection (Modem & router powered)...........YES..........................NOA YES in the table above indicates the device can be controlled from my iPhone.My cable modem & router are integrated into a single device, so am unable to power these down separately.Both the Lutron dimmer, and the Belkin WeMo can be controlled locally (via their hardware switches) during any of the tests above.The WeMo may be a preferred choice if your application requires phone or tablet control in absence of an internet connection.===========================================================================The Caseta Dimmer & Pico Remote Controller:Caseta dimmers are a stand-alone product that may be purchased and used without the smart bridge and its associated app. They work with pretty much everything you would reasonably expect including LEDs, CFLs, Halogens and other incandescents. Note that LEDs and CFLs must be "dimmer capable" in order to work.Caseta's have abandoned the elegant interface of the Maestro dimmers. The large single button has morphed into 4 smaller buttons - On, Off, Dim Up and Dim Down. I like the original design better. However human-machine interfaces are highly subjective, and perhaps I am in the minority.The remote has shrunk losing considerable bulk and weight, but still has the same number of switches as the previous model (5). The buttons are the same as found on the Caseta dimmer, with the addition of a round "favorite" button. It has been upgraded to a wireless signal, rather than the original's IR (infrared) beam. That means you can operate the dimmer even from another room, or outside your house. I think the remote is an improvement over the original design .Lutron claims the Pico remote will operate for 10 years before needing a fresh battery. I'll take their word on that since even my old remote has never needed a new battery during all it's years of service (about 6 years and counting).The Pico remote has an impressive operating 350 foot range based on a simple test I performed.If you are interested in the details of my test, read on: I installed the dimmer into a plastic electrical box with a light bulb socket and extension cord. I plugged it into an exterior socket on my porch, hung it from a rafter so I could see the bulb light up, and proceeded down the street counting paces as I went. I found I was able to operate the switch reliably for up to 140 paces (which works out to 350 feet).The Pico remote is very small, but not too small. It's 2-5/8" high, 1-1/4" wide, and 3/8" thick. It will fit perfectly in any standard Decora wall plate (which is very convenient if you want to stick it on your wall and have it appear to be a regular switch). If you are a stickler for accuracy, I hereby confess that it is actually a tiny bit wider and a tiny bit thinner than stated, by about 1/16".If you have ever wired two switches to control the same light, you will greatly appreciate the simplicity of using the Caseta and it's Pico remote to do the same job - especially as it allows one to avoid renovating existing house wiring. The savings in wiring and time can easily justify the cost of the Caseta / Pico combination (you can mount the Pico in numerous ways, including in the wall like a standard switch, using an optional bracket).The remote can be paired with more than one dimmer switch. That's a very powerful feature which could also be highly cost effective in certain scenarios. For example, my outdoor lights are controlled by three separate switches, located in different locations. I would prefer to have all lights controlled by a single switch, dimmable, and turn on and off automatically (on at sunset, off at 11:00 pm). To do this with traditional switches would require pulling a lot of wire, and wiring in photocells and timers to do the job. It could also be done using three Caseta dimmers, a single Pico remote (to control all three manually), and the smart bridge to do the sunrise automatic timer function. It would cost a homeowner about three hundred dollars to buy the necessary Lutron switches and smart bridge (at this time). Now consider how much you would pay to buy the wire and fittings to do it the traditional way. Even assuming you can do all this yourself you might not save much using traditional wiring. If you needed to hire an electrician I bet you'd be many hundreds of dollars ahead using the Lutron gear.For more comprehensive information about these gadgets one can go to the Lutron website named casetawireless.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Good Discount Bits,I bought this bit set a few years ago for those rare occasions when I need a bit that's a little longer than normal (pocket holes, etc.). I have used them a few dozen times, only in wood (hard and soft), and mostly in a hand held electric drill - I have been pleased with the results.These are not the highest quality drill bits you can buy, but they are good enough for average work. Considering you get 13 bits for about the price of one or (maybe) two high quality ones, I think these are a pretty good deal.Regarding flexing, I don't think it's possible to make a thin, long bit that won't flex a little, and many of the bits in this set are thin. Whenever possible I try to drill a pilot hole using a standard size bit, and then use the 6" bit for the remaining depth. This seems to minimize the flexing problem.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 16, 2006,B0000DD0PS,Grizzly G9750 Aircraft Extension Dril Length 13-Piece Set, 1/16-Inch, 1/4-Inch by 6-Inch Long,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DD0PS,Grizzly,$17.75

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,12L14 Steel Cuts Like Butter on my Taig Lathe,Review of 12L14 Steel Hex Bar, 1-1/2" Across Flats, 36" LengthIt feels odd to find myself reviewing a chunk of metal (as the REM song says: "I never thought life would be this strange....")The short review follows:This 12L14 piece was very heavy, long (1.5" diameter x 3 feet). It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.Note that it is lightly covered with oil or some other sort of rust protector which is easily cleaned of with your favorite solvent (I prefer rubbing alcohol as it is relatively easy on one's skin, and does not stink).End of short review.Long-winded review follows:I bought a Taig metal lathe a few years ago, and have used it for a variety of small, simple projects. I find that in some cases Hexagonal stock is preferable to round: it locates in the chuck very securely and can be accurately re-chucked (by marking one face and one jaw); it's easy to turn the flat edges off to produce a cylinder (which is obviously what one intends with a lathe); the flat faces make it easier to secure the piece (in say a vise) for filing, cutting and further processing.No material is perfect, there are always trade-offs in the properties of each. That being said, I am finding that 12L14 steel is wonderful stuff to machine on a lathe - it cuts like butter, (a slight exaggeration, as I've never actually worked butter in my lathe). I often work it without using any cutting oil whatsoever, especially if I'm not removing much material.I have read that it does not solder or braze well, and that it may be more prone to rusting. I have not tried to braze or solder it and so cannot comment from experience. In my shop I haven't noticed that it seems to be more prone to rust than any other steel, but your mileage may vary.I've ordered quite a few pieces of metal from Small Parts and have been very happy with their service. As far as I can tell the metal is as advertised (e.g. the type, specifications, etc.). The pieces are usually packaged very securely ensuring the metal arrives in good condition (and most importantly for smaller diameters - not bent). Shipping is also very fast for me, being an amazon prime member.Should the reader be one of those rare, unusual people with a lust for 12L14 steel, I highly recommend this item.End of long-winded review.Happy machining.Regards,Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 18, 2013,B003ZHUUX2,12L14 Steel Hex Bar, Unpolished (Mill) Finish, ASTM A108 1-1/2" Across Flats, 36" Length,Industrial & Scientific,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZHUUX2,Small Parts,$57.36
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,A Superior Quality Case for Kindle Fir 8.9",Review of: Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9" Standing Leather Case, Onyx BlackSummary:This is a very attractive, high quality case that makes the Kindle Fire 8.9" more convenient to use.Initially I was going to give it four stars, which means "very good", in part because I thought it was a bit pricey at about fifty bucks. However, a few days ago I had the opportunity to use an even more expensive case (on an Apple product) for a few days. That experience compelled my to give a full five stars to this superior amazon-designed product.Pros:It is packaged very well (as promised). Open the box, slide it out of it's plastic bag, insert the Kindle, and it's working. No knives, scissors or other tools required. Most, if not all the packaging is recyclable.Fit's the kindle fire 8.9" perfectly.Automatically wakes up the kindle when the cover is opened. This is a wonderful feature - I like it a lot more than I thought I would.All kindle ports, buttons and speakers are accessible and functional. There is one very slight issue - see the Cons list below.Makes the Kindle significantly more pleasant, and more convenient to use.Works fine as a stand when used on a table or desk. Does not work so well if it's just sitting on ones lap (it would need a half-height backer for this, I think).Very high quality design, build and materials.Cons:Some headphone jacks may not fit quite as snugly as without the case. All jacks I've tried have worked though, so this is a very minor complaint given all the good points about this case.Disclosure:I received this product for free in exchange for posting a review.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Nice Wiper, Fits Honda CRV,This Trico (17-200) is a perfect fit in the passenger side of my 2006 Honda CRV (original factory blade bracket).If you are measuring your brackets, you should note that this blade is shorter than the 20 inches stated in the description. It's actually about half an inch shorter, being 19.5 rather than 20 inches. Based on my experiences with two different sizes of these blades, it seems that they are all about one half inch shorter than promised.These are good quality blades, although I cannot comment on long term durability.The blades are nicely packaged, easy to open without tools or scissors or other pointy objects, and include refreshingly clear instructions (both for removal of old blade and installation of the new one).Other thoughts:If you are looking to buy a blade for the driver's side of a 2006 CRV, be aware that the amazon and Trico databases are in error at the time of this review (see my review of the Trico 17-210 for particulars).One detail that may be useful to those measuring their own blades: these Trico's fit in 6 mm wide slots (that is, the blade, measured across the steel side pieces, measures 6 mm which is just a hair under one quarter of an inch).My rating is based on the blade quality, (I am ignoring the unfortunate database errors and the half inch length issue, in hopes it will be corrected at some point).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 12, 2012,B000CRMNLU,Trico 17-200 Teflon Blade Refill designed to fit Trico Teflon blades only-20" (1 refill),Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRMNLU,Trico,$5.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,I am Sticking With These!,Review of Slipstick CB827 3-1/4-Inch Gripper Foot, ChocolateWe recently ripped out our carpet and installed Birch wood flooring. There is a saying that every solution creates a new problem. In this case we noticed our huge, heavy couch was moving, ... a lot. Had to reposition it every other day, despite trying to be careful not to flop down on it or push off while getting up.I read the favorable reviews about this product, and decided to give it a try. It's been about two months and the couch has not budged. These are very effective grippers. They are reasonably well made, include screws for fastening, and are easy to install. It's possible to simply stick these on, if you don't want the hassle of drilling a few tiny holes, but I chose to use screws.After a few weeks with no movement whatsoever, I was so impressed I purchased a second set for our other couch, and a huge assortment set for various other smaller pieces of furniture. Great results with all this stuff as well.If you need to keep furniture from moving about on smooth surfaces, you may wish to consider this product. It is a bit expensive for what it is, but one the other hand quite effective, at least on my wood flooring.Thanks to all the other reviewers who posted your impressions of this product!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 28, 2014,B002CGRVKC,Slisptick CB827 3-1/4" Furniture Floor Protector Gripper Foot / Pad (set of 4) Chocolate Color,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CGRVKC,Slipstick,$9.96
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,good tool,It takes a little fiddling to adjust the double blades so that the follower takes just a tiny bit more wood than the front one does. Once adjusted it works as advertised - it puts a reasonably smooth edge on your wood. Does not work as well on end grain, but that would be expected of any power or hand tool.I use it to quickly "break the edge" of things like shelves, boxes, etc.I have used a router with a comparable size rounding bit (1/16 I think) and must say that this plane leaves an edge that is about as good as the router, without the time and hassle of changing bits, adjusting fences, etc.Whichever method I use, I follow up with a quick, light sanding, but that's mostly because I'm fussy.Considering the price of this tool is less than a router bit, I think it's well worth the cost.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,February 7, 2006,B0000DD0TK,Woodstock W1100 Slickplane,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DD0TK,WOODSTOCK,$14.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,2,Nice idea, but I had problems,Pros: o small size. In it's minimal configuration - with the thumb rest removed - it is 5-1/2" tall, 1" wide, and 1-1/4" deep. With a bit installed it is still only 1-3/4" deep. o all metal construction. o magnetic bit holder grips bits securely. o customer support is responsive (less than 2 minutes waiting on telephone) and friendly.Cons: o reliability / build-quality issues. The item I purchased was defective (see notes below). o it takes two hands to use this attachment, one to hold the screwdriver and one to hold the tool. Compare this to a lightweight angle drill/driver which takes just one hand. For the most part, this makes the tool useful only in very tight situations where an angle drill will not fit.Notes:The item I received is defective. The bit spins freely in both directions under no load, but doesn't run in reverse (counter-clockwise) under even light pressure (ie attempting to remove a #8-1" wood screw). It does work fine running clockwise, driving the same screw into a wood block.The helpful person I spoke with at customer service said he suspected that a tooth was broken. He advised me to return the item and purchase the heavier duty 49-22-8510. I'm not sure if I'll do that since that item is somewhat larger (2" deep) making it less useful for tight spaces. Also, I own many tools (Makita, Bosch, Dewalt, etc) and it is extremely rare to get one that is broken right out of the box. Since this is my first Milwaukee tool, it makes me leery of the quality of this brand.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 17, 2007,B0000224AW,Milwaukee 48-32-2100 OFF-SET Power Screwdriver Head,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000224AW,Milwaukee,$24.63

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Works Fine with my Fein MM 350Q,Ive been using this sharp, aggressive blade on my Fein MM 350Q. It fits perfectly, but because its uses Boschs OIS system, it only mounts in 90 degree increments. If you need more angles, consider purchasing the Bosch OIS001 adapter, and you will be able to mount it in 30 degree increments.This blade is thicker than my other Fein metal and wood blades, probably due to accommodate the carbide teeth. The wider kerf often does not matter, but when it does one needs to fall back to using a non-carbide blade. The extra thickness is a reasonable trade-off, considering this blade can handle surprise encounters with metal much better than other blades.This blade cuts wood very well, but its not quite as smooth or fast cutting as dedicated wood blades. I presume thats also a tradeoff resulting from the nature of carbide or extra thickness.The blade seems more rigid than others. Depending on what you are using it for, this can be either a good or bad thing. In my work, its usually a plus.I havent worn this out yet - not even close. Its very durable and easily worth the additional cost over non-carbide blades.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 7, 2015,B00ELC9R9S,Bosch OSC114C 1-1/4-Inch Multi-Tool Carbide Tooth Plunge Cut Blade,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ELC9R9S,Bosch,$15.55
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Would you like a Pencil with your Paper?,Review of Pencil by 53Summary Version:If you are a fan of the iPad app Paper by 53 (and they are legion), then you may wish to seriously consider this stylus. You get an exclusive bonus feature enabled in the app in the form of a Blending tool, plus it unlocks the entire tool set, potentially saving you about ten bucks off the price of the app. The electronics give you an eraser at the end of the stylus and palm rejection (imperfect, but good enough for some). Build quality is very high, it has a pleasant, well balanced feel in the hand. Unfortunately this stylus is no more precise than your finger - something which can be said about most other stylus offerings to date (and perhaps all).Long Version (you've been warned!):I decided to review this Pencil by 53 stylus because I was skeptical of its utility, and curious as to why anyone would pay so much when there are many less costly alternatives. (Note that I did not pay for this - amazon provided it to me for free in exchange for reviewing it.) I also believe it is healthy to challenge ones prejudices and assumptions from time to time. I have used this for about a week, so do not have any factual information for you about the long term durability of this gadget - that being said it seems to be very sturdy and well built, so I expect it to last a long time. With those disclaimers out of the way, let the review begin!The fiftythree website says their stylus was inspired by the carpenter pencil, used by builders and makers for centuries. While I admire the marketing genius of invoking romantic, nostalgic feelings about this new product, I cannot help but wonder if there is some hidden truth here are well. I happen to be intimately familiar with real carpenter pencils. I use them frequently when doing rough carpentry work, stuff that does not require much accuracy, but for everything else I choose a different, finer writing device. Perhaps 53 is quietly acknowledging the accuracy of this stylus is about the same as using your finger (as is the case with most or all other stylus brands today).Some Details:o I am reviewing the black Graphite Pencil, made of brushed aluminum. It does not have the magnetic snap feature that the wooden one does, so I shall not comment on that feature.o The stylus comes well packaged in a 1-1/2&#34; diameter by 6-1/4&#34; high sturdy cardboard tube.o There is a 1 year warranty, and a 30 day return policy.o In addition to the typical safety-related boilerplate that plagues all products these days, there are a few amusing words of advice. For instance you should never use Pencil while taking a bath! You should not eat this pencil, or it's battery. If you do, seek medical advice immediately. Good stuff here!o The electronic-based magic of Pencil is compatible only with full sized iPad generations 3, 4 and 5 (Air). Both iPad mini models are supported (i.e. generation 1 & 2).o You are advised to disable / turn-off the iPad's recognition of multitasking gestures and accessibility zoom.This is no great loss, as these things cause problems with other drawing apps as well.o This stylus is not pressure sensitive. It senses pressure as On or Off (i.e. touching or not touching the screen), with no graduations in between. So you will not be able to press harder for darker or thicker lines, for example. Of course, it's possible there is a gradient sensor in the device but the software in the Paper app chooses not to take advantage of it, only 53 knows for sure...This is a well designed, high quality stylus. There is a lot more good about it than bad, so let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.The Bad:o The cool electronics-based features of this stylus only work with the Paper app by 53 at this time (i.e. eraser, palm rejection). It will however work fine as a normal stylus with any app.o There is no storage case per se. Perhaps it is expected that one will use the high quality cardboard cylinder that the product is packaged in (that's what I've been doing).o Palm rejection - the holy grail of many stylus users - is imperfect. My understanding is that no stylus maker has yet achieved perfection in this area, and 53 is no exception. To be clear, 53 has done such a good job implementing this feature that I thought it worked perfectly for the first while, until eventually noticing two kinds of glitches.sometimes when writing text the character last written would disappear, to be lost forever (i.e. undo would not bring the strokes back). I believe this was the palm rejection algorithm deciding the strokes were illegitimate and hence wiping them from the drawing stack.sometimes small strokes would appear on the screen underneath the place where my hand was resting. I could live with this if the Paper app supported layers, as one could manage the amount of damage to the image by simply using lots of them. Unfortunately Paper has but a single layer, and the undo mechanism doesn't help much because one doesn't notice the artifacts for some time, as they are covered by one's hand - to undo an artifact one often has to toss a lot of valid strokes.The Good:o Packaging is very impressive, and commensurate with a high quality device. Instructions were clear and concise for initial setup. Battery is partially charged so the device is useable right out of the box (although I charged mine up before using it, as the instructions suggested). For full documentation, also very well done, go to the 53 website.o Battery life is up to 1 month on a single charge based on &#34;normal&#34; use. I have not used Pencil long enough to require a recharge, but can say the battery still reads full, even after many days of use. A full charge requires 90 minutes, but partial charges are fine and will not harm the device.o Charges on any standard USB port, including your iPad's charger. So no extra gear required above and beyond what you need for your tablet.o Feels great in the hand. The aluminum version has a pleasant textured, slightly rubber-like feel. It is a bit on the hefty side, which for me is a plus. On my kitchen scale it weighs in at about 35 gm. The rectangular stylus is about 5-1/2&#34; long by 5/8&#34; wide by 5/16&#34; high. Nice proportions for my medium sized hands, and I suspect it would be comfortable for smaller as well as larger handed folks.o Feels great on the screen. The rubberized tip has just the right amount of friction as it is dragged across the glass, slightly more than a mechanical pencil dragging across a piece of paper. I found it easy and intuitive to control.o Firmware in Pencil can be updated via the Paper app. A potentially great feature, as it leaves open the possibility of maintaining compatibility of the device despite future design changes by Apple. It also leaves me hoping that Palm Rejection might be improved.o All tools and features are enabled in the Paper app for free by virtue of using the Pencil. This potentially saves one about $10 - download the Paper app for free, link it to Pencil, and everything is automatically enabled. (Note that if you stop using Pencil with the app, these bonus features disappear after 30 days).o Pencil users have the exclusive privilege of using a feature unavailable to pencil-less Paper users, Blending by Finger (also commonly called a Smudge feature in other apps). This is a mixed bag. While it offers a useful new feature, I found that smudging often occurred when I did not want it to. Failing to press the stylus hard enough against the screen often resulted in a smudge, rather than a tool action. I suspect the reason for this is the sensor in the tip did not &#34;know&#34; the stylus was touching the screen and interpreted the capacitance as coming from a finger. Same problem occurs with the eraser. If this bugs you, the finger-smudge feature can be disabled. Or, you can train yourself to simply press a tiny bit harder when drawing. If you do this you may come to see this bug as a feature, allowing you to use the Pencil for both smudging and drawing. Either way, you are in control here, so I have rated this as a positive rather than a negative feature.o Battery charge level is displayed in the Paper app. Its always good to know how full the tank is.o The eraser on the top end of the stylus is cool. You really don't need it, as there is of course a tool which when activated makes the stylus tip act like an eraser. However, it is quicker and more intuitive to flip the pencil over and rub the eraser on the drawing to make stuff go away. Feels just like a Pencil!o Avoid screen protectors. I am delighted to see 53 recommend against using a screen protector with this stylus because it dramatically increases wear on tips, and interferes with touch detection. There is much misinformation and confusion about screen protectors and stylus use. Its refreshing to see 53 state their opinion clearly and unequivocally.o Pencil comes with spare parts, an extra rubber nib for each end, and clear instructions for installation.The Pencil AppSince Pencil is intimately tied to the Paper app, I think it's fair to mention a few observations about Paper that may help you decide if this Pencil-and-Paper combo is for you.On the plus side, Paper is a brilliantly designed and implemented app, whose prime directive seems to be replicating the artistic experience of drawing on paper in the most pure, most simple, manner possible. Beneath the apparent simplicity are very deep, subtle capabilities that allow advanced users to do extraordinary things. The color mixer is very impressive, as are other seemingly simple tools, once you know how to exploit their capabilities. See sebastiansdrawings website and download his free 62 page PDF &#34;cheat sheets&#34; for some excellent insights into the power of Paper.On the minus side, Paper's designer are perhaps too fervent about maintaining the purity of the drawing on paper paradigm. This may explain why the app does not provide important, time saving features such as layers, image import (for backgrounds), portrait mode (the app only works in landscape mode), and others. Some of the capabilities are relatively easy to implement, and given the great sophistication of the Paper app I can only conclude these have been left out on purpose. These omissions are so significant to the way I work, that Paper is not my drawing app of choice, despite my deep admiration for it.For the vast population of ardent Paper users, I expect this seductive stylus will be an irresistible, useful enhancement to your drawing pleasure and productivity.Thanks for reading.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 28, 2014,B00JP12170,Pencil by FiftyThree Digital Stylus for iPad and iPhone - Graphite,Amazon.com,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JP12170,FiftyThree,$49.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,nice clamp - better than average,I bought this clamp about 10 months ago. It is well made, easy to use, and very handy. Construction is more robust than other clamps of this nature such as Irwin Quick clamps, and it is only slightly heavier with somewhat greater clamping pressure.I own many different brands and kinds of clamps and I've learned that there is no perfect clamp. Each has it's trade-offs.This clamp is quick, one-handed, and will generally not mark or damage your work. It is great for holding things down while you drill, sand, saw or otherwise work on them. It's probably one of the most often used clamps in my shop.If you are intending to glue-up items such as boxes, drawers, or cabinets, I suggest you purchase a few square-clamping cabinet clamps which are available from Bessey, Jorgensen, and others.Also, stay open to other types of clamps that may offer advantages in difficult circumstances. Bessey KliKlamps are lightweight, and fit into spaces where others will not. They can be handy on ladders or in tight spaces. But they are not one-handed, which in some cases is a show-stopper.Back to the Jorgenson ISD.This is a wonderful clamp, very handy, quality build. I used to prefer my Irwin Quick clamps, but now when I need a one-handed clamp I find I reach for the Jorgensen ISD first.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 5, 2007,B0009WG5U8,Jorgensen 33006 6-Inch One-Handed ISD Bar Clamp,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009WG5U8,Jorgensen,$17.10
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,good tool,I have had better luck with this plane than the other reviewer (who gave it a single star). It takes a little fiddling to adjust the double blades so that the follower takes just a tiny bit more wood than the front one does. Once adjusted it works as advertised - it puts a reasonably smooth edge on your wood. Does not work as well on end grain, but that would be expected of any cutting power or hand tool.I use it to quickly "break the edge" of things like shelves, boxes, etc.I have used a router with a comparable size rounding bit (1/16 I think) and must say that this plane leaves an edge that is about as good as the router, without the time and hassle of changing bits, adjusting fences, etc.Whichever method I use, I follow up with a quick, light sanding, but that's mostly because I'm fussy.Considering the price of this tool is less than a router bit, I think it's well worth the cost.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,February 4, 2006,B0000DD0TT,Woodstock W1101 1/8-Inch Radius Slickplane Replacement Blades, Pair,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DD0TT,WOODSTOCK,$14.19
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Things I Love and Hate about this Dyson Vacuum,This is a good to very good vacuum.Pros:- good power- very good attachments- very good power head- good ergonomics- very good reach- very good cleaning ability- no need to buy bagsCons:- tiny holding bin is messy and unpleasant to empty- somewhat heavy- somewhat noisy- poor instructionsIf you value the bagless feature more than you despise the messy of bin changes you will probably be very satisfied with this vacuum.--------------------------------------------Some additional details about this product.I used this Dyson to clean hardwood and vinyl floors, throw rugs, wall-to-wall carpet, walls and vaulted wood ceiling, stairs, computer keyboards and desks, and a compact SUV.Scant documentation comes with the machine - just basic setup information, and some icon-based illustrations. Nothing identifies the numerous attachments or their purpose. You need the internet to figure this thing out. When I attempted to view the introductory video the web site generated an error. Also, the site does not work with iPads, so youll need to use a PC to learn about this product. Lets hope Dyson fixes their website soon.Suction is very good. Noise level, while loud, was not too unpleasant. However, I own other vacuums that are quieter, even though they have similar power. If noise is important to you, there may be better options available.The cleaner head works very well on carpet. It did an impressive job removing dust and debris from auto mats laid out on the driveway. It did a good job cleaning wood floors with the brush rotator turned off. Overall this is a better power head than any other vacuum I have used.When the head inevitably clogs up with a wind of carpet thread or dog hair, its easy to clean. If things get really bad, there are two red flippy tabs than open the head up and expose more of the roller brush.The power cord is a generous 35 feet long. The high quality cord wraps around the handle for storage.The maximum comfortable hose extension is about 12.5 feet. The Instant Release Wand extension adds another 2.5 feet for a total reach of 15 feet (this works with all attachments). Connect the Flexible Extender and gain another 2 feet for a total reach of 17 feet.Build quality and feel is a mixed bag. Most parts of the machine seem to be high quality. However the body parts seem to be loosely fitted, bendy plastic. Perhaps the loose fitting bendy parts make the device more durable. When standing upright it seems a bit wobbly and unstable, but in use it was not prone to tipping over, even with the hose extended. Taking the machine out of stand up mode generates a snapping sound which has a cheap &#34;this-is-about-to-break-the-plastic&#34; kind of feeling. But it never did break, and I soon got used to it and stopped worrying. The Ball technology, which allows the device to twist and swivel works fine. It takes a little getting used to, but with time it seems to be an improvement over more rigid, traditional machines.This is a somewhat heavy beast (or Animal). Certainly heavier than what I am used to (my other vacuums are many pounds lighter). However once I learned how to most efficiently use it and carry it, I did not find this to be a serious problem.I am impressed with the performance and usefulness of the attachments.Here is whats included:- Instant Release Wand. This is a clever tube that lives inside the flexible extension hose. Its quick and easy to uncouple it from the machine. Click on an attachment, extend it as necessary, and go to work. With just this wand and any attachment, I could reach within about 6 inches of the highest spot on my 11.25 foot vaulted ceiling, while standing comfortably on the floor. By adding the narrow flexible extender, I could reach the highest spot with room to spare. (Note that this vertical reaching depends on your height - I am a few inches short of 6 feet - your mileage will vary. You can reach even further going horizontally, when not limited by your own reach - see specifications below). For me this vertical reach is important because it allows quick and easy removal of cobwebs, and dust from clerestory windows, without hauling out a step ladder as my other vacuums require.- Flexible Extender (aka Flexi Crevice Tool). Another impressive tool. This is narrow for getting into tight spots. Its a little over a foot long. Press a button on the side and it extends to about 2 feet and reveals a flexible, rubber-like tube. Because of its smaller size, only the Reach Under Tool, and a Tiny Brush can attach to it. The flexible extender itself attaches, to the instant release wand - but you already knew that didnt you?- Reach under tool. Fits onto the flexible extender, looks like a crevice tool with fuzzy stuff on the side. It sucks from the fuzzy side and the end. Works pretty well getting under (or beside) the fridge, stove, shelves and other tight spots. The great thing about these tight spots as cannot really see if you got all the dirt - I just tell myself its clean and feel good about that. Dyson makes no mention of this, but I found the Reach Under tool was did an excellent job cleaning computer keyboards - better than anything else Ive ever used!- Tiny brush. Fits onto the flexible extender. Works like tiny brush on a vacuum - just like you would expect.- Multi-angle brush. This reminds me of the U-shaped water trap under the sink, only its clear, with a brush and dust-pad, and each end swivels 360 degrees. All this twisty-ness makes it possible to clean the tops of narrow shelves, window sills, and trim, especially stuff above your head. It worked very well cleaning my clerestory window sills, door tops, and some narrow shelving. Saves getting out the ladder or a step stool. I like it!- Mattress tool. A medium-sized T-shaped pickup too. I confess, I didnt try it on a mattress, where Im sure it will work as well or better than traditional attachments. I did use it on furniture and it works fine. Nothing earth shattering here, but nothing wrong with it either.- Carbon fiber soft dusting brush. As recommended by Dyson, I used this to dust a table top, and a lamp shade. It actually worked very well. I was so inspired I dusted my computer desk, my computer, some speakers, bookshelves (even the books). Sometimes it takes more than one pass to get up all the dust, and you do have to keep the fibers clean, but this is a fairly handy tool. In hindsight, its really just as easy to dust a table top using a damp cloth, but this seems a bit quicker and more fun (at least until the novelty wears off). Maybe Dyson needs to come up with shorter names for these things?- Tangle-free Turbine tool. A mini-powerhead with two rotating brushes that rotate sideways compared to a standard power head. Its powered by the air pressure from the vacuum, and small enough to be operated with one hand. I found it did a good job removing pet hair from auto upholstery, and a very good job on carpeted stairs (which were also inundated with red dog hair). Dyson claims the brushes wont clog with tangled hair as traditional power heads do. In my testing I did have to remove some hair manually from the brushes, but is was really easy and quick to do. Be warned - on auto upholstery it may leave swirly marks which you then have to rub-out (not a big deal, at least on my car).- Crevice Tool with integrated brush. This is a classic crevice tool, with a brush wrapped around it. The brush moves forward and clicks in place ready for use as a brush tool. Slide it back and youve got a standard crevice tool. Initially impressed with this clever design, I soon learned its got a big drawback. It just doesnt work in most crevices because the permanently attached brush gets in the way. It would be much better to just have two tools: a brush and a simple crevice tool. Nice try Dyson, but it just isnt practical. On the bright side, Dyson will sell you a plain crevice tool for a reasonable price, if you really must have it all.- Accessory tool bag. All these tools cry out for some kind of storage, and Dyson Cinetic Science delivers . a bag. Yup, you read that right - just a black nylon bag with a strap and few square pockets on the outside. It works, but nothing impressive here. Its unclear which tools should go into the pockets - many dont fit very well, so I keep most of the stuff jumbled together in the bag. This storage system is kind of a let down.The hygienic bin is the best thing about this vacuum. And the worst thing. It all depends on your perspective. The good news is you never, ever need to buy vacuum bags. Think of all the money you may save!The bad news is you may need to buy N95 respirator masks, especially if you suffer from asthma or allergies. Emptying this bin is anything but hygienic. Its a dirty, messy, unpleasant task. Dyson suggests encasing the bin in a plastic bag during discharge. This helps, but not enough. You still must endure a plume of nasty dust when you withdraw the bag. And more dust as you clean off the flipper door. And even more when you clean the bin with water (Dyson says this water-based step is optional, but if you dont do it the clear plastic canister will always look dusty and dirty).There is more bad news. The dust bin is very small - a tiny fraction the size of a typical vacuum bag. It doesnt take long for it to reach the full mark, especially if there is much dog hair in the mix. I found myself repeating this unpleasant task much more often than I cared to. Personally, Id rather buy vacuum bags.When the time comes to use one of the many attachments, a pleasant surprise awaits you. Nestled in the handle is a 22 slinky hose that expands magically to over 12 feet long. It allows you to rapidly switch from floor sweeping, to cobweb or dust removal on the ceiling overhead. It allows you to park your Dyson at the foot of a staircase and vacuum every stair up to the second floor (13 foot span). This is a great feature overall, and I like it a lot.But its not perfect. It is built like a long gentle spring, so it pulls back on your hand when its extended. This is not too noticeable for short spans. However, fully extended it pulls with about 2.6 pounds of force. Thats with the vacuum turned off. Turn it on, and the suction adds even more pull-back force. The worst case I measured had a total pull-back force of 4.1 pounds (hose fully extended while using the reach under tool). More typical situations are less severe. With the hose moderately extended pullback varies from 0.6 to 1.6 pounds depending on the tool in use (pullback is related to orifice size of the tool).You may not notice the hose pull too much when doing quick jobs. Long jobs - like car cleaning - become tiring unless the vacuum is close by. Even with the pull-back, I still like this feature a lot. It's a small price to pay for the great convenience this clever extensible hose adds to your vacuuming pleasure.The stated weight is 19.2 pounds, but I found it to be lighter than this - 17.6 pounds.Dimensions (HWD) are 43.3 x 13.4 x 17.2 inches.Suction Power is 180AW (Air Watts). If youre curious, look up Air Watts on wikipedia. Itll make you a better person.Dyson says bin volume is 0.57 gallons, but the useable volume is less - I calculated 0.34 gallons by only including the volume up to the full line.The warranty is 5 years parts and labor.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,June 30, 2015,B00SMLJPS2,Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Plus Allergy,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SMLJPS2,Dyson,$573.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Good Replacement For the Makita 1434 Battery,I purchased this Upstart 14.4 volt battery from the same seller (Certified Battery) on ebay about 4 months ago. In that timeI've used it about 5 days per week, recharged it about 30 - 50 times, and it's still working perfectly.I use it in my fabulous Makita impact driver (6935FD), although it's also seen use in my other Makita 14.4 tools (saw, drill, light, etc).Pros:o every bit as powerful as the original Makita 1434 2.6 amp hr battery, seems even a bit more powerful (it should be, if it's 3.3 amp hr rating is accurate).o less expensive than the 1434 (by about twenty bucks)o shipped promptlyCons:o fit is not quite as good as the original Makita battery, but acceptable (the only problem I've had is it is sometimes a bit difficult to remove from the tool).o I dislike the red color, and prefer the black of my original batteries (yes, I am guilty of nit-picking here).Conclusion:A worthy option to consider if you need fresh batteries to replace you Makita 1434 2.6 AH cells.A word of advice if you are shopping for a 3rd party battery - make sure it's amp hour rating is the same or higher than your original, or you are bound to be disappointed. I notice there are many less expensive 14.4 volt batteries available on amazon,with amp hour ratings significantly less than the 2.6 AH of the 1434 battery.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,I Like it so much Ive already bought a second one,Review VIM Tools HBR4 Ratchet BitTitle: I Like it so much Ive already bought a second oneFor many years I have carried a 1/4 ratchet driver in my tool belt, both for getting into tight spaces, for general use, and for when I need more torque than a screwdriver provides but still want to feel what Im doing.A few months ago my trusty ratchet driver died, and I began searching around here on amazon and elsewhere for a replacement. Thanks to the good folks who take time to leave thoughtful reviews, I decided to give this ratchet a try, and I must say its a huge step up from my old one.It has a much finer ratchet effect due to its large number of teeth (52 I think). That means it works much more quickly in confined spaces. It also gives it a lovely feel, like a fine precision instrument (which, indeed it is).The head is tiny, even smaller than my original tool, which is a huge plus.All parts, with the exception of the grip area of the handle, are steel, including the tiny reverse lever. I mention this because I recall one review that stated it was plastic.The bit is held tightly in place by friction, and there is a through hole which makes it easy to remove the tightly held bits. You can rotate the black metal ring for quick threading, and use the handle to finish when things tighten up.For the modest price, this is a very good value.If you constantly use 1/4 drive bits as I do, you should definitely consider this high quality, modestly priced tool.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 30, 2015,B003TSW0DA,VIM Tools HBR4 Ratchet Bit,Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TSW0DA,VIM Tools,$15.31
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Friction is your friend,I purchased this set a few months ago, to complement the larger blades that came with my Fein MM 350Q, in the hopes that it would come in handy some day (it did, big time).I did some tests to learn how best to use the various attachments and immediately ran into a problem with blade slippage that some others have reported. It was nothing too severe, but I could see that sometimes a securely fastened blade would shift slightly during a cut. I was able to fix the problem with a few simple steps.I noticed the blade holder had some burrs, so I sanded these off to increase the contact area and to roughen the mating surfaces (using 180 grit sandpaper). I also sanded the contact area of each blade on both sides. Then I cleaned everything with alcohol, including the screws and threads (which appeared to have some grease on them). Since then I havent had any more slipping of blades and am very satisfied with this set.I found the cutting blades worked very well in both hard and soft woods, easily as well as the larger regular sized blades. The kerf is quite small, perhaps less than the regular sized blades (I did not measure, so cant say for certain).I also did some measurements, by tracing around the holder and blades on a piece of graph paper - see the accompanying photo.1. the blades are held in place by two M4 screws, set about 3/8 apart.2. all attachments are either 1-5/16 or 1-11/16 long.3. attachments are 13/16 wide at the connection point4. cutting blade width is about 3/8 wide on the cutting end.I used the short wood cutting blade recently to replace a lever operator in a 20+ year old wood window. The mechanism was built-in to the window, and for awhile I thought I would have to completely remove the window and destroy some trim pieces in order to get to the lever. Then I thought of my multimaster and decided I had nothing to loose. I was able to surgically cut out two trim pieces, install the new lever, then simply re-install the trim as the saw kerf was so thin (all with the window in-place on a second story bedroom). Its not 100% perfect, but its close enough that only careful inspect would reveal the cuts. The hours saved on this single job easily pay for the small cost of this set.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 5, 2015,B000XW1A9U,Fein 63901025060 Mini Cut and File Set,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XW1A9U,Fein,$27.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Fits Fein MM 350Q,Many Bosch blades fit on my Fein 350Q without needing this adapter. So why did I buy it?1. Bosch blades can only be mounted in 4 positions, at 90 degree angles (0, 90, ). Most of the time this is good enough, but sometimes more finesse is needed.2. This allows Bosch blades to mount in 12 positions, at 30 degree angles (0, 30, 60, 90, ).3. Other blades, that are compatible with the Bosch OIS standard should also fit (although I havent tried this - so far Ive only used Fein and Bosch blades).This little plate is accurately built. It fits my Fein MM 350Q perfectly.The only drawback to it is that it makes blade mounting and rotating a bit more clumsy than otherwise, since youve got two things to line up rather than just a single blade.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 6, 2015,B004KW15PS,Bosch OIS001 OIS Adapter for Bosch,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KW15PS,Bosch,$0.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Nice Wiper, Bad Database: Does Not Fit Honda CRV,Nice Wiper, Bad Database: Does Not Fit Honda CRVFirst the bad news:Both amazon's "Make Sure It Fits" and Trico's "See all vehicles this product fits" lists claim this blade (Trico 17-210) will fit the driver's side of a 2006 Honda CRV.It does not (too short).The description claims it is a 21 inch refill, however the actual size is just under 20-1/2 inches.Now for the good news:The passenger side blade does indeed fit as promised by amazon's and Trico's databases. It too is about half an inch shorter than specified, being 19.5 rather than 20 inches (Trico 17-200), but it fit's perfectly.Since these seem to be good quality, I decided to keep the blade already installed on the passenger side and order the next size up (Trico 17-220) for the driver's side.The blades are nicely packaged, easy to open without tools or scissors or other pointy objects, and include refreshingly clear instructions (both for removal of old blade and installation of the new one).Last, but not least, amazon made returning the incorrect part about as painless as one could ever hope for. Very much appreciated - thank you amazon!Other thoughts:Perhaps one is best off measuring his existing blades (or more accurately the blade holders), and then ordering the appropriate length Trico blade after taking into account that they are ½ inch shorter than stated.One more detail that may be useful to those measuring their own blades: these Trico's fit in 6 mm wide slots (that is, the blade, measured across the steel side pieces, measures 6 mm which is just a hair under one quarter of an inch).I'm giving this a 5 star rating because the product deserves it.However, if I was rating amazon (which I am not) I would give them 5 stars for the wonderful customer support.----------------------------------Update (April 23, 2012): Installed the 22 inch blade (Trico 17-220) on the driver side of my CRV - it fits perfectly, and works very well.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 12, 2012,B000CRMNM4,Trico 17-210 Teflon Blade Refill designed to fit Trico Teflon blades only-21" (1 refill),Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRMNM4,Trico,$5.74
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Stops Bleeding Dog Nails Quickly and Effectively,Ive been cutting dog nails for more than 15 years, and until recently never had a serious problem if I caused some blood to flow. However about a year ago I cut my Irish Setter and his nail bled for hours, creating a mess, and lots of anxiety for all concerned. During this episode we tried all the usual home remedies including corn-starch, flower, etc. but nothing really stopped the bleeding.So, I invested in newer, better clippers, and also purchased a 1.5 ounce container of Cardinal Labs Styptic powder, just in case. The better clippers (Millers Forge) allowed me to clip away for almost a year before I drew blood again. This time I was ready with styptic powder which I applied immediately, just using my finger to scoop out the powder and rub it on the bloody claw. It worked far better than I expected, stopping the rather significant flow of blood in under a minute. I waited a few minutes, then took my dog outside in case the bleeding should resume. It never did, ever though the 1 year old puppy was quite actively moving about.I am very impressed with this product and will continue to keep it on hand every time I am trimming nails. A 1.5 ounce container is plenty, and should last for years.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,June 4, 2015,B004PJ55KC,Cardinal Laboratories Remedy and Recovery Professional Groomer's Styptic Powder for Pets, 1.5-Ounce,Pet Supplies,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PJ55KC,Cardinal Laboratories,$7.96

We used the device for one month, with the unlimited data plan, during which our total download amount was about 2GB (at least that's what the device web page stated).Pros:o On a good day, it works reasonably well, giving download speeds of approximately 150 kbps.o Unlimited data plan is a nice idea, and a reasonable price (if it worked).Cons:o Speed / performance is highly variable and independent of signal strength. We often experienced very sluggish performance, many times in areas with good signal strength. The response on many occasions was so slow it was essentially impossible to use for simple web surfing.o Software is rather awkward and confusing to set up initially.o Software is somewhat buggy during day to day operation. It often takes more than one try to make it work correctly (a "try" meaning either removing and re-inserting the adapter, or rebooting the computer with the adapter in, or out - usually one of these will get the thing to recognize the device and make a connection.)Summary:Not recommended.One wonders about the honesty of Virgin Mobile. Although there is no way for me to prove it, I strongly suspect the company routinely throttles down the performance of the device, perhaps because they have sold more unlimited data plans than there network is capable of servicing.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,February 2, 2011,B00316WHJ2,Virgin Mobile Broadband2Go Wireless USB Device | MC760,Computers & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00316WHJ2,Virgin Mobile,$40.00
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Outstanding tool with unique capabilities,I have owned this saw for 2-1/2 years, and have come to find its unique capabilities indispensable.Having said that, I can understand why some people would have problems with this tool - it is not for everyone. All battery powered tools must compromise between power, size and weight in order to achieve freedom from a 120V cord. This one is no different. It is a very small, very light tool. Its blade spins slower than other battery powered circular saws. Temper your expectations accordingly, expect it to cut at a relaxed rate, and you will be satisfied with it's performance. Assume it should be able to cut as quickly as a saw weighing 3 times as much, and you will be disappointed.I do a lot of woodwork and home renovation. I own many professional quality tools including a total of 4 circular saws. Two are 120 volt models, and two are battery powered. The other battery saw is an 18 volt Bosch with 6-1/2" blade.What I like about the 5094D saw:o It is lighter and smaller by far than any other circular saw. I easily operate it in one hand and SAFELY make cuts in places where no other saw can go. Situations where it has been especially useful include working overhead, sometimes perched atop a high ladder; working in a cramped crawlspace; removing plywood and OSB sheathing material from the wall of a house, cutting trim and siding material.o It's power to weight ratio, and perhaps more importantly power-to-saw-kerf ratio is far superior to most, if not all other battery powered saws. While my 18V Bosch sometimes stalls during heavy cuts, this little Makita has never, ever stalled. Like any circular saw, it will kick back if mishandled, however the result if much less forceful, and hence less dangerous which is important when working overhead or on a ladder.o Low noise level. By far the quietest circular saw I own. No hearing protection is required when using this little saw (the only exception is that sometimes the material being cut may make a racket, but it does not happen often).o Clean. Because the kerf is so tiny, this saw generates far less dust than any other power saw. The low speed of the blade ensures that little of it is blown into the air. I estimate more than ninety percent of the wood dust remains on the workpiece where it can be easily vacuumed or bushed away. When working inside a house this is the cleanest power saw I have, even cleaner than a jig saw or a miter saw connected to a dust collector.o Battery life is very good. You can do a lot of work with this tool before needing a recharge. Also, the NiMh batteries can be recharged at any time without harm and, if you are in a hurry, they can be partially recharged and used.o Reasonable cutting capability. As mentioned previously, cutting occurs at a relaxed rate (although far faster than you could do by hand). This saw will readily cross cut one-by boards such as 3/4" thick fir or pine. It also nicely cuts sheet goods. I have used it extensively on half inch thick OSB, as well as fir, pressure treated and Baltic birch plywood (Baltic birch is essentially solid hardwood). I've used it less often on thicker sheet goods but it certainly does cut 3/4" thick stock, although a bit more slowly than the half inch stuff. As with all circular saws, the underside cuts very cleanly, with the only tear out on the top side (although the tiny kerf limits this to an acceptable level for most work - use masking tape or other methods if required).o Tiny diameter blade makes it possible to plunge cut closer to the line than larger blades can. For example if you are cutting half inch thick sheathing a 7-1/4 inch blade will be 5/8" beyond the point that the 3-3/8 blade will be when you stop the cut. Sorry if this seems obscure - it is difficult to explain without a diagram - perhaps if sketching both diameters it will clarify things. Practically speaking, it means I can use this to make rough cut outs in sheathing or other material where I would normally need a different kind of saw (like a Rotozip, or jig saw).What I do not like about this saw:o While it is ruggedly built, and very durable (like most other Makita tools), the baseplate is simply folded steel. It works, but a solid aluminum alloy baseplate ought to be standard in a saw of this price range. Also the pivot points are not quite as tight as I would like, so there is just a little slop when adjusting the base height or angle.In summary, this is a rugged, useful tool. I know of no other circular saw that can compare to it in terms of size and weight. I use mine often, and would not be without it, especially for construction and installation work.-----------------------------UPDATE, November 27, 2010:Having now owned this saw for about 4-1/2 years I like it even better than when I wrote my first review (I shall try to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5 stars, if amazon allows me to).I have used the saw to cut large quantities of sheet goods (mostly half inch OSB and plywood), situated on a bench and often attached to a wall. This little saw is wonderful for renovations that involved removal, or alteration of the existing wall sheathing. It's very comfortable to use it while standing on a ladder or in other awkward situations where a heavier, bulkier saw just would not fit.This saw has cut thousands of linear feet of siding material including ¾ inch pine and cedar boards, and ½ inch Canexel planks (similar to high density fibre board). Once one becomes familiar with the tool, it is easy to consistently make free-hand cuts that are accurate to 1/16 or better (I use a guide when I need a tighter tolerance).The saw has been completely reliable and problem free. The batteries have held up very well: only one of my three batteries is "sluggish", but that is perfectly acceptable considering they are used extensively in the saw, impact driver, drill, and light, often in extreme hot/cold outdoor conditions.Kudo's to the engineers at Makita for designing such a wonderful tool.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 11, 2008,B0001AGNPU,Makita 5094DWD 14.4-volt NiMH 3-3/8-inch Cordless Circular Saw,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AGNPU,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Durable, Elegant, High Quality Corkscrew,Review of Monopol Bell Corkscrew BAROLO - Made in GermanyI purchased this wonderful corkscrew two years ago. I have used it to open about 1,000 bottles of wine (not all consumed by me, of course, ahem...). It has performed flawlessly, and shows little sign of wear, which leads me to conclude that it will probably outlast me.The package was shipped very promptly, direct from Germany, by the amazon seller Loewen-Germany.The corkscrew is of extremely fine quality, beautifully machined and finished, with a pleasant heft to it, without being too heavy. The box it comes in is meant to be disposable, but I found it nice enough to be used for permanent storage, although it does take up extra space in my drawer, as opposed to being stored loose.Some practice is needed to get the "zen" of using it, but once one does the uncorking operation may be performed with elegance and efficiency.For a detailed description of the entire uncorking process, please refer to the excellent review posted by Jackson Harris.I have opened many thousands of wine bottles, using a variety of mechanisms. This Monopol is my favorite by far.A nice feature of this design is that the operator has full control over how far the cork is pierced before the extraction phase begins. This allows for successful extraction of any length of cork.If you are an impatient sort, you should know that the popular rabbit/Metrokane lever style opener is faster, by about ten seconds. However the three that I've owned all seem to fail after just 200 to 400 bottles, sometimes in rather spectacular fashion (as in screw bends, drives cork into the bottle, red wine sprays everywhere). But, I digress.If you enjoy using fine quality tools and implements, and you are willing to devote five or ten additional seconds to the wine opening process, then you are likely to be very satisfied with this high quality Monopol Barlo corkscrew.Cheers!Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,March 28, 2013,B0015D077M,none,none,none,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Just what I needed,A few weeks ago I knew nothing whatsoever about the GIMP.I downloaded version 2.6 and decided to learn how to use it.After a frustrating attempt to educate myself with the onlinehelp files I turned to Akkana Peck's Beginning Gimp, second edition.I found her book to be just what I needed. It's a big book at justunder 600 pages, but I found it a reasonably quick read due in largepart to many full color examples and Akkana's clear writing style.It is not easy to write technical documentation, and so it is wonderfulto encounter such a well written work. Ms. Peck has the rare talentof being able to present volumes of technical information in a mannerthat has enough detail to be useful, without overwhelming the reader withminutiae, or being boring. Her style makes heavy use of examples,which are nicely illustrated (kudos to the publisher to spending the extramoney for color images). Key concepts are presented in a well ordered manner, making it quite painless to understand the "Zen" of GIMP.After reading the book cover to cover, working through most of theexample exercises, I feel I have expanded my image processing abilitiesimmensely. By the way, you can (and should) download all the examplematerial found on the publishers web site.Many thanks to the extraordinarily talented programmers who createdthis remarkable program. Thanks also to those who have created theonline help files (which are quite useful once one has a basic understanding of the GIMP).And thanks again to Akkana Peck for making the initial learning curve so pleasant!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,March 15, 2009,1430210702,Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional (Expert's Voice in Open Source),Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210702,Apress,$32.48
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Very Good WWII Story,This is a very enjoyable World War II story. The author, Mr. Wilson seems to really know his stuff, and he writes very well. I like his style so much that I have read three of his books so far.If you like this sort of fiction, I highly recommend the reader try My. Wilson's other fine works as well. If you want to read things in the proper sequence I recommend the following order:1. Voyage of the Gray Wolves2. Between the Hunters and the Hunted3.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Nice Wiper, Fits Honda CRV,Nice Wiper, Fits Honda CRVThis Trico 17-220 is a perfect fit in the driver side of my 2006 Honda CRV (original factory blade bracket).Note that both the amazon and Trico databases are in error at the time of this review, recommending the Trico 17-210 which is too short to fit in the brackets of my CRV.If you are measuring your brackets, you should note that this blade is shorter than the 22 inches stated in the description. It's actually about half an inch shorter, being 21.5 rather than 22 inches (the metal sides are even shorter at 21-1/4 inches). Based on my experiences with three different sizes of these blades, it seems that they are all about one half inch shorter than promised.These are good quality blades, although I cannot comment on long term durability.The blades are nicely packaged, easy to open without tools or scissors or other pointy objects, and include refreshingly clear instructions (both for removal of old blade and installation of the new one).Installation is surprisingly quick, requiring only a common pair of pliers and taking less than 60 seconds once you get the hang of it.Other thoughts:One detail that may be useful to those measuring their own blades: these Trico's fit in 6 mm wide slots (that is, the blade, measured across the steel side pieces, measures 6 mm which is just a hair under one quarter of an inch).My rating is based on the blade quality, (I am ignoring the unfortunate database errors and the half inch length issue, in hopes it will be corrected at some point).If you are looking for a perfect passenger side replacement, try the Trico 17-200.Happy motoring.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 23, 2012,B000CRKOLQ,Trico 17-220 Teflon Blade Refill designed to fit Trico Teflon blades only-22" (1 refill),Automotive,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRKOLQ,Trico,$5.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Substantially Heavier and Thicker Than Regular Paper Bags,We purchased these on amazon.com from ReStockIt about a month ago. The idea was to use them in our districts trash reduction program, in which virtually all organic waste is separated out and composted, rather than going into the landfill. We needed sturdy, organic bags (i.e. paper) to hold this waste and allow easy disposal in the bins.So far, we are very pleased with how these heavy duty paper bags are working.These are good quality, noticeably heavier weight than regular paper bags you may have come across at the super market or elsewhere. In fact, they are so heavy that I was surprised when I picked these up at the UPS store to take them home - it was a very heavy parcel!Not much to complain about here, except one minor thing. The shipping wrap was damaged slightly when we received this (although the bags were fine), but thats more the fault of UPS than the seller.If you are in need of heavy duty paper bags, look no further - these are great!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,June 4, 2015,B001AQRV6O,Duro SK1675 1/6 Natural 75# Paper Grocery Bags (BAGSK1675) Category: Paper Bags,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQRV6O,Duro Paper Bag Manufacturing, Company,$40.70
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Specs and Details About This Potentially Useful Gadget,How one feels about Belkin's WeMo Maker largely depends on one's expectations. Before you decide to purchase this, it's a good idea to study the details of what it can and cannot do for you. You need some knowledge of how to work with simple circuits in order to make use of this device.The Good:Control and sense things remotely, from anywhere you have internet access, using your smart phoneControl is via a relay, essentially just a simple computer controlled ON-OFF switch.Works with iPad, however app is designed for the phone and is a bit clunky on the tablet (for example it only displays in portrait mode at this time).The WeMo can provide a small amount of power to an external device: 5V @ 100 mA max.Reasonably simple to get the device and the app up and running and talking to each other.The app is fairly self-explanatory and easy to use (a good thing because documentation is sparse).There is community support via a forum on the Belkin website with some enthusiastic participants who are willing to help novices.There is the potential to use IFTTT (IfThisThenThat) to do some cool things, which relies on an external web service (ifttt.com). This is a nascent service that describes itself as "experimental", and not "tested in any manner", which checks for trigger data every fifteen minutes. Could be very interesting and fun if you can live with the disclaimer and response times.The Bad:documentation is scant, leaves much to be desired.the sensor only detects ON-OFF conditions, and there is only a single sensor. You will not be measuring temperature, pressure, speed, and other analogue inputs with this device.the app does not always work reliably, and has a few rough edges, which I expect will be corrected in time.Some Technical Specifications and Other Details:The WeMo itself is very light, weighing under 120 grams (4 oz.) (power supply and cord not included)WeMo is a rectangular box, with a rotatable antenna on the side. Dimensions of the box (excluding the antenna) are about 3-1/8 by 3-1/8 by 1-3/8" high. The antenna adds about 3/4" to the overall width and 2-3/4" to the height when rotated to the upward position.The power supply will be familiar to most of us tablet and smart phone users. It plugs into the wall and provides a USB port. The WeMo comes complete with a USB-to-micro USB cable. The power supply is rated for input of 100-240V, 0.5A, 50-60 Hz. It outputs 5V @ 2.1 A to the USB plug.Using an inexpensive digital meter I measured the power consumption of the WeMo at 120V. It draws 10 mA when the relay is OFF, and 13.5 mA when the relay was ON (contracts closed).If you run the WeMo constantly I calculate it will consume about 10-14 kWh per year, which will cost you about $1 or $2 dollars per year depending on your electrical rates.The relay, which you control via the app, the sensor, or the buttons on the WeMo, is rated for 24V @ 1 Amp or 24 Watts max.The sensor is essentially an ON-OFF detector. It can easily be hooked up by connecting the "S" and "-" terminals to any kind of single pole switch.The relay may be activated by pressing the large round button on the front of the WeMo, or by pressing a smaller round button on the back of the device. The back button is labelled "1/0", the front button is not labelled.The relay can be activated in the WeMo app by pressing the button icon, or by setting rules.The relay can be activated automatically when the sensor detects an input (via a rule in the app).The relay can be activated at sunrise, sunset, and all times throughout the day (via rules in the app).the relay may be set to either Toggle or Momentary mode.In toggle mode when you activate it (using a button, the sensor, or the app) it goes on and stays on. Next activation it goes off and stays off. Next activation it goes on and stays on. And so on.In Momentary mode each activation causes to relay to briefly go ON, then off again in a fraction of a second.when the relay is ON (contacts are closed) a LED on the front glows green, as does another LED on the back of the Wemo.The WeMo app shows the state of the relay, and the sensor. I found this a bit spotty. Sometimes I had to manually press the "refresh" button to get the app to poll the WeMo and pickup the correct state. Sometimes it just would not see the state of the sensor. I expect this to be fixed in a future version of the app.The relay can be programmed to activate when the sensor triggers ON. I hooked the sensor to a push button, which allowed me to trigger the relay each time I pressed the button (closing the switch contacts). This worked well as long as triggered the sensor no more than about once every 2 seconds. Numerous other programming variations are possible, such as having the relay go off a certain number of minutes after the sensor triggers (up to 1 hour, or stay on permanently).========= Update: Dec 17, 2014 ===============================================I was asked a question about device control when the internet provider's modem goes down. Since I now have both the Belkin WeMo Maker and the Lutron Caseta system I decided to test and compare both of them in various scenarios, to see if they can be controlled via an iPhone. Here is what I discovered:TEST............................................................................Belkin WeMo............Lutron Caseta---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Unplug ethernet between Smart Bridge and router............N/A..........................NO2. No AC power to Modem & router.....................................NO...........................NO3. No internet connection (Modem & router powered)...........YES..........................NOA YES in the table above indicates the device can be controlled from my iPhone.My cable modem & router are integrated into a single device, so am unable to power these down separately.Both the Lutron dimmer, and the Belkin WeMo can be controlled locally (via their hardware switches) during any of the tests above.The WeMo may be a preferred choice if your application requires phone or tablet control in absence of an internet connection.===========================================================================Notes:I tested this device using my Apple iPhone and iPad, using the latest version of iOS 8.Summary:It's very cool and fun to be able to connect simple things to the internet, and especially nice to be able to see the state of the sensor from anywhere. I applaud Belkin for making this ground-breaking product. It seems to me Belkin has already done the hard part - internet connectivity - and I hope that in future they will offer a WeMo with multiple sensors and relays. For now, if one has the right application, or simply wants to experiment, this device will get your feet wet, and whet your appetite for more.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 11, 2014,B00N32H7U8,WeMo Maker,MP3 Players & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N32H7U8,WeMo,$69.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,useful, powerful tool,This is a great tool. It has proven to be much more useful than I ever thought it would.Pros:Well built, high quality tool (like many other Bosch products).Versatile. I've used it too cut metal roof sheets (using zipmate)o cut other metal including nails, bolts, rebar.o cut holes in drywall. (The trick to accurate, straight cuts is to use a straightedge - this applies to all rotary tools).o sand wood.o rout wood. The included standoff attachment works, but is rather unsteady. I adapted a Dremel Advantage plunge router base to work with my rotozip (the round collars are the same diameter, making this quite easy to do). With this setup, I've been very pleased with the rotozip's performance as a cordless router. It has ample power with smaller bits such as 1/4" round over, or a 1/2" dish cutter. I use it more as a router than for any other purpose.The tools (wrench, collets, and some bits) all fit in the handle, and so are with you wherever you are using the tool (a nice feature in a portable tool).Product support is very good. When I first spoke with Rotozip about the loose handle, they promptly mailed me a new one. Unfortunately, while a better fit, it is still not as solid as one would like. However, it is "good enough", especially considering all of the other good points about this tool.Batteries and charger are compatible with my other 18V Bosch bluecore tools (jigsaw, circular saw and planer). They charge very quickly (1/2 hour). However, if the tool has been worked hard the charger waits till the battery cools down. In my experience this can extend the charge cycle by up to another 1/2 hour.Cons:o Somewhat wobbly handle. It works, but is not as rock solid as I would like. That's my main reason for a not giving the tool a 5 star rating. This bothered me a lot when I first purchased the tool. However, after more than a year of use I hardly notice it anymore.o Rather noisy. However, to be fair, it is no louder than my other plug-in routers spinning at 30,000 rpm.Other:I also have the sanding kit. It makes the rotozip into an aggressive disk sander, that removes wood very quickly. This is for rough work only. While I've only used it on wood, I imagine it would remove paint, rust, and other stuff quite effectively.Remember, this is a battery powered tool. If you've got a mountain of metal to cut, or wood to rout, I would probably use a plug-in tool. However, I 've surprised myself with how often I reach for this tool first. The portability is well worth the trade off of a limited runtime in many cases.Highly recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 14, 2008,B000E64WKE,RotoZip 75-DC1AA RZ18-2100 Cordless Spiral Saw by Bosch,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E64WKE,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Good Stuff!,Review of US Elite Chardonnay Varietal Grape Concentrate.As a Canadian wine lover, who is not rich, I turned to making my own wine from kits a number of years ago. To date I've made over 90 kits (about 2,500 bottles). The most important lesson I have learned is that to get good results you need to use good juice (or concentrate, to be specific). It is easy to make kit wine whose quality is on par with wine that would cost $8 per bottle at retail in the USA, or about $13 in Canada. With additional effort you can achieve even better results, but I digress....This kit makes a good Chardonnay, medium bodied, nicely oaked, with smooth, clean varietal flavors and a satisfying finish. I used all the included fining agents, and followed the instructions to the letter with two exceptions: I extended the carboy-aging process by 30 days and I did not "chill proof" the wine. The resulting wine is beautifully clear, with a rich golden hue.I felt a little bit uneasy paying so much for such a small package of concentrate (6.8 liters). I typically make kits that contain 16 to 18 liters of concentrate. (Note: all these kits yield the same amount of wine, about 28-30 bottles). I did some research and found that US Elite claims the amount of concentrate is not as important as the quality. Based on my results with their white wine, I cannot dispute that claim, although I am curious to see if the same holds true for their red wine.This is my first US Elite kit, and I am quite pleased with it. I certainly intend to make more of this Chardonnay, and will probably give one of their reds a try, after which I will post another review.Cheers!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 26, 2009,B001FSJ4JO,US Elite Chardonnay Varietal Grape Concentrate,Grocery & Gourmet Food,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSJ4JO,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,capable, durable driver,I've owned this driver for over two years, and it's been a tough, useful tool. I bought it after my first trusty Black and Decker screwdriver developed problems holding it's charge (it was over 7 years old, so I'm not complaining at all).Pros:o a fairly long time between charges.o fairly powerful especially considering it's only 3.6vo clutch mechanism (some of the cheaper screwdrivers omit this very useful feature).o automatic clutch lockout (so you can use it like a manual screwdriver is the battery dies or it does not have enough torque to finish seating a screw).o articulating feature makes this more comfortable to hold than straight-line drivers, but still give that ability for situations where it's needed (like manually driving screws when the driver does not have enough torque or the battery dies).o tough and durable (for a non-professional level tool)Cons:o slow speed can become tedious if you've got a lot of screws to drive.o switch is a bit clumsy to use.o no variable speed control which makes it difficult to use in delicate situations.o built-in battery takes a long time to recharge (say overnight at least). When the battery dies you're done for the day.o surprisingly bulky, even with the articulating feature.o automatic clutch lockout sometimes does not engage properly. Can be rather irritating.I'm giving this 4 stars based on the fact it's a good buy for an under thirty dollar screwdriver.If you want the ultimate screwdriver, check out the Metabo Powermaxx Plus, which I recently reviewed with 5 stars rating (it also does angle driving and drilling). However, for those who cannot justify spending over a hundred bucks for the extra capabilities and quality, this Black and Decker 3.6 volt driver may be just right.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,August 13, 2007,B000077CPO,Black & Decker 9078 3.6-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Screwdriver,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000077CPO,none,none

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,I almost returned this set, but now am glad I didn't,Drill America DWT40PC-ROUND #4-1/2&#34; Carbon Steel Tap and Die Set with Round Die reviewSummary:I purchased this DWT40PC set for just over eighty dollars, knowing full well that there are numerous cheaper options available. There were no reviews on this set at the time, but based on the price and photos I was hoping to get my moneys worth. I had become frustrated attempting to use a cheap tap and die set which was giving me very poor results, even though I was using my Taig lathe to hold the dies while thread cutting. I was not sure if this was the fault of the cheap dies, my inexperience, or perhaps both. This Drill America set immediately made it clear that most of my problems had been due to using cheap dies. I am overall quite happy with this set, and would recommend it with a few reservations.There is much more to like about this set than there is to dislike. However it does have a few problems.The Bad:o The case is not very good. It is a generic, cheap plastic thing that will not hold all the pieces in place unless one is very careful and always keeps it horizontal. Because of this all the parts arrived jumbled together.o There is absolutely no information provided with this set. No instructions, no manufacturers name. The taps and dies are labelled (seem to be laser etched), thank goodness.o One of the taps had rust on the base (not the cutting edges). It does not affect its operation, and was cleaned off with some light abrasive.o The dies are chamfered at each end. Its my understanding that dies are typically chamfered at only one end, which is used to start threading. Then it can be flipped so that threads can be cut closer to any shoulder that may be present. Not a big deal for me so far as I have not needed that capability, but I thought it should be mentioned.o These are split dies, and a few of the screws that adjust the gap do not land perpendicular to the opposing face. In practice that has not been a big deal, but it does make for a poor first impression.o The dies have round holes drilled in the sides, so the die can be gripped in the holder. I noticed some of the holes appear slightly oblong, rather than perfectly round. In use this has not caused me any trouble, but it is another sign of slightly sloppy workmanship.o One of the dies, the smallest #4, appeared to have some defects in it as the cutting teeth were not symmetrical on each edge. However I have been able to cut a number of threads using this die and they have turned out just fine. Yet another example of slightly sloppy manufacturing.o The company that manufactures this set, Drill America, has a website and contact information. I attempted to contact them regarding some of these problems and they simply never responded to me. So customer service is essentially nonexistent.At this point you may be wondering why I did not just send this set back. Good question! That brings me to The Good:o These dies cut really well! The difference between my original cheap set, and these Drill America dies is literally night and day. The cheap set would not even start a thread unless I used my lathe to reduce the diameter of the rod by many tens of thousands of an inch. Even then great force was required to cut threads, which inevitably wound up being loose threads. This Drill America set cuts wonderfully in brass, aluminum, soft steel, and plastic without any need to reduce the rod diameter. Note that I have done most of my threading with the help of my Taig lathe.o The taps also cut very well, and for the most part I have done all of the tapping freehand. Once again, the cheap set required oversize holes to work, but the Drill America cuts fine using the standard hole sizes (as specified in Machinerys Handbook).o A nice bonus for anyone who works with wood, is that these taps cut fine grained woods very nicely. For example I was able to tap a 1/2-13 thread in some Birch, and then made up a plastic (PVC) nut which fits nice and snug and survives numerous re-attachments. The smaller diameters Ive tried (3/8 and 1/4) have also worked well. I use hardened steel bushings with 1/2-20 threads to make drilling jigs and this has worked quite well, saving the hassle of using the steel threaded inserts (my bushings are from LeeValley, so of course good quality, however similar looking ones are available here on amazon).I must confess, that when I received this set, having it literally fall out of the cheap plastic case, then noticing the (mostly) cosmetic problems, I almost packed it back up and returned it. However, I decided to take the time to try it out, and that changed my mind. I am now quite happy with it.If money was no object, its my understanding that the gold standard in split dies is the Irwin brand. Unfortunately those sets go for close to two hundred dollars, and are hard to find (at the time of this review I could not find them on amazon, my favorite place to shop).Hope you find this information useful.Regards,Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,October 23, 2014,B00DLE24SS,Drill America DWT40PC-ROUND #4-1/2" Carbon Steel Tap and Die Set with Round Die,Industrial & Scientific,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLE24SS,Drill America,$39.54
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Above Average Quality Product that Works Well,Review of Moshi Teraglove Screen Cleaner for all Kindle Fire ModelsThis is a screen cleaning kit comprised of a glove and a tiny water bottle that sprays a fine mist onto the glove. There are two kinds of fibers to choose from on the glove: black (for serious cleaning) and gray for dusting / polishing. The black is called "Terahedron microfiber". I don't much care for it's slightly prickly feel on my fingers, but it does work well if one's screen is very dirty. Most of the time I just use the gray material which has a soft, pleasant feel to it. A tiny bit water is helpful, but really only necessary if the screen is really gunked up.I have used it extensively for the past few weeks and I like it. So does my wife.Obviously, this works on other devices than the Kindle Fire.I was initially concerned that the tiny water spraying bottle would inevitably be knocked over and leak onto something. I was half right. It did get knocked over, and lay on it's side (full of water) for a number of days before I discovered it. However, I was pleased to discover that not a single drop of water leaked from the bottle.This product has above average materials and build quality.Recommended.A Digression and Warning:When cleaning any electronic item, never, ever use anything other than a slightly damp cloth. I have known more than one person who has used an ammonia-based cleaning product (aka Windex) with disastrous results. One person routinely cleaned the flat panel console of an oven with such a product and the panel eventually failed (took about 3+ years). The cost to repair was so great that she opted to purchase a new oven. Another person routinely cleaned the front of a new flat screen TV - a little more than a year later the remote control stopped working. Most probable cause was the ammonia got into the IR sensor and killed it.Of course, I cannot say for sure the ammonia-based cleaner was at fault in these two cases, but internet research led me to believe that's what did it. Based on what I learned, I would not take the chance of using anything other than water on my electronics.Disclosure:I received this product for free, in exchange for writing this review. Just thought you should know that.This is a short-term test, I've only had the product for a few weeks and so cannot comment on durability (although I expect it will last a long time, based on the high build quality).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,February 25, 2013,B005GJC01C,Moshi Teraglove Screen Cleaner for all Kindle Fire Models,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GJC01C,moshi,$18.00
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Excellent Small Clippers for Big Dogs,I am very happy with these little clippers. They are significantly sharper, and more effective than two other brands I have tried (one a well-known name brand from Walmart). I have been using these for 11 months to trim the nails of my two large, 90 lb. Irish Setters.Other clippers I tried were so dull and harsh cutting that it upset my dogs and caused clipping to be a very stressful situation (and they cost significantly more!). With these Millers Forge clippers the big red boys are much more relaxed - I wont go so far as to say they now enjoy being clipped, but with a few cheese treats we get the job done in about ten minutes with little fuss.The only negative I can think of is that you need to hold these the right side up, otherwise the safety lock will slide into place in the middle of your cutting session. This isnt a big deal, if this happens just rotate the clippers 180 degrees and youll be able to clip away without further problems.Also, for what its worth, I use these with the safety depth setting piece rotated out of the way so I can better see what Im doing.Dont let the low price fool you - these are very good clippers!P.S. If, like me, you occasionally get too carried away and draw blood, you may wish to invest in a small jar of Cardinal Laboratories Styptic Powder. I have only had to use it once  yeah- im that good :-)  but I was very impressed with how quickly it stopped a gushing flow of blood.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Excellent resource for both iPhone and iPad,I bought and read this entire book to learn about my iPhone, and am very impressed at the information Mr. Pogue has assembled. Since I read it on my iPad (using Kindle app), I tried out many of the settings and suggestions on it as well. A double bonus, thanks to the intelligently designed similarity between iOS devices I found I learned a great deal about my iPad as well as the phone.While one can learn much about iOS devices via Internet searches and apple docs, David Pogue typically presents better, more accurate information with the added benefit that it is pleasant to to read as well. On example is making ones own ring tones, using garage band. Gives you much more flexibility and saves the irritating cost of such tiny snippets of sound.I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more about their phone or tablet.Apologies for the awkward style, and brief review, as I am writing this on my iPad using the on screen keyboard.Regards,Joe mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 27, 2013,B009WA0VA8,iPhone: The Missing Manual (Missing Manuals),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009WA0VA8,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Why its good to be dim,This Lutron MSCL-OP153M motion sensor dimmer costs more than others, but if you are sensitive about your home environment, it may well be worth it to you. I have installed 3 of these in my home during the past few years, and am very pleased with them. I was on the verge of purchasing a fourth switch when amazon offered me a free one as part of the vine program, in exchange for writing a review - an offer I just couldnt resist.If your light switch is in a favorable location, you can replace it with a motion sensor and the lights will turn on automatically when you walk into the room. Very handy in places like garages, laundry rooms, workshops - basically any room you tend to enter with your hands full.The most obvious thing setting these Lutron Maestro sensors apart, is the pleasant, soothing, fade-to-on and fade-to-off effect. When we come home at night, our hall lights smoothly fade to on as we walk through the front door. We no longer need a constantly burning night-light in the bathroom: as a guest enters the room the lights gracefully fade-on, and then turn themselves off just as gracefully a few minutes after the room is vacated.Other, less expensive occupancy sensors can do a similar job, but the big downside is they snap on, and snap off abruptly. They are a good choice if you are on a tight budget, or if your lights cannot be dimmed (most fluorescent tubes cannot). There are many brands of this harsh style switch, including Lutron (I installed one in my mothers laundry room with non-dimmable fluorescent lights and it works fine). But dont kid yourself, the experience of this abrupt on-off style switch is far inferior compared to the Maestro dimming sensor. In most applications, I would probably re-lamp the room with bulbs that dim in order to use the Maestro.The Good:Clear, comprehensive instructions come with the switch, detailing the most common installations. Plus you can look up additional details online for special cases.The wiring job is easy, and straight-forward IF you are replacing a single-switch-controlled light. Just wire it in exactly like the switch you are replacing and it will work fine.Can be wired into situations where more two switches control a single light (curiously called a three way configuration in the electrical trades). This situation is a bit tricky so you will need to follow the instructions carefully, but it can be done (if I can do it, probably you can too!). This extra complexity isnt really a knock against Lutron, because even regular, mechanical 3-way switches can be a challenge to many DIY folks, especially those who dont like to follow instructions.Lutron also makes a companion control that simplifies the 3-way situation, but I have no experience with that.Configurable in numerous ways to suit your taste, or the situation. The switch can function as an occupancy sensor (lights go on when you enter a room, and off when you leave, automatically), a vacancy sensor (you manually turn on the lights, and they go off automatically when you leave the room), and in many other ways. (More details about this below).Completely silent when turning on and off. Less expensive, non-dimming sensors usually use relays - if you have sensitive ears you will hear them click on and off.Lights can be set to any level. The dimmer part of this sensor consists of Lutrons highly regarded Maestro dimmer. See reviews of that particular product for complete details.These switches are available in multiple colors (I have a Burgundy colored one in my wine-room, for example).These are thoughtfully-designed, sophisticated, well made switches - typical of the Lutron brand. I have numerous Lutron switches - some more than 10 years old - and cannot recall encountering a single defective one.The switch gives you ample warning that it is about to turn off the lights by dimming them many seconds before things go dark. This is a wonderful, useful feature - something cheaper, on-off style sensors simply cannot do.The Bad:Your existing switch must be in a favorable location. Basically the switch needs to be able to see you in order to work its magic. (More details available in Lutrons online document.)These switches are a bit bulkier than simple mechanical switches. Not a problem in most cases, and no bulkier than regular dimmer switches, but maybe an issue if youve got a really small, tight, overcrowded electrical box.Summary:Any light that can be dimmed can be automatically and gracefully turned on and off by this sensor switch, as long as it can see you in the room. It will work with most bulbs that are dimmable, (including LEDs, Halogens, etc.)If your bulbs cannot be dimmed, this switch will not work - consider re-lamping with appropriate bulbs, or use an on-off style sensor (e.g. Lutrons MS-OPS2).Other Details:What is a favorable location? A switch located inside the room, next to the doorway is often a very good location. Many switches in bathrooms, laundry rooms, and garages are oriented this way.A less favorable location is a switch that sees too much. For example I have a hallway light switch that sees into another room. It was a challenge to set up because it would turn on when one walked from the kitchen to the living room. I was able to get it working quite nicely by partially covering the sensor with a small piece of tape (basically blinding its view to the left).Configurability. Wow. There are so many ways to configure this switch I will cover only a few of the cool things you can do:Turn lights on when a person enters the room, and off a short time after everyone has left the room. This is often called an Occupancy Sensor.Do NOT turn lights on automatically - only do it if the On button is tapped (like a regular switch). But, once everyone leaves the room turn the lights off automatically. This is often called a Vacancy Sensor.Never automatically turn the lights on during the day - only do it when the room is dark (uses an ambient light sensor for this trick).Turn lights on automatically when someone enters the room. If that someone turns the lights off, dont turn on again automatically until everyone has left the room. You might use this in your TV room.Set the highest and lowest levels the dimmer can be adjusted to. (Useful for certain finicky LED bulbs that dont dim all the way down, for example).Adjust the level the lights go to when the switch automatically turns on (default is 100%).Adjust the rate at which the lights fade on and off.Disable the small, discrete, indicator lights on the switch (not even I am fussy enough to have tried this one - yet!)Set timeout duration to (1, 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes). This is how long lights stay on after the room is vacated. Default is 5 minutes.Adjust the sensitivity of the main sensor (high or low). If this isnt enough, you can cover part of the sensor with tape, as I did for my hallway switch.For additional details about this switch, goto the Lutron website (lutron.com), and search for the document entitled: 048480a.pdf. This 23 page document provides a wealth of information about the sensor range, settings, and myriad configuration options.Buy the way. If you really must know, my latest Lutron switch is going to automatically control the lights in our walk-in closet.Hope you found this review useful.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 6, 2015,B00CAO4NUM,Lutron Maestro LED Dimmer switch with motion sensor, no neutral required, MSCL-OP153M-WH, White,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CAO4NUM,Lutron Electronics Company, Inc.,$36.72
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,2,low quality, does not run true,I've owned this right angle attachment for about a year and used it about ten times. It's the kind of tool I wish I had never purchased - it works, just not very well. Since it's not defective, and the cost is low, I never bothered returning it.Pros: - easy to use, and it seems moderately robust with it's combination of metal gears and bushings housed in a thick plastic casing. - low costCons: - does not run true. If you put a pencil in the chuck it will trace a circle of more than 1/8". This is fine for rough work like drilling large holes through studs with a spade bit. For most anything else I find the wobble in the chuck renders it unacceptable. - big and bulky. The large size of this item makes it only slightly more useful than a small drill, especially when you take into account the large amount of runout in the chuck.Summary:Most of the time when I reach for this tool, I wind up putting it back and not using it, either because chuck runout is too excessive, or the bulk is such that I can find numerous better ways to do the job using quality tools.Construction is metal gears, metal bushings, loosely held in a thick plastic case.Save your money and spend it on a better quality tool.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 5, 2007,B0001GL098,Milescraft 1390 Drill90 Right Angle Drilling and Driving Power Drill Attachment,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001GL098,Milescraft Inc.,$19.98
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,3,A Partial Solution To Deer In Your Garden,Review: Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer RepellentWe live in a semi-rural area (resort community) that is infested with deer. Some neighbors feed them, some hunt them, go figure... I am personally not bothered by deer, but then again, I am not a gardener. My wife on the other hand is a gardener, and she absolutely loathes them, which is why I decided to try this product.I have owned and used this product for two complete seasons (May 2011 - January 2013).It is not a "perfect" solution to deer in ones garden. The deer seem to get used to the device after many weeks of use. However, it does seem to us that there is less damage from the deer than there would otherwise be without the Havahart devices in use. For that reason my wife is still continuing to use these repellents.Should you buy it? Well, if you want a partial solution to a deer problem, go for it. It's certainly much better than having nothing at all.Pros:o Visually, these gadgets are not at all unpleasant to have around the grounds. The green colored tops fit in well with vegetation,and the orange tips (to warn one not to touch the mysterious wires on top and be zapped) are visible enough to do the job without being excessively noticeable.o Box says batteries NOT included, however my package did come with batteries.o Batteries last a fairly long time, typically 4 weeks or more.o Scent bottle is small, idea is user to purchase additional scent bottles (like razor and razor-blades thing?)o Instructions warn that rain interferes with performance (presumably discharges device or washes away the scent) but we have found it is much less of a problem than instructions would indicate (we get significant Spring rainfall).o Started with it outside our house (followed directions re spacing). It worked very well, even after weeks there was no sign of damage to plants from deer. However, as weeks turned into months, we did notice that there was still some damage to plants for the deer. Perhaps they become used to the device.o The electric shock is enough to deter deer, but it will not harm them. In my testing I also found that it will not harm one's spouse (being strictly opposed to pain, I have not tried it on myself).Cons:o There is no obvious way to detect that the battery needs replacing (short of zapping one's spouse with it).o It's a hassle to have to continually reload the scent pads (and purchase the scent).o It's an imperfect solution to the deer problem. My friend has an electric fence around his yard - and that is very close to a perfect solution (ignoring that the electric fencing is rather ugly to behold).Disclosures:I did not pay for this product.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Good Metal Working Overview & Tips,Review of Metalworking Tools and Techniques by Stan BrayI read this book hoping it would help me decide if some metalworking tools would be useful to me. I have absolutely no metalworking experience but I do have some proficiency as a woodworker.Before purchasing this book I used the "look inside" feature here on amazon to peruse the table of contents . It seemed to me that a reasonably broad range of metalworking topics were covered, but none in great depth. The longest chapters are dedicated to "Working Materials" and "The Lathe" at 23 and 22 pages respectively. Although I was a bit concerned that it might be too "light" to be useful, I decided to take a chance and purchase the book regardless. I am very glad that I did.Mr. Bray is one of those rare authors able to cover technical material in a manner that is interesting, clear, and concise. He packs more information into a single page than the average writer can do in two or three. I found the book gave me a very good overview of small scale metalworking. It is well illustrated with many color photographs of very good quality (meaning the reader can easily "see" what the author intends you to - not always the case with metalworking books, especially some of the older ones that rely on black-and-white photos).What I like best about this book is it's large number of practical tips and techniques. Mr. Bray is clearly very experienced, and knowledgeable. I learned a lot of useful stuff, which I was pleasantly surprised to find can also be applied to woodworking as well (more about that later).Following a loose summary of the chapters, tips and techniques I found most interesting.The "Working Materials" chapter describes how to use heat treatment to harden and soften metals and includes advice on blow torches (e.g. why the hottest torch doesn't necessarily provide the most heat), and setting up a simple "hot bench".The "Measuring and Marking Out" chapter has many interesting ideas including the use of a micrometer stand (shop-made) both for storage and to ease measuring small parts. The author shows two examples of simple shop-made depth gauges. He gives practical advice on alternative marking out media (in place of commercial dyes) such as using a felt tipped pen, thinned paint and copper sulphate solution (which is much more permanent than commercial fluids). He also presents an elegant center gauge that seems like a relatively easy tool to make. Lastly he shows a simple trick for marking straight parallel lines on cylinders (round bar or tubing) using just a piece of angle stock.I learned some very handy things in the "Cutting, Filing and Finishing" chapter. For example he explains why one should go slow when cutting with a hacksaw (fast strokes actually make the cut take longer, and ruin blades). He suggests mounting wooden handles on a file by heating the tang red hot and driving it into a wooden handle (that's something I've never heard of before, but I'm going to try it). He also advises the reader to avoid at all costs wire file-cleaning brushes.As a woodworker I've drilled thousands of holes using many different tools and techniques but I still managed to learn some useful things in the "Drills and Drilling" chapter. I've never had very good results using chain drilling, but I learned what I've been missing in this chapter (my most significant shortcoming was using just one size of drill bit, rather than two). For those who have access to a metal lathe, the author shows how to make counter bores, D-bits (for flat bottomed holes) and accurate reamers. I was surprised to learn how a center punched hole tends to push the drill bit off-center which reduces accuracy.The Lathe chapter gives a reasonable overview of the machine and it's uses. (I went on to purchase Mr. Bray's book "The Compact Lathe" -- see my positive review of that book here on amazon if you are interested).I found the final two chapters, covering "Milling" and "Tool Sharpening" a bit too short for my liking, almost as if the author had exceeded the publisher's page limit, or perhaps run out of time. The author departs from the style established in the first three quarters of the book where he gives advice and explains why the reader should follow it. In these final two chapters the author tends more towards simply giving the advice (for example he states "a scriber should never be sharpened on a grind wheel" and leaves it to the reader to guess why not).However, despite the last two abbreviated chapters, the majority of the book is excellent and thus I still recommend it as a good overview and introduction to metalworking.PS: Please note this book does not include measured drawings or step-by-step instructions for shop-made tools. The author assumes (quite reasonably) that a diagram or clear color photo of the tool (often in use) is enough information for the reader to construct his own copy.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,November 27, 2009,1861265735,Metalworking Tools and Techniques,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861265735,Crowood Press,$45.04
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Details, Specs, Impressions of Moshi Vortex Headphones,Review of Moshi Vortex Premium In-Ear Headphones for Kindle Fire HDSummary (Short) Review:These headphones sound very good to my mid-fifty year-old ears. They are high quality, have braided wires, come with 4 different sized ear adapters, and an interesting silicone rubber case that feels like soft leather. Buyers who are undeterred by the price will be well satisfied with these earphones.Detailed (Long) Review:The product name of these earphones is "Moshi Vortex Premium In-Ear Headphones for Kindle Fire HD", however in reading the enclosed documentation it seems they are actually designed for the Apple iOS devices (iPhones, iPods, iEtc...), and that the Kindle Fire HD was built to be compatible with these Apple devices. That's okay, as it means Amazon was smart enough to adhere to the defacto headphone standard when designing the Kindle HD. It also means that any other phones marketed towards Apple products ought to work with Kindles.The packaging is pretty much frustration free as long as you've got a knife or scissors handy to slit the two marked locations at the top of the box. After that slide it open, and pop out the contents.The gold-plated plug fits well in a my 8.9" Kindle HD, which is enclosed inside Amazon's leather case (I mention this because not all headphone plugs work well with the Kindle leather case).The high quality braided cord is 54 inches long (from the tip of the plug to the earphone), and has a slider tab to adjust the length of the separated wires.The silicone rubber case has a textured surface that feels sort of like fine leather. It does a good job of holding / protecting the earphones and completely encloses the wire and plug. One minor gripe with it is that it takes quite a few turns to wind the wire on.Most people should be able to get a very good fit as there are 4 pairs of adapters included. There are three different sizes of dome-shaped silicone rubber tips, and one pair of thicker (memory foam rubber) cylindrical shaped tips. I was able to get a good fit with both the cylindrical tips and one of the dome-shaped tips.Noise isolation is moderate. With the music playing at two-thirds volume I could not hear moderate sounds around me (voices, etc.). With the music paused I could easily converse with someone.There is a "MIC" button which may be used to Pause/Play the Kindle. This mostly works, except when one is using the Kindle Silk browser (when it has no effect - perhaps a software bug?). This button apparently has additional functions on Apple devices.The phones seem a bit heavy, especially compared to other, cheaper products. After wearing them for a few minutes I became used to the weight and did not notice any discomfort whatsoever.The sound drivers are efficient enough that my Kindle Fire HD (8.9") gave me all the loudness I wanted when set at about three-quarters volume. I am no audiophile, and not really qualified to rate the sound quality of these phones in any objective way. Also, sound quality is very subjective - your impressions will almost certainly vary from mine. I listened to a variety of artists including Sister Machine Gun, A3, Adele, Norah Jones, Alan Parsons, Roxy Music, RATM, .... and found for the most part the headphones performed very well. When I detected some muddiness in the bass I re-listened to the track using a pair of Sennheiser 202 headphones and found it also sounded muddy on them, so I cannot fault the Moshi's for that. As I stated elsewhere, these earphones sound very good to me.I did not test the microphone function.At present this web page provides scant detail about the product. For those who like to know this stuff, here are the specifications from the included documentation:o 3.5 mm plug follows Apple wiring standard (4 conductor, appears to be gold plated)o Integrated MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphoneo Neodymium drivers, range 10Hz - 20 kHz / -10dB @ 1kHzo Impedance: 18 Ohmso Noise isolation (passive): up to 23 dBo Sensitivity: 100 +/-3 dB @ 1kHzo The three silicone dome ear tips have the following diameters: 11.1 mm (S), 12.3 mm (M), 13.6 mm (L)o Cable length: 1.2m.Disclosure:I received this product for free, in exchange for writing this review.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Useful, High Quality Pry Bar,Review of Vaughan B215L SuperBar, 21-Inch LongI bought a cheap 15 inch knock-off of this tool from Harbor Freight a few years ago just to see if this form of pry bar would be useful to me. It has been.With a big siding-removal project in the works I decided to invest in a better quality version, and get something just a bit longer. Turns out it was a very good decision. The quality of this tool is far superior to the HF knock-off. As another reviewer mentioned, the ends and nail pulling slot are nicely ground. Seems like it's made with higher quality steel as well, since this 21 inch bar is not much heavier than the knock-off even though it's 40% longer. It's a very good size and weight for removal of plastic siding, easy to carry with me up and down the ladder all day. Quite good at nail pulling, although there are specialized nail pullers available that will do a better job in really tough situations.Helpful tip: I hang this bar from my work belt using a small steel hook (riveted to the right side of the belt), to keep my hands free for other tasks (like holding on to the the ladder :-) ). So far it's worked like a charm, the bar has not fallen off once in may weeks of use.Having experienced the quality difference between this well made tool (USA) and the Asian knock-off I would buy the Vaughan again in a heartbeat.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,1,Tedious, mind-numbing, and boring,I did not purchase this book - I received it at no charge on the understanding that I would review it here on amazon. Sadly, this is not going to be a happy review.It's not clear exactly what the author is trying to do or say here. I presume she is attempting to show how sketching is used by architects to produce designs and ultimately buildings. However the author's indirect writing style and over-use of quotations makes it impossible to know for certain.I did find some parts of the book interesting - the nature and use of "play" in creative pursuits, for example - but the author does a poor job of showing how this relates to sketches, or how the knowledge might be used to improve one's sketches. I reached the end of the book having been forced to digest a huge number of quotations from the works of other authors, frustrated that few of quotations relate to the subject of sketches.If you want to learn about sketches and drawings there are far better books out there.In summary, this book fails to provide much information on it's stated subject, it is tedious, mind-numbing and - worst of all - boring.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,August 5, 2009,0750682264,Architects' Sketches,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0750682264,Routledge,$180.00
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,smooth cutting bit,This is a review of Freud 19-102 7/16-Inch Diameter Dish CarvingRouter Bit with 1/4-Inch Shank. Due to an amazon web glitch itseems to be posted under other router bits as well - sorry forany confusion.I've owned this bit for a few months and have found it to bewell balanced and smooth cutting. I've used it in 120V andbattery poweredrouters with good results. (The battery routeris actually an 18V Bosch Rotozip.)The diameter and radius makes it appropriate for smaller scale work(most other dish cutters have 1/4" radius rather than 1/8" as thisone does).Another benefit of the small size is that it works well freehandby not tending to force the router off-side too much, as long asthe cuts are not too deep.Like most Freud cutters, it is not inexpensive,but it is worth the price.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 18, 2008,B00004T7DR,Freud 19-102 7/16-Inch Diameter Dish Carving Router Bit with 1/4-Inch Shank,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004T7DR,Freud,$25.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,High Quality Bit, Works well in Plastic, Metal, Wood,This Irwin 10232 Unibit is a high quality set step drill, made in the USA. While it does cost more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.The Good:Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood.Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. No counterpunch or pre-drilling required to achieve accuracy.The shank is formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review).Markings are highly visible and easy to read.The quality workmanship of this product is obvious: sharp, finely machined, highly visible markings.The Bad:There really isnt anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bit had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).Summary:If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.If you like short reviews - stop here!On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on The bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #2 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.Irwin Unibit #2:Irwin Item #: 10232Hole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2Step increment: 3/8Number of steps: 6Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8Overall Length: 3-1/8Shank Size Across flats: 1/4Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4I happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.When is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?When drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced.Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.When a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit.Its possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes.If you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 wider starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered.Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).A single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.When is a standard metal drill bit better?When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece.In thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just arent designed to do this.Other details and observations:Use step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical.Enlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged.You can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole.I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.One review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.In hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.If you would like to see more images of bits, test cuts, and so on, please see my review of the Irwin 10225 Unibit set.I hope you found this information useful. If so your feedback would be much appreciated.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 24, 2015,B00004THYY,Irwin Tools UniBit 3/16-Inch to 1/2-Inch Step-Drill Bit, 1/4-Inch Shank (10232),Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004THYY,IRWIN,$10.43
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,versatile, well designed tool kit,Where I'm coming from:I've owned this Metabo Powermaxx Plus kit for about 6 weeks, and so far am very pleased with it.I do a lot of cabinet work, using smaller caliber screws, often working in tight spaces.I am very familiar with battery powered drills and drivers - I started out using a low cost Black and Decker screwdriver many years ago, and have moved up to Makita, Bosch and Dewalt products in the past few years.I carefully compared this device to the Bosch PS20 pocket driver and the PS10 i-driver before purchasing. I chose it because it is smaller, lighter and feels better in the hand.The Bosch devices have larger capacity batteries, but in practice I find the Powermaxx has enough power to drive many, many fasteners between charges.Pros:o ergonomics are excellent. Very light, comfortable, precise speed control, and easy to use forward/reverse switch. Fits in my hand very nicely.o build quality is excellent. It's hard to adequately explain the fine fit and finish of this device - the magnetic bit holder is so precisely machined that bits make a kind of sucking sound when they are withdrawn, the angle attachment slides on easy with a perfect fit and absolutely no play, and so on.The quality is superior to any other brand of tool I own (Bosch, Makita, Dewalt, ...).o battery life is very good. I have not tested the endurance by counting screws driven but I have no reason not to believe the claim of hundreds of screws per charge.o torque control can be set quite low for delicate situations (manual states 4.4 in. lbs.) but ranges up to a respectable 31.0 in. lbs. For max torque you lock out the clutch. The manual says it will do 44 in. lb. "soft" and up to 80 in. lbs. "hard" I think means motor turning and stalled respectively.o If you need still more torque the automatic spindle lock allows you to manually rotate the tool (manual says 133 in. lbs. maximum).o comes in a nice case (I mostly toss away tool cases, but for now at least I'm keeping this one).o very compact device, allows it to work in tighter spaces than other drivers. And when things get really tight there is also the angle driver attachment.Cons:I have no major complaints. However, as good as it is, nothing in this world is perfect and the Powermaxx is no exception, so here are a few minor quibbles:o battery charging time is just under 2 hrs. Quite respectable, and the 2nd battery makes this easy to live with as I've never used it up before the other one was recharged. However, I've been spoiled by Makita and Bosch which recharge in 1 hr, and 30 minutes respectively.o gear changer is a little weird (maybe because of the planetary gear mechanism). The manual suggests you should change gears with the motor turning, which is just the opposite of all my other drivers. I've found this works best using a slow speed, and no load. This isn't really a problem, just something a little different from the norm.o It would be nice if it had a built-in LED light. My Makita impact driver has one, and every now and then I am quite thankfull for it.o magnetic hex-bit holder is so powerful that I find it difficult to withdraw the shorter one inch bits by hand. I can do it, but it's tough on the fingers - so usually I just grab the bit with my pliers. I have not tried this yet, but I suspect I could wad a thin piece of paper in the bit holder to cure this. Also, bits longer than one inch are no problem to remove by hand.Other Details:I haven't used the drill chuck for anything other than a few test holes but it's obviously a sturdy, high quality component just like the rest of this kit. With a 600 rpm top step, drilling was not the primary function I had in mind when I bought this tool.The Powermaxx is smaller than the product description on this web page says. With the driver tip installed it measures 5-1/2 inches from the tip to the back end. It measures 6 inches from the top of the back end to the bottom of the handle. The thickness of the top part is 1-3/4 inches (motor and clutch mechanism) while the handle thickens to 2-1/4" at the base of the battery. Measuring on the diagonal it's just under 8 inches from the tip of the bit holder to the bottom of the handle/battery.With the angle driver attached, it measures 7-1/4 inches from the tip to the back end. It's about 1 inch from the driver tip to the back of the head, but this increases to 1-3/8 inches by the time you move back 2 inches from the tip. Suffice it to say the angle driver can fit in some fairly tight spaces. Because the angle driver is fastened to the tool, it takes only one hand to drive screws. Compare this to add-on devices (like the Milwaukee) which require two hands, because they don't fasten to your driver - making them much less useful.Note that the above measurements are with no hex bit installed - a one inch driver bit adds 1/2" to the overall length.With the drill chuck installed, and fully extended the device measures just under 7-1/2 inches from the tip to the back end (ie jaws fully closed). With the jaws fully open the measurement is just under 7 inches.While I have used this driver on up to #10 x 3" screws, that was a tight situation where other tools just would not fit. It's really most appropriate for use on #8 and lower screws. After all, it's only a 6 watt hour tool (4.8v times 1.25 amp hrs). If I'm going to be driving a lot of big and/or long screws I reach for my Makita driver with over 37 watts of power and an impact mechanism that amplifies its driving capabilities.If you keep your expectations reasonable you'll be very happy with the performance of this finely crafted tool.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,August 13, 2007,B000CE9YJC,Metabo PowerMaxx Plus 4.8-Volt Cordless  Drill/Screwdriver Kit,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9YJC,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,worth it,I've had this tool for about 3 months, and used it on one major project, recovering valuable wood from some old upholstered chairs.In short, it works well, even better than I expected for such an inexpensive device. Used according to the directions it finds nails easily, and if your thorough, will even find skinny little upholstery staples.The device seems well made, I expect it will last a long time.I estimate it's already paid for itself in a single project when I compare it's cost to that of planer, router and saw blades that would otherwise have been damaged.If you work with reclaimed wood you probably need one of these (or the more expensive model if you do lot's of reclaimation).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,February 4, 2006,B00005NMUO,Wizard Detectors 24902 Little Wizard II Metal Detector,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NMUO,Wizard Distribution,$24.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,High Quality Set, More Useful Than You May Think,This Irwin 10225 Unibit product is high quality set of step drills, made in the USA, that comes in a substantially padded protective case. While it does cost significantly more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.The Good:Thickly padded, zippered blue case.Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood.Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole.Two of the four bits have shanks formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review).Markings are highly visible and easy to read.The quality workmanship of this product is obvious. Finely machined, highly visible markings, and a beautiful storage case.The Bad:There really isnt anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking the two smaller sized bits can be a bit difficult to extract from their padded slots in the case. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).The smaller two bits fit standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal. This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bits had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance in my testing.Price:This is an expensive set of bits - it costs more than my first drill press did! If you wish to experience these high quality bits at a lower cost, there may just be a way to do so. Simply do what we all love to do on amazon - shop around!A quick amazon search of Irwin Unibit&#34; reveals that the price of these bits is largely related to their size - for example the largest bit (#4) is roughly half the cost of the entire set. If all you need is one of the smaller two bits, either can be had for under 16 dollars with prime shipping. If you can live without the largest bit, a set of three can be had for about 43 dollars (there is no case, and the third bit is slightly different than the set reviewed here, but seems comparable).Ive posted a price-comparison chart in the photos accompanying this review.Of course this information is only current as of the posting date of my review, as prices can, and probably will change in time.Summary:If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.If you like short reviews - stop here!On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on The 4 bits in this set are labelled Irwin Unibit 1, 2, 4 and 21. The three smaller bits are self starting, and the forth is for enlarging. All these bits can be purchased individually here on amazon.com.All have hex shanks for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Fresh Perspective On Routers,I suspect Mr. Kirby is a disciple of Stunk and White (The Elements of Style). He explains the wood working router, it's uses and limitations, in a clear, direct, and brief manner. Rather than giving long-winded, highly detailed descriptions of specific jigs he focuses on general principals that can be applied to solve many problems. This style can be upsetting for those who are used to more traditional wood working books that give detailed plans complete with materials lists and measurements making it possible to saw, drill, and assemble jigs with minimal thinking required of the reader (if you prefer this style of book, I recommend Bill Hylton's excellent works).I learned a great deal from Mr. Kirby's book, and because of the general nature of his ideas I found I have been able to apply his techniques in other areas of craft as well (such as quickly assembling simple jigs for construction purposes, which are rather different from the fine work the book covers).Mr. Kirby is clearly a master of his craft.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Still working well after one year of moderate use,I purchased this battery to replace aging BAT181 Bluecore batteries for my Bosch tools about one year ago.

It has not been used moderately during the past year, probably recharged 3 or 4 dozen times.It is a bit lighter, than the original batteries, but also rated to hold a few less amp hours (2.2 versus 2.6).Frankly I am surprised (and pleased) that it has endured, considering the original Bluecore batteries were NiCads, while this is NiMh, and is charged in the original Bosch 30 minute charger.Fits into my tools very well, every bit as good as the original batteries.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,3,embarrassingly simply minded plot,Until recently, I've very much enjoyed Joe Buff's books (and I've read them all). The near-future setting allowed him to explore some terrifying and fascinating ideas about limited nuclear warfare. However, his last two books have been based on plots that are increasingly hard to believe, even in fiction such as this. In particular, Seas of Crisis has a plot that is simply not believable. I'm not going to reveal anything to spoil the story here - obviously others have enjoyed this particular work - but if you're new to Joe Buff's novels, I recommend you start at the beginning and read his earliest, and best novels. Then, if you simply must have more, go ahead and read this - but you've been warned, the plot is as corny and improbable as they come.--- Update, December 2010 ----In re-reading my review, it is clear to me that it is too harsh, so I haveupgraded the rating by one star, and apologized to Mr. Buff (see comments).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 4, 2007,0060594713,Seas of Crisis,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060594713,HarperTorch,$0.01
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,A Most Pleasant, Intuitive Dimmer Switch,Review of Lutron MAW600H-WH Maestro DimmerI have installed and used many different makes of dimmer switches. The Lutron Maestro is the best I have seen for a number of reasons.It is the most pleasant and intuitive dimmer I've ever used. The gentle fade-in and fade-out when simply turning the lights on and off is worth the price even if you never dim your lights. (It is possible to use it as a simple on-off switch in just this way, if you wish).The delayed turn-off feature is intuitive, and practical. I use this feature every day when leaving the living room to head upstairs, and in the bedroom to give me time to get into bed before the lights go out.The Maestro comes with an improved cover plate, that hides the screws you see on a standard plate. This is a nice touch, and it does look better, but it's not the main reason I love these dimmers. Note you can still use this dimmer with a standard cover plate if you desire.Most dimmers make a faint humming sound, that is most noticeable when set to the dimmest light level. While the Lutron also hums, ever so faintly, it is most quiet brand of dimmer I have experienced.By the way, most people will never notice this sound (in the Lutron or even other louder dimmers). I just happen to have very sensitive ears. For those of you that hear this hum, you can minimize it by installing the lowest wattage bulbs that are acceptable (in other words, don't put in a 100 watt bulb if you are always going to dim it way down to the equivalent of say 20 watts, use a 60 or 40 watt bulb and you will get less hum dimming it to 20 watts).I have found these dimmer switches to be about average as far as installation goes - no better and no worse than any other dimmer, and just a tiny bit more trouble than installing a basic on-off switch (because the switch body of the Lutron - and any other dimmer switch - is more bulky than a simple on-off switch).I recommend you try out the "demo" provided on this web page as it gives a reasonably accurate example of how the features of this switch will work. You can try out the delayed off feature, as well as others using your mouse to simulate tapping the switch.My wife was quite skeptical when I bought our first Lutron Maestro, thinking they were just an expensive gadget. Now she is a convert, and insists on Lutrons for every often used light in the house. Thus far, we've installed 8 of these (and counting...). We even use them to control some of our outside lights.If you are sensitive to ergonomics, and lighting, I highly recommend this dimmer switch.------- End of review, some thoughts about efficiency following -----By the way, with regards to energy efficiency, some have pointed out that one ought to use smaller bulbs, or even fluorescent bulbs. Others have implied that a dimmer "wastes" power by shunting energy to a resistor. Unfortunately, energy efficiency is not as simple as some people think it is.First, the good news. You may rest assured modern dimmers do not waste much power at all, indeed they are almost 100% efficient. Also, the more a light is dimmed, the less energy it consumes.Almost all the energy that is "wasted" by a common incandescent bulb is converted into heat. This means during the heating season a light bulb does not waste any energy at all because every bit of heat produced offloads your standard heating equipment (in other words you furnace doesn't have to run as much). This is a happy situation, since incandescent bulbs produce some of the best quality light you can get, especially halogen bulbs (which I highly recommend). Lastly, bulbs last much longer when they are run at reduced brightness (which reduces bulb replacement cost). So, in summary, during the heating season all your energy will be put to good use, regardless of how inefficient your lighting is. Just enjoy.Now for the bad news. During the non-heating season, when excess heat is undesirable, the low efficiency of incandescent bulbs is a problem. An incandescent bulb that puts out 4% of it's energy as light, and the other 96% as heat isn't such a good idea. You may actually be paying twice for the inefficiency if you are running air conditioning since your AC will have to run longer to absorb the excess heat from your light bulbs. This nasty effect is reduced by the fact that the non-heating season coincides with longer hours of daylight, so you won't need to use your lights as much. Lastly, as you dim a bulb, it becomes less efficient (that is the amount of light per watt drops).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 4, 2010,B000BPCWQE,Lutron MAW600H-WH Electronics Maestro Duo Dimmer, White single pole switch,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPCWQE,Lutron,$27.98
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Adds Impressive Capability to Dimmer Switches (Sunrise/Sunset off/on) and more,The smart bridge app allows control of one or more dimmer switches via one's phone or tablet.A very handy feature is turning lights on/off based on sunrise and sunset times. I currently use a simple timer to turn my outdoor lights on, but have to reprogram the time 4 or 5 times during the year as the daylight hours change. The Smart Bridge has a better way. Allow the app to access your location (because sunrise/sunset varies depending on where you live) and you never have to program the on/off times again.You aren't stuck with choosing simply sunset as the on time. The app lets you do this up to 2 hours before or after sunset. Ditto for sunrise.When exactly is sunrise/sunset? It seems that the app uses the same times as the built-in weather app in my iPhone.The app is fairly easy to use, and intuitive. It does have a few "rough edges": it uses pop up dialogs where a more subtle interaction would suffice, it runs only in portrait mode, there is no iPad specific mode (it looks like a super-sized iPhone app), but everything does work, and I expect it will improve steadily as time goes on.I was curious to see how robust this system is, and learn where the "brains" actually reside. Once you program your devices, will they still work if the internet is down? The answer is, happily, Yes! Internet connectivity is not required for timed on/off events to work. The "brains" seem to reside in the smart bridge. If the bridge loses power, and a timed event occurs before power is restored, the associated switches and dimmers miss the event. This isn't really so bad, because presumably if the smart bridge is without power, so is the rest of your house.Another test I performed was to momentarily interrupt power to the smart bridge for 1 minute, and then restore it, simulating a brief power outage. In this case, the smart bridge *misses* the next timed event, even if that event occurs many minutes after power is restored. After this first missed event, things start working again, and all subsequent events trigger as you would expect. This seems to be a minor bug, which I expect the Lutron developers will correct eventually.When you are away from home the app lets you see what your dimmer switches are doing. It will tell you if they are off or on. And if on, it will tell you the brightness level they are set to (as a percent). It's kind of cool to be able to know if anyone at home is using the lights. Lutron has been making Maestro occupancy sensors for years, and so it seems inevitable that they will soon come out with Caseta versions. This could give the app the information it needs to warn you that someone is in your house. But we will have to wait and see on this.I was out walking my dogs, miles away from home, and just for fun pulled out my iPhone and turned the light on to 75% brightness. Sure enough, when I arrived home the light was on, as I had requested. This is very cool, and possibly even useful in some circumstances.The smart bridge also claims to be able to control electric window shades and certain Honeywell thermostats. However I do not own any of these products and so am unable to test this feature.The bridge is a small white plastic rectangle, 1-3/16" high by 2-3/4" wide by 2-3/4" deep. The back side of the cube has three items: a micro USB connection, an ethernet connection, and an undocumented switch (presumably a reset button).I was curious about what the cost of powering this gadget would be over the course of a year. The cube states its power draw is 300 mA at 5 V, which works out to 1.5 watts. I measured the 120V amperage using two different meters, averaged the readings, and came up with 0.9 watts. This works out to an annual electrical cost of $1.00 to $1.70 per year (assuming $0.13 per kw-hr, the US average). Presumably users will easily be able to recoup this energy cost by using the smart features of this device.When powered, the cube emits a white glow via thin LEDs on three of its four sides. Without the app I cannot determine yet if there is a way to disable this potentially annoying light.The smart bridge comes complete with all necessary cables. The power supply is a white plastic case about 2-3/8" wide, 1" high that protrudes 1-1/2" out from the wall socket. It is rated at 1000 mA at 5 V (5 watts). It has a 72" long cable terminating in a micro USB connector that plugs into the smart bridge cube. The 36" long ethernet cable connects your router to the cube.========= Update: Dec 17, 2014 ===============================================I was asked a question about device control when the internet provider's modem goes down. Since I now have both the Belkin WeMo Maker and the Lutron Caseta system I decided to test and compare both of them in various scenarios, to see if they can be controlled via an iPhone. Here is what I discovered:TEST............................................................................Belkin WeMo............Lutron Caseta---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Unplug ethernet between Smart Bridge and router............N/A..........................NO2. No AC power to Modem & router.....................................NO...........................NO3. No internet connection (Modem & router powered)...........YES..........................NOA YES in the table above indicates the device can be controlled from my iPhone.My cable modem & router are integrated into a single device, so am unable to power these down separately.Both the Lutron dimmer, and the Belkin WeMo can be controlled locally (via their hardware switches) during any of the tests above.The WeMo may be a preferred choice if your application requires phone or tablet control in absence of an internet connection.===========================================================================,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,November 26, 2014,B00L5NUT16,Lutron L-BDG-WH Caseta Wireless Smart Bridge, White,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L5NUT16,Lutron,$119.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,2,unpleasant little rodent,This could have been a great mouse.Instead it's so frustrating to use that I am returning it(thank you amazon, for your fair and reasonable return policy).What I like about the V450:o nice size and shape, feels good in the hando compact USB receivero major buttons (left, right) and scroll wheel are very smooth and pleasant to use.What I hate about this mouse:o movement response time is inconsistent. Sometimes it is very responsive - you move the mouse and the cursor moves appropriately. Other times there is a distinct lag - you move the mouse and nothing happens for the first few inches of travel. I find this very frustrating,and inaccurate.o wheel response time is also inconsistent. This is similar to the above complaint, except sometimes it goes into a state where you can move the wheel 1 click forward and back repeatedly with zero corresponding movement in your application. Another exceeding irritating problem.o middle button requires far too much pressure to activate. If you use this button often you are going to hate this mouse. It takes much more pressure to activate than the other mice around my office do (2 Microsoft, a Dell, and a corded Logitech).o buggy driver software. I originally installed the included drivers (and updated them via the internet) as this is necessary to allow use of the side scrolling buttons. The software is poorly designed so that some features (button use) are set in the Logitech Setpoint program, but othermouse attributes (acceleration, sensitivity) are set in a different program. I could live with that, but the drivers make the already poor performance even worse.Strangely, I purchased this cordless mouse to replace an aging corded Logitech which I like very much. I merely wanted to unclutter my desk by eliminating the cord.For now I'm going back to my old Logitech mouse.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,March 3, 2008,B000GABCY2,Logitech V450 Cordless Laser Mouse,Electronics,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GABCY2,Logitech,$11.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,makes my cordless saw young again...,This blade works very well in my Bosch 18V circular saw.In fact, the saw was performing so poorly, that I was on theverge of giving up on it, until I discovered this blade.The saw was binding, slowing down, and sometimes stoppingcompletely when attempting cuts in 2x8 and 2x6 fir lumber.It would make maybe four or five cuts on a fully charged battery.I tried two different, brand new blades (one of them by Bosch)and got the same dismal performance.On a whim, I decided to give this Freud D0624X Diablo a try,hoping that the non-stick coating would improve things.In a word, Wow!The difference is like night and day.I can now make at least two dozen cuts before recharging the battery(in 2x8 lumber). The saw no longer feels sluggish and underpowered.I'm sure there are other good brands of saw blade out there-- after all I've only tried three of them - but this particular Freudblade exceeded my expectations considerably.Hope this helps other cordless circular saw owners.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,October 16, 2007,B00008WQ2P,Freud D0624X Diablo 6-1/2-Inch 24-Tooth ATB Framing Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WQ2P,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,A Good Bargain Set,I purchased this set to have on hand for those relatively rare occasions when I am working on tiny projects that exceed the ability of my needle nose pliers. Considering the cost is less than 4 dollars per tool, I did not expect perfection. And I did not get it.When first used, a black oily substance appears around the joint. This is easily wiped off and no big deal. I expect this will be self-correcting given a little more use.I found all the jaws align fairly well - certainly good enough to be functional. The end nippers are effective as long as one does not exceed their capacity (youll need regular sized ones too I suspect!). The case is pretty good quality, especially considering the budget cost.One of the pliers has a slight problem in that the spring doesnt always open the jaws as it should. It seems that the tiny pair of leaf springs is slightly misaligned. Its not a big enough deal for me to return the set, and I expect I can correct it with a little fiddling some day (a great job for the other mini-pliers in the set!).If you are a heavy user of small scale pliers, you may wish to spend more and get more quality. However, if you are an occasional or light-duty user, this inexpensive set seems like a great bargain.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 7, 2015,B001KZH78W,General Tools & Instruments 938 Technician's Mini Plier Set, 8-Piece,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZH78W,General Tools,$25.76
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,2,Good Except For One Fatal Flaw,Review of Kinivo BTK330 Bluetooth Wireless KeyboardI have an Apple wireless bluetooth keyboard that I like very much. I don't use it with my iPad as much as I would like because it is usually living upstairs with my Mac. When I am downstairs it is just a bit too much effort to go and get it. So, after reading the glowing reviews about the Kinivo keyboard (and I admit, being seduced by the attractive price), I decided to give it a try with my iPad.At first glance the keyboard looks very nice and reasonably well put together. The two AAA batteries installed easily and securely. Keys feel okay, not as good as the Apple, but certainly adequate for a secondary keyboard. I had no problem initially pairing the keyboard with the iPad using the ESC-K key combination as described in the included documentation.The Kinivo board is identical in length, but slightly less wide than the Apple because the rounded portion of the Apple keyboard is tucked under the Kinivo. Nice design, with the on-off button securely tucked away on the bottom.Weight is similar, based on holding each in my hands, with the Kinivo being just a tad lighter (rather surprising since the Apple keyboard with it's metal case "looks" like it should weigh substantially more).Keyboard layout is a little weird. If the keys did not have labels, one could say that key sizes and layout are identical to the Apple. Unfortunately when the labels are considered some keys have been moved around. The special purpose Fn keys are a bit strange, but this is no big deal, as they are not often used, and hey you do get a Home key, a Sleep key, and other good stuff that the Apple keyboard lacks.However, if you value your muscle memory, you will not be impressed with the location of the first four keys on the bottom row (Ctrl/FN/Cmd/Option instead of the Apple standard of FN/Ctrl/Option/Cmd). The two keys to right of space bar have similar non-compatible arrangement (Option/Del rather than standard Cmd/Option). This really hurts, as these are keys I use frequently. But still, I can live with this as it is a secondary, inexpensive keyboard.As expected for a budget keyboard the keys do not feel as good as those on the Apple. They have less travel, and I find myself making a lot of annoying typing mistakes:(1) sometimes I press a key and it does not seem to have registered, resulting in missing characters.(2) at other times I get double key presses when I could swear I only typed one character.Of course this is a rather subjective observation, your mileage may well vary. Perhaps it is because I am so used to the Apple keyboard and have not yet adapted to this new one.The pairing key code, ESC-K, is unfortunately not very intuitive (I fixed this with a post-it taped to the back of the keyboard. Inelegant, but effective.) The Apple keyboard is easily and smoothly connected and disconnected between the iPad. iPhone and other devices with no secret key codes needed. Connecting and disconnected the Kinivo is a bit more trouble prone and glitchy, often requiring the use of the ESC-K combination, followed by the four digit code, to achieve the same result. If you to use this keyboard on multiple devices, the Kinivo's awkward connection ability could become tedious.Were my review to end here, my advice would be "on a good day you get what you pay for". Considering the low price of this board you should expect to put up with a few quirks, and be happy you are having a good day.Unfortunately, there is one more problem with the Kinivo - a big one - that gives me the distinct feeling it wasn't such a good day after all.The problem is this board goes to sleep after about 50 seconds. Once asleep, it takes a second or two to wake up again and re-establish it's connection, causing the first few characters typed to be lost. Until using this Kinivo, I had no idea how frequently I took 50 second breaks from my typing. It is now all too painfully clear to me.If you are paying attention, you can see when the Kinivo decides to take a power nap (pun intended). The tiny bluetooth symbol at the top right of the iPad screen goes dim. Simultaneously, the onscreen keyboard pops up if you are in Notes, Mail, or anyplace that uses a keyboard.The Apple keyboard suffers from none of these problems, not after 50 seconds, or even after 10 minutes (that's when I stopped testing, it probably carries on correctly after much much longer). There is a slight partial-second lag as the Apple awakens, but it somehow manages to capture every single key with 100% reliability.I tried this Kinivo with my iPad 4, my iPhone 5, and my Apple TV. Unsurprisingly, it seems to work identically, quirks and all, with each device.Based on the Kinivo's frequent power naps, and it's clumsy, irritating recovery, I cannot recommend this keyboard for anything but the most infrequent use (perhaps driving your Apple TV). For use with iPads and certainly Macs, you'd best pony up the dollars for the real Apple keyboard. The reduction in blood pressure is easily worth the difference.Regards,Joe MooneyP.S. If Kinivo fixed the power napping problem, I would boost my review to 4 stars. Remapping the keys to match Apple's would earn a full 5 stars.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 24, 2013,B00A6J4WHW,Kinivo BTK330 Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard for iPad, iPhone, Android, and other tablets (Requires two AAA batteries - not included),MP3 Players & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A6J4WHW,Kinivo,$9.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Worth Reading,This is a good, solid, thoroughly enjoyable novel of the military / techno-thriller genre.I won't get into the plot details - it's been covered by other reviewers already, plus I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.I did not find it impossible to put down, but I did find it interesting enough that I found myself reading a chapter or more at each sitting over the span of a week or so. The pacing of the novel was excellent - I started by reading just a few chapters each day, but as I neared the final third of the book I was hooked into finishing it in one sitting. Perhaps it was just my mood, but it seemed the authors managed to hit their stride, combining action, suspense, and even a little humor into a satisfying ending (well, ending in the sense that I definitely intend to read the next of this four part series).In summary, a worthwhile diversion - recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,October 13, 2009,0765321378,Larry Bond's Red Dragon Rising: Shadows of War,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765321378,Forge Books,$0.01
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,perfect if used with an IMPACT DRIVER,I've owned this chuck for a few years now, and am very pleased with it.It is very well made. With a little practice it is a slick, quick, sturdy chuck.If my memory serves me correctly, this item is intended to be used with an IMPACT DRIVER.To load a bit properly requires the following steps:1. insert the bit and loosely tighten the chuck by hand2. wrap you hand around the chuck, grasp it medium tight and power up your impact driver. This locks the bit securely in the chuck and is essential to proper operation.3. Drill and drive to your heart's content.I have never had any slippage problems when using the above technique.If you use this chuck enough to develop some skill you can often save sometime by performing steps 1 & 2 together using the spin from your impact driver.To remove the bit perform step 2 with your impact driver running in reverse.I suspect that the folks who are having problems with bit slippage or removal are not using this chuck with an impact driver, or not following the instructions provided.Although not intended for use with a drill, I find I can do so by setting the clutch to just the right level so that it clicks madly while I grasp the chuck (see step 2) to provide some sort of impact-like force (set your drill to the highest speed possible for this step).Hope this helps clarify things a bit.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,April 14, 2009,B000NDDJO8,none,none,none,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,worth it,This is the first and only drill holster I have used, so I cannot say how other brands compare. I have owned it for about 6 months.If you frequently use a rechargable drill away from your workshop I think you'll find that any holster is way, way better than having none at all. It's especially valuable if you work from ladders or in awkward places (like a sloping roof where you cannot set things down).Pros:o easily holds my 14.4V drills securely, and is large enough I would expect it to hold much bigger drills (18V and up).o the large hole in the bottom makes it possible to holster a drill with a bit installed, which is extremely helpful when working in difficult places (like my slick metal roof).o a velcro snap makes sure the drill won't fall out while climbing, bending over, and moving about. The snap can be positioned out-of-the-way when not required.o seems like it will last a long time.o being nylon it won't be ruined if exposed to water/rain.Cons:o because it is sized to hold even very large drills, it seems a bit too big when used with smaller drills (say 9.6 and down). It holds them fine, but just has a lot of room to spare.o Workmanship is good, but not exceptional.I was just about to purchase the Dewalt holster when I noticed this Grizzly model appeared to be almost identical while costing much less. So, cheapskate that I am, I took a chance, and bought the Grizzly product. So far I am happy with my purchase - very good value for the money.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 16, 2006,B0000DD4AR,none,none,none,none,none
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,2,poor sound isolation, other problems,I bought these Coby CVE92 earphones because they are promoted as isolation earphones, and because they have been receiving extremely good reviews here on amazon.Pros:o low cost.Cons:o sound isolation is minimal to non-existant.o sound quality is not very good - mediocre at best.o one size does not fit all - I really have to jam these things into get them to stay put. That's probably because the "soft ear cup for maximum comfort" really is not that soft. It is thin hollow plastic surrounding a hard plastic tube.These are going into the trash can, since at under six bucks it is certainly not worth my time to return them, nor would it be fair to hassle amazon.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,June 17, 2008,B000FOYMKU,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOYMKU,Coby,$15.95

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Changed the way I use my iPad,I purchased this out of curiosity, to see if it would change the way I use my iPad 4th generation. Frankly, I bought the red one (used) only because it was cheaper than the black.I now understand why so many folks love this keyboard case.The special shortcut keys are very convenient (something my Apple Bluetooth keyboard lacks).The keys are necessarily a bit cramped compared to the Apple keyboard, but that is a reasonable trade-off for the portability, and built in stand.If you expect this to protect your iPad, you will be disappointed. That is not what it is designed to do. I use a soft-sided zippered case to do that job, but only need it when travelling. For around the house this keyboard case alone is sufficient.Also, if you see the magnetic latch as simply a quick, convenient way to align and attach the keyboard you'll be happy with this. If you expect it to clamp the iPad so solidly you can be rough with it, well, you'll be disappointed and perhaps have a damaged iPad.I mount my iPad both in Portrait (tall) and Landscape (wide) modes in the slot. Landscape is a bit sturdier due to magnets and the geometry, but the portrait mode works fine as long as one is carefull. It's very convenient to be able to operate in both modes, depending on the app one is using. I tend to prefer the Portrait mode for document creation and other typing / editing tasks.By the way, my previous case was a MoKo Slim-fit which I really liked, and still use occasionally. It gives more protection but of course no keyboard.If you are interested in a high quality, innovative device that may change the way you use your iPad, this Logitech Ultrathin cover is worth your consideration.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,November 20, 2014,B00BKDJTQM,Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover Red for iPad 2 and iPad (3rd/4th generation),Computers & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKDJTQM,Logitech,$69.95

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,More Useful to a Woodworker than I expected,Most of my work is with wood, but I do some small scale metal-work and thought this might come in handy occasionally. It has. But I am surprised by how often I use this to hold small wood pieces for drilling.What makes this vise more useful than the typical bolt-down style is the squared-off sides. It allows quick alignment of workpieces in a variety of situations. For example I can lay a block in flat, then tilt the vice up on its side, and be assured Im going to drill a hole perpendicular to the end. You may also slide the vice along a fence when chain drilling a series of holes at the same offset. The precision machining and squareness are what make this possible.The perfectly smooth jaws make it possible to securely hold wood without leaving marks in it.With its 9.5 pound weight I rarely need to fasten it to the drill press table in use, as I can safely drill most holes (even in metal) holding it with just my hand. If I do need to fasten it to the table I use a couple of long reach clamps on the flat surfaces of the vice.With one small exception the vice appears to be accurately machined as promised (see dislikes). Its certainly true enough for most of the work I do.I jotted down some of the specifications and measurements of this vice on a piece of cardboard, and will post them as a photo.Whats not to like? A couple of things:The steel jaws were slightly wider than the vise body, and this made it wobble when set on its side. I scribed a line to mark the excess, removed the jaws and filed them true. It only took a few minutes, but considering this is advertised as being accurately machined I was a little disappointed.I wish the handle that controls the jaws was shorter. When the vice is fastened down to the table, you need to slide the handle back and forth as its turned to keep it from hitting. I may shorten it someday, or replace it with a knob. That would make adjustments much quicker, but of course the leverage would be less.These are minor complaints, I considered deducting a star for having to adjust the jaws, but that seems overly harsh considering this is such a nicely machined vise. Besides anyone buying a metal-working vise shouldnt find it too much trouble to apply a few swipe s of a file to the jaws :-).,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 6, 2015,B009E0E7C4,Wilton 11674 4-Inch Industrial Drill Press Vise,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009E0E7C4,WMH Tool Group,$55.93
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Very Good Cushioning, Durable Running Shoes,I am on my third pair of these running shoes, which I use for jogging mostly on gravel and forest trails. They are comfortable, durable, fit as expected, and have great cushioning and support. I especially appreciate being able to purchase the wider width version. For the longest time New Balance was my shoe of choice, but for the past few years I've been so happy with my ASICS I have become a convert.There are less expensive shoes that I've used, but they are not as well cushioned to begin with, and don't last nearly as long.Last thing, a word of advice, especially to older runners.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Very Satisfied With This 1" Hex Metal Bar,Review of 6061 Aluminum Hex Bar, 1" Across Flats, 72" LengthI bought a Taig metal lathe a few years ago, and have used it for a variety of small, simple projects. I find that in some cases Hexagonal stock is preferable to round: it locates in the chuck very securely and can be accurately re-chucked (by marking one face and one jaw); it's easy to turn the flat edges off to produce a cylinder (which is obviously what one intends with a lathe); the flat faces make it easier to secure the piece (in say a vise) for filing, cutting and further processing.But I digress.I've ordered quite a few pieces of metal from Small Parts and have been very happy with their service. As far as I can tell the metal is as advertised (e.g. the type, specifications, etc.). The pieces are usually packaged very securely ensuring the metal arrives in good condition (and most importantly for smaller diameters - not bent). Shipping is also very fast for me, being an amazon prime member.This piece was quite heavy, and very long (1" diameter x 6 feet). It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.Should the reader be one of those rare folks in need of such a specimen, I highly recommend this item.Regards,Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 18, 2013,B000HZS0U0,6061 Aluminum Hex Bar, Unpolished (Mill) Finish, T6 Temper, ASTM B221/AMS QQ-A-225, 1" Across Flats, 72" Length,Industrial & Scientific,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZS0U0,Small Parts,$74.01
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Witty, Informative, iPad Guide,Review of iPad: The Missing Manual 7th Edition, byDavid PogueI must confess that I have become a huge fan of David Pogue's Missing Manual books, since I first discovered them about 4 years ago. Some of the MM's are written by other authors, but frankly Mr. Pogue's work is the gold standard of the brand, which is why I resisted purchasing the iPad MM until this year, when Mr. Pogue took over the task of writing it. I am happy to report, I have not been disappointed.If you are a non-technical person or iPad novice this book will provide a cheerful, easy-going introduction to the vast capabilities of this amazing tablet, in a jargon free, easy to follow format. Even experienced iPad users will find tips and tricks that are otherwise very difficult to obtain from web searches or Apple documentation. While experts could conceivably discover much of what is contained in this book, it would be a poor tradeoff as the time spent on web searches and verification would far exceed the time required to simply read this book.If you are a positive, forward looking sort, then you've heard enough. This is one of the best iPad books I've come across, almost everyone will find something to like.Enough said.However, if you are a critical, cynical sort, you'll want to know what's not to like. After all, nothing is perfect. The following is for you:It seems to me that Mr Pogue has taken on a huge number of authoring commitments in the last half of 2014. He has written, or is in the process of writing/updating 4 books that I know of: his iPhone Missing Manual, his OS X Missing Manual, this iPad Missing Manual, and Pogue's Basics. The previous versions of this iPad manual were written by a different author, and it seems that Mr. Pogue has chosen to adapt his iPhone MM to create this new iPad MM, rather than simply updating the previous version. That's a reasonable approach given the vast similarities between the phone and the tablet. However, I get the impression that in the rush to produce the massive amount of content he has committed to, some errors have crept into this particular book. The good news is, most of the errors are not serious and only the most inexperienced users will have trouble with them. Also the author is strongly committed to correcting any errors that are reported, and updating subsequent releases of his books (there is also on-line errata available).All technical books have errors, and I don't find those in even this first release too serious. It's still one of the best iPad manuals you can lay your hands on that is current with the latest software release (iOS 8). It may indeed be the best manual available, but I cannot say for sure as I have not read all of them, and do not intend to do so.Note that, if you have both an iPhone and an iPad, you may wish to save yourself some precious reading time and purchase just one (either the iPad or the iPhone Missing Manual) rather than both. Because the devices are so similar, the manuals have a lot of commonality with each other. Whatever you choose, definitely consider reading one of these excellent manuals by Mr. Pogue.Regards,Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 23, 2014,B00PZ3BRKO,iPad: The Missing Manual,Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZ3BRKO,O'Reilly Media,$9.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Easy, reliable Ethernet & Internet anywhere in your house,Summary:These AV500 adapters give you an ethernet plug just about anywhere you have a wall socket. They are easy to use, fast, and have proven reliable over time. If you dont have a wall socket in the right location, just plug the AV500 into an extension cord.Pros:- dead simple to setup initially. Just plug them in, plug in your devices and it works.- very simple to engage secure mode (128 bit AES encryption). Press and hold the pairing button on each adapter, and within 60 seconds youll be in business.- reliable. Ive been using these adapters (single port version) for over a year, and had no problems even when power failures occur [see note 1]- good way to speed up internet access on older laptops and other equipment that dont have the latest WiFi circuitry.Cons:- symbols on the device are hard to read (white characters on light gray background).- no real feedback or indication that the device is indeed operating in secure mode. If would be nice if there was an indicator light that meant secure mode which could give a constant assurance to the user.Detailed Info:Whats in the box? 2 Ethernet cables, one power line adapter with 2 ethernet ports, and one power line adapter with a single ethernet port. Typically, the single port adapter would be the one you plug into your WiFi modem. You dont have to use both ports on the double adapter - it works just fine with either one or two devices plugged in. Because the adapters are so fast, you are unlikely to notice any speed degradation if you do have two devices plugged into the double unit (I certainly didnt with a Mac and PC plugged in).If you have a relatively new WiFi network and computers (using 802.11 N or better) you are unlikely to notice a speed improvement when accessing the internet using one of these AV500 adapters. I got the same 35 Mbps download test speeds on both.I have a laptop using an older WiFi setup (802.11 G) and it enjoyed significant speed improvement on internet speed tests going from 20 Mbps to 35 Mbps with the AV500.I took an AV500 adapter out to my detached workshop - its far enough away that WiFi can be a bit spotty. It has a separate power panel, that feeds from the main house panel. I found the AV500 worked surprisingly well turning in internet speed tests about the same as in the main house [see note 2].Since I already owned a few extra adapters, I tested this kit with 3 adapters all connecting at the same time, in secure mode. All the computers worked fine with no slowdowns, or hiccups.Range is specified as 300 meters (1,000+ feet) over single circuit. Thats far more than typical indoor WiFi range, which according to wikipedia is about 32 meters.Notes:[1] - on my Windows 7 machine, the internet connection occasionally stops working, about ten minutes after it comes out of sleep mode. I unplug the AV500 adapter from the wall and then plug it back in and everything starts working again. Since this same problem occurred when using a different brand of wireless adapter, I believe it is a Windows 7 issue and not a problem with the TP-Link device.[2] - in my detached workshop I did 5 internet speed tests using a different outlet for each one. One of the tests was slightly below normal at 32 Mbps, but the other 4 were 35 Mbps - exactly the same as tests performed inside the house.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,August 19, 2015,B010Q29KRK,TP-LINK TL-PA4026 KIT AV500 2-port Powerline Starter Kit, Up to 500Mbps,Computers & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Q29KRK,TP-LINK USA,$42.99

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,High Quality Product,I used to make my own pocket hole jigs. Drill a hole into a square hardwood block, cut an appropriate angle off the block, and you've got your jig. This approach gives you maximum flexibility with the angle, hole diameter and stock size. Sometimes, it's the best way to go. However, the downsides to this approach are numerous: you have to think alot (it takes some time to figure out the angle and offset), the wood jig gets sloppy after extended use and must be replaced, you need to drill twice for each hole (one countersink, and one for the screw).Enter the Kreg jig.Pros:o no thinking required (well, not about how to build the jig anyway).o easy to use.o high quality product. This is a very well made jig, built to tight tolerances. I expect it to last for a very long time.o the drill bit is also top quality - if you've only used cheap disount bits you will be very pleasantly surprised to see how this fine Kreg bit performs.o instructions are clear, short, easy to follow.o works as well as advertised. Better than I expected, actually.o great support and product information at the kreg website.Cons:o you are limited to a single angle (about 15 degrees, I seem to recall).o you are limited to a single hole width (3/8")Overall I am very pleased with this jig. It works well and is surprisingly pleasant to use.I've been using the Kreg screws with this jig and am very pleased with them - they are the same high quality as the jig. You can use other screws but make sure they are self-drilling.I use any one of a number of my shop clamps to hold things in place - they work well. I suspect the kreg clamps would work better but have not tried them, and am not inclined to do so at this time.You will need long reach robertson (square drive) screwdriver (or bit for your power driver). A 3" square drive bit with an extension will do, but a 6" bit is best. (These are available here on amazon.com, and possibly at your local hardware store.)One last thing. Used appropriately pocket holes can be quite strong and durable, whether done with a home-made jig or the kreg.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 15, 2006,B00065WPP2,Kreg MKJKIT Mini Kreg Jig Kit,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065WPP2,Kreg,$19.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Excellent Introduction to Mini Lathe Work,Review of: The Compact Lathe, Stan BrayWhere I'm coming from:I have no experience using any type of lathe. I am currently trying to decide if a small metal lathe would be a useful tool for me, and have been reading a number of books on the subject.I decided to purchase this book after being impressed with Mr. Bray's book about metalworking tools and techniques (which I hope to review soon - time permitting). The focus of this book is on small metal lathes such as the Taig (aka Peatol in Britain), Proxxon PD 230, Cowell 90, Toyo 210, and Sherline.The book is well written, easy to understand, and amply illustrated with numerous black and white photographs. The 186 page book seems quite comprehensive, covering all common lathe operations including tools, 3 and four jaw chucks, using a faceplate, tapers, drilling and boring, threading with taps and dies, screw cutting using the lathes gearing drive, graduating and dividing, turning radii, and milling. Covering so much ground the book understandably can not go into complete detail about any particular subject (after all, there are entire books dedicated to subjects such as dividing or screw cutting). However it provides enough information about each subject to show the reader what is possible, and how to get started.I was especially impressed with Mr. Bray's wonderful tips and personal opinions (he is obviously a very talented machinist). For example he feels that if he had to choose between a lathe with a three jaw self-centering chuck, and one with a four jaw independent one, "the four jaw would win hands down". He goes on to show why. One of the more clever tricks he proposes is mounting a standard lathe tool offset in the 4 jaw chuck to become a simple fly cutter. Similarly, a boring bar in the 4 jaw can be used with work mounted in the saddle (cross-slide).The author offers clever tips on just about every subject he covers. He shows a simple shop-made tool for turning ball ends, a method of deburring drill holes using just drill bits, and a very cool way to remove broken taps from brass, bronze or copper (soaking them for a few days in alum will dissolve the tap). Ever practical, his section on cutting fluids also includes advice on common household products that can be used if no proper cutting fluid is available ("butter and margarine are reasonable, and lard is excellent").The book dedicates about 14 pages to a discussion of various small metal lathes. Although the author never explicitly reveals his own personal lathe, I suspect it is the Toyo ML-210 since there are a number of photographs of that discontinued machine throughout the book (also photo's of numerous other makes as well). The author explains that the Proxxon PD 230 (currently available) is an improved version of the Toyo 210.Finally, there is a glossary of engineering / lathe terminology which I found quite interesting (primarily because the author embellishes it with helpful tips and advice. For example "backlash" takes 2/3's of a page because in addition to simply defining the term, the author explains how to measure it, and how it overcome it).So what's not to like about this book?I suppose the black and white photographs could be a little more clear (or even in color, although I'm not sure the added publishing cost would be worth it).As the author is British, there are some phrases that could be a little unclear to a North American reader ("washing-up liquid" is, I presume "dish soap", but I'm not entirely certain).But really, these are very minor shortcomings.This is an excellent book which I highly recommend.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,November 23, 2009,1854862278,Compact Lathe,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1854862278,Special Interest Model Books,$8.18

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,High Quality Bit, Works well in Plastic, Metal, Wood,This Irwin 10231 Unibit is a high quality set step drill, made in the USA. While it does cost more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.The Good:Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood.Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. No counterpunch or pre-drilling required to achieve accuracy.The shank is formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review).Markings are highly visible and easy to read.The quality workmanship of this product is obvious: sharp, finely machined, highly visible markings.The Bad:There really isnt anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bit had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).Summary:If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.If you like short reviews - stop here!On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on The bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #1 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.Iwin Unibit #1:Irwin Item #: 10231Hole Sizes: 1/8 - 1/2Step increment: 1/32ndNumber of steps: 13Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8Overall Length: 3-1/8Shank Size Across flats: 1/4Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4I happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.When is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?When drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced.Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.When a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit.Its possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes.If you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 wider starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered.Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).A single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.When is a standard metal drill bit better?When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece.In thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just arent designed to do this.Other details and observations:Use step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical.Enlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged.You can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole.I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.One review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.In hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.Always work safe and remember these wise words: DONT DRINK AND DRILL!. (I think Homer Simpson deserves credit for this, but my memory is imperfect .)I hope you found this glut of information useful.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,good inexpensive upgrade,For under 20 bucks, this keyboard is a very nice upgrade to the heavily value-engineered keyboard that comes with most computers. (In my case a Dell Quiet-key. It's actually a bit better than most stock keyboards, but still has shortcomings which I won't get into since this is a review of the Microsoft product).Pros:o keys have a nice "feel". Light touch, low travel, quiet.o although this is an ergonomic keyboard, the differences in layout and spacing are minor and easy to adjust to, yet they still offer an improvement in typing comfort.o nice spacebar, slightly deeper than standard keyboards, is easy to reach.o reasonable price for a this quality of keyboard.Cons:o size: the width is identical to my Dell Quietkey, depth is about 1 inch greater, to accomodate the extra browser-specific buttons which I don't use. If the extra buttons were generic and user programmable this item would be in the Pros category.Disclaimer - taste in input devices is highly subjective.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,A Worthwhile and Intersting Book,Review of Game Usability, edited by Isbister & SchafferThis book is a collection of essays on the subject of game usability. It provides a good overview of play testing techniques used to enhance successful games, and some ideas about how the science of usability testing is improving and evolving.I rate this book as 4 stars overall, based on the following. as an overview: 4 stars as a reference to other more detailed information: 5 stars as a detailed how-to manual: 2 stars as a generally interesting book: 5 starsI found almost all of the articles interesting, however I was most impressed with Steve Swink's passionate articles. His thoughts on input devices, the insidious danger of designer "staleness", challenge versus obfuscation were both enjoyable and educational.I learned a lot of interesting things in this book. Using "serious" games in conjunction with physiological inputs to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How the major game studios tune there games to enhance player enjoyment by managing the player's emotional cycles. Akihiro Saito's observation that the success of international Japanese game hits such as Space Invaders, Super Mario Bros. and Pokemon is due to an underlying user interface philosophy that is closely related to traditional Japanese hospitality (helping the player predict was he is supposed to do without stress).I also learned some wonderful new words: fiero (Italian) and naches (Yiddish) for which there is no suitable English equivalent. Fiero means roughly personal triumph over adversity, and the emotions that engenders. Naches is a sense of pleasure and pride when someone you help succeeds.Here is what I did not like.The focus of the book is more narrow than the title suggests. It centers on psychological issues such as measuring and testing for emotions, fun, feel and so on. I would have liked to see some discussion on mechanisms that might enhance usability. For example, what methods could be employed to allow a frustrated player to skip past a level she is stuck on (presumably with some penalty for doing so), or how about a mechanism that gives a player a hint after repeated failures in a particular level?There are more typos and grammatical errors than normal in this book. While nothing too serious, it is mildly irritating to read around these unnecessary glitches.In summary, this is a worthwhile and interesting read - recommended.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,September 21, 2009,0123744474,Game Usability: Advancing the Player Experience,Books,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123744474,CRC Press,$36.07
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Excellent mouse pad for non-gamers,After over 1-1/2 years use, I can say with some authority that this is a very good mouse pad. I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I like it. I do some gaming (FPS's mainly) but I've mostly used this for work related tasks and 2D/3D CAD on my Mac. My other PC does not have a mouse pad, and I notice (with pleasure) the difference everytime I use this pad.I find it to be very large, but not too large, as I let it droop over the side of my computer table, which makes using the mouse more comfortable due to the extra padding.Considering there are literally thousands of reviews, I won't cover any other details that have already been described elsewhere.Even if you never, ever intend to play computer games, this mouse pad may vastly increase the comfort of using your computer.Regards,Joe Mooney,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,December 16, 2014,B000UEZ36W,SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad (Black),Electronics,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UEZ36W,SteelSeries,$7.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Smil Will Make You Smile...,If you enjoy history, economics, or science, Vaclav Smil's remarkable ability to merge all three disciplines will give the reader a fresh, and fascinating perspective on the &#34;Age of Synergy&#34;, when many of the most important inventions of our current time where created.The best thing about this book is that it changed my perspective and thinking. Not just about the Age of Synergy (the period between 1867 and 1914), but about our present day and age. I find it strangely reassuring to know that another generation successfully endured, and prospered during a period of profound change.The conventional thinking of today is that we are living in a world that is changing at an ever increasing rate, never before experienced by mankind, and we are understandably stressed and anxious because of that. After reading this book, I am not so sure that is accurate - it seems the Age of Synergy shouldered much greater change.I do have to mention one shortcoming of this book. The kindle edition has a number of stupid typos, often taking the form of &#34;i.3&#34; to refer to table &#34;1.3&#34;. While nothing serious, and obviously the fault of the editor and not the author, they should not be here, as they interrupt the flow of the work. Seems to me the publisher could correct these errors and issue an update to those of use with ebooks.I shall definitely carry on and read the second book in this series (typos or not).Thank you Mr. Smil, for writing such an interesting, informative and enjoyable book!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 7, 2014,B00532P4G0,Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867-1914 and Their Lasting Impact (Technical Revolutions and Their Lasting Impact),Kindle Store,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00532P4G0,Oxford University Press,$20.29
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Good Heater For Woodworking Shop,I purchased this heater because I had good experiences with a Marvin infrared heater of similar design and capacity. The Marvin failed after many years of dependable service, and since they are no longer in business I choose this Optimus brand.I purchased my first Optimus H-9010 about a month ago, and have been so pleased with it that I purchased a second one which I installed yesterday. Here are my impressions:o The stated specification of 600/1200 Watts is incorrect or has been changed. My heaters are clearly labeled as being 750 / 1500 watts, and testing with an amp meter confirms this is about right as it draws 6.3 / 12.3 amps.o The installation is easy and convenient, the mounting bracket is long enough to straddle two studs spaced 24 on center. Mounting bolts are included.o Once mounted, the heater can be rotated through 90 degrees - that is tilted 45 degrees off vertical each way.o Build quality seems good, about the same as my original Marvin heater. Indeed, aside from the addition of the light, this Optimus seems to be the same design as the Marvin.o The unit needs to burn off a bit of factory residue, and it will stink a bit for the first 30 minutes of run time. After this period it runs clean with no smells or odors whatsoever.o The cord is a generous 82 inches. If you must use an extension cord, make sure it is at least 14 gauge and as short as possible.o The switch, activated by tugging on the convenient cord, has the following modes: (0)-Off (I)-Lamp On (II)-one quartz element glows (750 Watts) & Lamp On (III)-both quartz elements glow (1500 Watts) & Lamp Ono The light is a 25 Watt Halogen bulb with a G9 base. It swivels in up-down and left-right so it can be aimed where you want it. Of course this is too tiny a lamp to be used by itself for any serious work, but it never hurts to have extra light in ones shop. I like it, and I don't mind that it is always on while the heat is on, but if it's a problem I guess one could just remove the bulb.o Operation of the unit is completely silent, with the exception that there are some slight noises as it begins to warm up (due to metal expanding, I presume).o There is no built in thermostat, the unit is either on or off which is probably adequate for most folks. I rigged up a wall mounted thermostat that powers a ceiling socket, so I can set the heat to any desired temperature (typically about 55-60 degrees), and have found this quite convenient as I can turn down the heat when I'm not in the shop (to about 40) but still ensure that it will not freeze.o This ceiling mounted heater seems very safe in a dusty environment such as a woodworking shop, because it points down, keeping the red hot rods clean and dust free. In about 5 years of use (with my original Marvin heater) I never had any safety issues, even though I occasionally allow some heavy dust to accumulate on the top of the unit.o Another nice effect of these ceiling heaters is that when I have glue-ups or finishing jobs I can place them on the bench directly under the heater and they will cure faster than if place off in a colder corner.As stated in the title, I use this heater in my woodworking shop, which is actually a converted double garage, about 680 square feet in size, located in the Southern Interior of BC Canada. It is insulated, with a wood floor over the concrete slab. The automatic garage doors, which leaked a lot of air and heat, have been removed and walled in. Before I removed the automatic garage doors and covered the cement floor with wood, I was able to keep things from freezing with just a single 1500 Watt infrared heater - in fact I was usually able to keep the shop at 50 degrees or better if I allowed the heater to run long enough.If a single heater was sufficient for my original cement floored shop, you may be wondering why I need two heaters after I've added a cozy wood floor and improved the insulation. It is so that I can better spread the heat around (by running each on half power - 750 watts), and also because I can run them both full blast for the first half hour or so to bring the shop up to a comfortable temperature faster (about twice as fast, in fact).A quick word about comparing heaters to each other. Virtually all electric heaters produce an identical amount of heat per watt. So, in the long run, any 1500 Watt heater, say a fan based unit, will make a room as warm as any infrared heater that is also 1500 watts. The difference lies in what gets warmed up first. A fan based heater first heats the air, and the air then heats the stuff in your shop, including you. The infrared first heats the stuff it's pointing at, which then eventually heats the air. If it's pointing at you, well you feel warm right away, but if it's not, then you don't feel much warmth until the whole room is warm.If you are comparing this heater to non-electric units, it's best to compare BTUs. This one puts out about 5,000 BTUs.Hope this was useful.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,January 6, 2012,B0041G69CM,Optimus H-9010 Garage/Shop Ceiling or Wall Mount Utility Heater,Home & Kitchen,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041G69CM,Optimus,$44.49
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Tricky wiring job simplified by this Lutron kit,I found the dimmers in this kit to be easy to install. The components are high quality, and well designed which makes them easy and intuitive to use. The kit includes everything you need to control two light circuits in a variety of ways: directly using the dimmer switch; wirelessly using the Pico remotes; with a smart phone or tablet using the free app; with voice commands using Apples Siri (e.g. turn on the kitchen lights); with programmed instructions using the app (e.g. turn porch lights on at sunset, and off at 11:30 pm).If you are upgrading circuits that are controlled by a single switch, installation is simple. Just remove the two wires from your existing switch, connect them to the Lutrons two wires and thats it. You dont even need to worry about the ordering of the two wires - it doesnt matter. Of course, connect the ground wire if you can, but its not essential.Upgrading circuits controlled by two switches (called a 3-way circuit) is a little bit more complicated. In this case youll probably want to install a Pico remote in one switch box, and the dimmer in the other. Youll need to purchase a Pico Wall Plate Bracket, available here on amazon to mount the Pico.Upgrading circuits with three or more switches is the most complex case, but still doable. Lutron has instructions showing how to handle all these cases in its Advanced Installation Guide - a PDF file you can download from their website.Im impressed with the design - there is more depth than you might at first think. For example, the Pico remotes are more than they seem at first. They are exactly the same size as the visible / touchable part of a standard light switch, and they can therefore be installed anywhere a light switch currently exists. Since they dont need to be wired in, they can also be installed in lots of other places: stick a wall plate anywhere, and pop the Pico inside the hole - it will look just like a real wired-in switch; set it on a table, or carry it in your car or pocket. Ill upload a photo showing a Pico mounted in a wall plate so you can see how seamlessly it fits.I solved a tough wiring problem thanks to this kit. My wrap-around porch lights are on two different circuits - one for the side, and one for the front. A walk across the house was needed adjust the lights at the two dimmers. The traditional way to solve this would require wire pulling, cuts into walls and ceilings, drywall repair and repainting - way too much work. With this kit I used the two Caseta dimmers to replace my existing ones. I then paired each Pico remote to control *both* dimmers. I installed a Pico next to each dimmer and job done! Now I use the Pico in either location, and all my porch lights can be adjusted together.I used the Lutron app to turn my porch lights on at sunset, and off at 11:30 pm (set to 15% brightness). It works like a charm, and means no more forgetting to turn off the porch lights. The switches will automatically adjust as the sunset time changes, so there is no need to fiddle with the ON time throughout the year. It all happens automatically.This second generation Smart Bridge brings support for Apples HomeKit, which among other things means you can adjust your lights using Siri voice control. I really like this feature. Its cool, and its fun. I just say turn on the porch lights, and Siri makes it happen. Its too early for me to say this is truly useful - perhaps the novelty will wear off in time. There are other Apple-based possibilities as well, such as having your lights come on when you arrive home (or more precisely, when your iPhone arrives within the geofence). These are early days for HomeKit, and Im sure it will expand in capability, especially if the marketplace signals interest.If you have a first generation Smart Bridge it wont do the Apple stuff, but it will still work fine otherwise.The Pico remotes come with pedestal mounts, basically a sturdy weighted base with a rubber bottom. These are surprisingly good quality. Nice to have if you do not mount the Picos on the wall as I did.Something about Lutron dimmers thats worth mentioning is their ability to dim down very low - till your bulb is giving off the faintest orange glow. And do it in silence, with no noticeable hum. Not all dimmers can do this.You can probably tell I think this is a good product. Of course, nothing is perfect, so here are a few nit-picks describing some things I dont like:1. The included instruction sheet gives enough information for basic, simple setup, but I found I needed to go to the website and root around for the complete instructions.2. The app runs only in portrait mode, which is fine on the iPhone, but a bit of a pain on the iPad.3. Setup was a bit surprising. I disconnect my old bridge, and plugged in the new one, as per written instructions. But then the app had me reconnect the old bridge in order to transfer information. Not a big deal, but the documentation should be updated.I've reviewed Caseta products before, in some detail, and not much has changed other than the Smart Bridge and Apple integration. So if youd like more details please see my other reviews.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 5, 2015,B00XPW6824,Lutron P-BDG-PKG2W Caseta Wireless Smart Lighting In-Wall Dimmer Kit, HomeKit-enabled,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XPW6824,Lutron Electronics Company, Inc.,$189.95
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,If you enjoy fine tools, consider this square,It's been a week since I received this square. It has already become one of my favorite marking and measuring tools (I mostly do woodworking).Pros:- finely machined, high quality square- perfectly matches the accuracy of other non-sliding machinist squares I own (no light visible between top and sides when pressed against another known-true square)- nice weight, lighter than solid squares- blade slides smoothly and locks tightly in place (see note 1)- markings on blade have high definition, are easy to read- the blems (blemishes) are very minor, and strictly cosmetic (see photos)- the seller, Taylor Toolworks, is very responsive. (See note 2).- the square is exactly 1 wide, which makes aligning at any location easier due to having two reference surfaces.Cons:- I'm racking my brain, trying to think of something. Guess what? Nothing comes to mind.- Okay, I did think of something. If you are an absolute perfectionist, the slight cosmetic blems might drive you crazy. If this describes you, simply buy the unblemished version.Note 1: As delivered this square adjusts quite smoothly - much better than your average carpenters square. However, you can improve the action even more by taking it apart and smoothing off the tiny burrs on each side of the lock pin (the ridge near the top of the pin, to be exact). Don't worry, this won't affect accuracy as that comes from registration of the edge of the blade against the square. I also applied a tiny drop of lubricant on the sliding surfaces. These two steps made a significant improvement in the action, which was already very good to begin with. Now it is silky smooth.If you are interested, I used Boeshield T-9 lubricant, which dries to a waxy film that does not attract dust. I smoothed the burrs with a few strokes of a fine file, followed by some gentle rubbing against very fine 1000 grit sandpaper.Note 2: There was one small problem with the square I received. The blade did not lock tightly in place every time - it took a few days before I noticed this. I took it apart and determined the locking screw (1/4-28 thread) was a little too loose, possibly due to damaged threads. I contacted Taylor Toolworks , they promptly sent me a new screw, and it completely fixed the problem. Even though I asked for just the screw, they sent me the entire locking mechanism (screw, nut and spring) which was above and beyond what I was expecting. Very good customer service indeed.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 30, 2015,B00WDCNSA2,Blem Cosmetic Second PEC 6" 4R Double Square with 1/64, 1/32, 1/16 and 1/8 Markings 7105-460SEC-Blk,Industrial & Scientific,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WDCNSA2,PEC Tools Products Engineering Corporation,$22.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Enduring Swimsuit for Endurance Swimmers,Review of Speedo Men's Race Endurance+ Polyester Solid Square Leg SwimsuitI have been an open water distance swimmer for decades, and in that time I've gone through countless swimsuits. During the winter months I swim in chlorinated pools, which cause the most damage to swimsuits. A number of years ago I purchased this swimsuit model and it lasted and lasted, and lasted. I don't have exact numbers for you, but it seems like these suits last at least 3 times longer than anything I have used before (and I mostly always used the Speedo brand, just other models).In addition to being long lasting, it's very comfortable. Doesn't look to bad either, but that is my lowest priority.Definitely worth considering by anyone who does a lot of swimming and is interested in a good quality product.Thanks for reading.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,May 28, 2014,B000YZG4EM,Speedo Men's Endurance+ Polyester Solid Square Leg Swimsuit, Black, 34,Clothing,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YZG4EM,Speedo,$30.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Significantly Improved my Mac mini (Late 2012),Review: Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR3 1600 MHz Laptop MemorySignificantly Improved my Mac mini (Late 2012)I want to thank those reviewers that stated this memory works Late 2012 Mac Minis. On that advice I upgraded my Mini from 4 to 16 GB.I have not done any precise timing measurements, however the system performance seems to have improved considerably. In general apps start up faster, I can have many apps open at the same time, and switching between them is instantaneous. The system also boots up a bit faster as well.Before this upgrade I was also considering adding a solid state hard drive. I am happy to report that I no longer feel a pressing need to do so. Perhaps due to disk caching, the original 5200 RPM hard drive seems to perform quite nicely now.As a final comparison, I was recently in an Apple store, and had the opportunity to play with a current model Mac Book Pro with 8GB RAM, and solid state hard drive. I was surprised to find that it did not feel much faster than my 2 yr old Mini with 16GB does now. While Im sure in dedicated benchmark tests it would be far superior to my Mini, for the things I do it just wasnt noticeable. Of course this is entirely subjective, and I am certainly biased (I love my Mini), so take this comparison with a grain of salt.I hope this helps other Mini owners with their memory upgrade decisions.Details of my mini, from system report - About This Mac:Mac Mini (Late 2012)Processor 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5Memory Installed: Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10),http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,March 24, 2015,B0076W9Q5A,Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop  Memory (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10),Computers & Accessories,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076W9Q5A,Corsair,$83.99
Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Better than the Maestro in most, but not all ways (needs preset),The Caseta Dimmer & Pico Remote Controller:Caseta dimmers are a stand-alone product that may be purchased and used without the smart bridge and its associated app. They work with pretty much everything you would reasonably expect including LEDs, CFLs, Halogens and other incandescents. Note that LEDs and CFLs must be dimmer capable in order to work.Casetas have abandoned the elegant interface of the Maestro dimmers. The large single button has morphed into 4 smaller buttons - On, Off, Dim Up and Dim Down. I like the original design better. However human-machine interfaces are highly subjective, and perhaps I am in the minority.The remote has shrunk losing considerable bulk and weight, but still has the same number of switches as the previous model (5). The buttons are the same as found on the Caseta dimmer, with the addition of a round favorite button. It has been upgraded to a wireless signal, rather than the originals IR (infrared) beam. That means you can operate the dimmer even from another room, or outside your house. I think the remote is an improvement over the original design .Lutron claims the Pico remote will operate for 10 years before needing a fresh battery. Ill take their word on that since even my old remote has never needed a new battery during all its years of service (about 6 years and counting).The Pico remote has an impressive operating 350 foot range based on a simple test I performed.If you are interested in the details of my test, read on: I installed the dimmer into a plastic electrical box with a light bulb socket and extension cord. I plugged it into an exterior socket on my porch, hung it from a rafter so I could see the bulb light up, and proceeded down the street counting paces as I went. I found I was able to operate the switch reliably for up to 140 paces (which works out to 350 feet).The Pico remote is very small, but not too small. Its 2-5/8 high, 1-1/4 wide, and 3/8 thick. It will fit perfectly in any standard Decora wall plate (which is very convenient if you want to stick it on your wall and have it appear to be a regular switch). If you are a stickler for accuracy, I hereby confess that it is actually a tiny bit wider and a tiny bit thinner than stated, by about 1/16.If you have ever wired two switches to control the same light, you will greatly appreciate the simplicity of using the Caseta and its Pico remote to do the same job - especially as it allows one to avoid renovating existing house wiring. The savings in wiring and time can easily justify the cost of the Caseta / Pico combination (you can mount the Pico in numerous ways, including in the wall like a standard switch, using an optional bracket).The remote can be paired with more than one dimmer switch. Thats a very powerful feature which could also be highly cost effective in certain scenarios. For example, my outdoor lights are controlled by three separate switches, located in different locations. I would prefer to have all lights controlled by a single switch, dimmable, and turn on and off automatically (on at sunset, off at 11:00 pm). To do this with traditional switches would require pulling a lot of wire, and wiring in photocells and timers to do the job. It could also be done using three Caseta dimmers, a single Pico remote (to control all three manually), and the smart bridge to do the sunrise automatic timer function. It would cost a homeowner about three hundred dollars to buy the necessary Lutron switches and smart bridge (at this time). Now consider how much you would pay to buy the wire and fittings to do it the traditional way. Even assuming you can do all this yourself you might not save much using traditional wiring. If you needed to hire an electrician I bet youd be many hundreds of dollars ahead using the Lutron gear.For more comprehensive information about these gadgets one can go to the Lutron website named casetawireless. Since Amazon strips out url links, I am unable to provide the exact web address.

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,4,Very nice product with a few flaws.,Review of Bosch DLR130K Laser Distance MeasurerThis handy little device is slightly smaller, and lighter than my trusty 25 foot tape measure. It won't replace your tape (for example there is no quick, convenient way to hook the edge of a board to measure off a cut), but it will do many of the same measurements, often better and quicker (for example finding "inside" distances such a a window interior or from one wall to another). It will also take measurements that a tape simply cannot (assuming just 1 person doing the measuring), for example picture yourself on a ladder, trying to find the distance from a window frame to the wall when your tape cannot reach it without collapsing, or checking the height of a soffit that's more than 15 feet above you, ....Do you need a laser distance measurer? I can't answer that, however I can tell you that it saves me a significant amount of time because I do a lot of carpentry / renovation work which involves many, many measurements.Here's what I like about this new DLR130 from Bosch:o It does fractional measurements in inches to an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. For example 98 - 3/16 inches. The previous laser from Bosch would only do feet & inches combined (e.g. 8' 2-1/16"). This is a really important new feature for me because my feeble mind doesn't deal well with the feet-and-inches style output - it causes me to make all kinds of stupid cutting errors. Thank you Bosch for adding this pure fractional inches only mode.o It is small and light (smaller than me 25 foot tape measure) weighing just over 6 ounces with all four AAA batteries installed. It is 4 inches long, 2-1/4 inches wide and 1-1/4 inches thick.o Measures things really close to the unit starting at 2 inches. Older lasers (such as my TLM100) do not work at less than 24 inches. Although it may not seem like a big deal it makes the measurer much more usable in practice.o Good feedback - when the laser completes a measurement it provides both audible and tactile feedback in the form of a "clunk". At first I though this was kind of weird - why not just a beep? - but then I realized the subtle beauty of the design. If you are wearing hearing protection or are in a noisy environment you can "feel" when the measurement is complete. The clunk sound is generated at such a low volume that it is unlikely to disturb anyone more than a few feet away.o Has a ¼ inch threaded hole for tripod mounting (of course an inventive person could use this for other attachments as well....).o Comes complete with four AAA batteries, and they last a long, long time (30,000 individual measurements or 5 hours of operation in continuous measurement mode with 1.5v alkaline). You can also use rechargeable batteries such as 1.2V NiMh, although they won't last as long, due to their reduced voltage. This is another technical improvement over the older lasers which required a 9v battery.o Comes with a nice pouch (apparently) made of ballistic nylon with a Velcro strap to hook over your belt. One minor problem here is that the strap is a little bit too small to fit securely over a wide 2 inch work belt. It does it, but there isn't much Velcro left holding it in place.o Continuous measurement mode is a nice touch. Allows you to use the laser more like a tape measure in certain applications (for example, when you want to mark off every 16 inches along a wall to show where studs should be). Most of the time it updates the display very quickly - about 2 times per second. The manual states that in certain unfavorable circumstances this could be reduced to as little as 1 update every 4 seconds but I have not experienced this slowdown in my applications.o Sighting pins help one to see where the laser is over long distances or in bright light conditions. These are nothing more than slight notches on the right side of the case. Not a hugely important feature for my work, but I suspect those who take really long distance measurements might find it useful.Here is what I do not like:o Reference point (measure from the back or front) is not saved when the unit is turned off. It always restarts with the back of the unit as the reference point. In practice this does not bother me, but other people may feel differently.o Memory display is only in decimal feet or decimal meters. This can be a little bit irritating for people who like to operate in pure inches mode. It's more than a little inconvenient to take a measurement like 95 - 5/16 inches, save it to memory, recall it and see it displayed as 7.942 feet.o Display is not back lit. This would be a nice feature to have, especially for those of us with tired old eyes.o Laser beam is not parallel to the unit. If you press the unit flat against a wall, or floor or any plane surface, the beam rises off the surface at an angle of about 1 inch every 8 feet. To overcome this one has to lift the back of the laser just slightly off the surface to keep the beam parallel. This wouldn't be a very big deal, except that pressing down on the measure button with holding the unit off the surface make for a wobbly, inaccurate situation. I would say this is the biggest problem with this device, and the only one that gives me pause in recommending it highly.I talked to Tanya at Bosch customer service, who promised to look into it and get back to me. At first I was impressed with the service, but a week passed with no call back. I finally called Tanya again, and she not only did not apologize for failing to call back, she indicated that she thought this was a problem and that more recent versions do not have this defect. She promised to call me back when she knew more (heard from engineering) but it has now been another week and I've heard nothing. I was invited to send my unit to the repair center at my expense, and ask for a "recalibration" but I'm not sure it is worth the trouble or expense (and it's not certain that they will indeed correct this problem).I would have given this product five stars except for the poor customer service and the non-parallel laser beam. I do have an early version of this product (March 2009), so perhaps other purchasers will have better luck.Also note that you can peruse the manual for this product online at[...] if you want more specific details about it.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,August 12, 2009,B001U89QBU,Bosch DLR130K Laser Measure,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U89QBU,Bosch,$79.75

Joe Mooney,A2CACLOQB5F7YU,5,Why I Bought Fein instead of Bosch, or others,I really like this specialized tool. It allows me to do things that would otherwise be impossible. It allows me to do many tasks more quickly, and (often) more accurately than any other method. The build quality is outstanding - noticeably better than most of my pro-quality tools. It starts softly, runs with near zero vibration and very low noise. The tool is such a pleasure to use that I find myself looking for excuses to use it. If youve ever owned a tool this graceful this you probably know what I mean.I still recall my amazement, years ago as I watched my Orthopedic surgeon remove a fiberglass cast from my leg using a saw with a round thin blade. She explained that because it vibrated it would cut only hard stuff, and would not puncture the skin. It worked like magic, and I have been fascinated with Oscillating Multi-Tools (OMTs) ever since.However, I could never quite convince myself I really *needed* such a tool - mostly because I am not a professional. Boy, was I wrong.A few months ago I decided to take the plunge and by an OMT. I spent many hours researching, reading reviews on amazon, in trade magazines, and of course watching videos on youtube. I soon narrowed down my list of contenders to the brands of pro-quality tools that I already have good experiences with: Bosch, Dewalt, Makita, Milwaukee, Fein. As another reviewer explained in Tools of The Trade magazine, these brands are all capable tools - but there are differences that, depending on ones needs, make some more suitable than others.In my tools I tend to favor ergonomics, low-noise, low-vibration and accuracy. This reduced my list of candidates to just Bosch and Fein. At this point I made up a checklist comparing the two (below). Its very difficult to say which is the better tool. Each has its strengths. If you are on the fence, hopefully the information below will help you decide which of these tools will suit you best.Bosch MX30 versus Fein MM 350Q:Weight: Fein 3.1 pounds, Bosch at 3.7 pounds.Warranty: Fein 3 year, Bosch 1 year.Cord Length: Fein 16 feet, Bosch 13 feet.Oscillating Angle Degrees (single/total): Fein (1.7 / 3.2), Bosch (1.4 / 2.8)Tool-less blade change: Fein (yes), Bosch (Yes!) Bosch is better - no bolt required.Noise Level dB at 2[1]: Fein (72-80), Bosch (68-84)Tool Positions[2]: Fein (8, 45 degree increments), Bosch (12, 30 degree increments)Tool Compatibility[3]: Fein (Fein & All Bosch Blades), Bosch (Bosch, a few Fein blades)Vibration[4]: Fein has less vibration than BoschPower[5]: Fein (3.6 amps), Bosch (3.0 amps)Oscillations Per Minute[6]: Fein (10,000-19,500), Bosch (8,000-20,000)Variety of attachments: Fein wins with many cool attachments that do not fit the Bosch.Constant Speed Circuitry: Fein (yes), Bosch (yes)Change pad without removing sandpaper: Fein (no), Bosch (yes) Bosch wins this one.Bench Mounting[7]: Fein (yes), Bosch (maybe?)I was initially drawn to the Bosch due to its apparently superior blade change mechanism. I was concerned that the Fein mechanism, with its removable bolt, would be cumbersome and irritating to use. However, I came across an excellent series of videos by Jon Eakes, sponsored by FeinCanada which changed my thinking. I watched experienced Fein users swap blades quickly, and rotate them with little effort. Also, the bolt has the potential to exert a stronger grip on the tool, although I have not heard of any complaints with the Bosch. I highly recommend you take a look at Jon Eakes series of videos no matter what OMT you decide to purchase - it shows the proper techniques for avoiding many common problems. It also will open your eyes to the unique jobs that only an OMT can do. (Not all of his videos are on youtube, do a google search and go to his own website for the full set.)Footnotes:[1] Noise level - most folks run the tool at top speed much of the time, so its the highest noise level that matters most, making Fein the winner of this category. Fein publishes their noise level data, but Bosch does not, so I used a test performed by a youtube video review using the same meter at the same distance (thanks to Tool Craze for this). Note that every dB matters.[2] Tool Positions. If quantity is important, then Bosch wins with 12 positions, spaced every 30 degrees (0, 30, 60, 90, ). Fein has 8 positions, spaced every 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, ).[3] The Fein blades attach to a 4 position cross on the tool, the Fein blades have 8 slots with the net effect Fein blades can be mounted in 45 degree increments. Most Bosch blades have a cross that allows mounting directly to the Fein, but it only allows rotation in 90 degree increments. Using the OIS001 adapter any Bosch blade can be mounted on the Fein, in 30 degree increments. Many of the most unique and interesting Fein blades will not mount on the Bosch. Fein wins this category with the ability to mount the widest variety of blades.You can purchase the Bosch OIS001 adapter here on amazon for a few dollars.[4] Vibration. Fein publishes its vibration data but as usual, Bosch does not. Numerous reviews Ive read indicate the Fein has significantly less vibration than Bosch. I havent used the Bosch, but I can tell you the Fein so smooth it still makes me smile inside every time I turn it on.[5] Power. Assuming motors and drive systems are equally efficient, the one that consumes the most amps will provide the most power. This implies the Fein is about 20% more powerful than the Bosch, all other things being equal.[6] Oscillations per Minute. Even though the Fein is a tiny bit slower than the Bosch (2.5%), it swings though a greater angle (21%), which more than compensates.[7] Bench Mounting. Fein sells a Table and Drill Stand Support (part# 9-26-02-083-01-0 available on amazon). I have found nothing comparable for the Bosch. Even better, the Fein has two bolt holes built into the MM 350Q which makes it easy to make your own mounting stand. I made a quick prototype from a 1/2 x 1/2 x 4 piece of wood that fastens to the 350Q using (2) M6 screws, spaced 7/8 apart. It took but a few minutes, and allows me to mount the Fein in my bench vise. Ill post a photo with the measurements.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CACLOQB5F7YU,July 6, 2015,B00L3US71U,Fein FMM 350Q TOP 2014 Multimaster Top,Home Improvement,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3US71U,Fein,$349.00

PoochMania,A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,4,White teeth 2-3 levels up in 1 week.,I received a coupon to purchase this item in exchange for unbiased review.This teeth whiting kit does work. However, I use it with some modification and not following the instruction. The reason is, using tray to apply gel, it burns gum and make teeth too sensitive.My modification to using this product: Squeeze small amount of gel on paper dish and using small eye makeup brush (I had couple of new brushes that I saved, but I washed with soap and sanitize with alcohol before using the brush) to apply the gel to the teeth. ** Need to clean brush well after each use. I carefully apply gel to the teeth (not touching the gum) and cover the teeth with food wrap, so that gel would do its job. I used plastic food wrap because I dont want inside of lips to touch the gel. Apply UV light over the wrap. I left it for about 2 mins and do the treatment, 2x day After 1 week, shade level up at least 2-3 levels whiter.The way I am using, 1 week application mentioned above method, I only used 1/2 syringe  treatment on front 8 teeth, top and bottom.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,October 4, 2015,B014615Z44,Home Professional Teeth Whitening Kit Packed with 9 Pieces Whitening Gel 6 Pieces Mouth Trays and 1pc Whitening Light Bonus Shade Guide and Using Manual,Health & Personal Care,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014615Z44,Ever Youth,$18.99
PoochMania,A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,5,Great item and it can be used in other application, not just Stroller.,When I was asked to review this stroller hook in exchange for unbiased review, first I thought I have no way to review this since I dont have kids in stroller or knew anyone who can review this item. But, after though about it for a while, I thought I can use this to help drying flowers.I dry flower (Japanese lantern, espcially this time of the year while flower is red). But, I have to cut it at the near the roots and have to hang dry upside down in the shade area. But, this flower is delicate and should keep it all in same position until it is all dry. During drying process, it cant get wet either, so I have to move the bundle of this flowers here and there, in/out of the house often. This drying process takes about 2 months. (Labor of love...)So, this hook comes really handy. Now, moving the bundled flower here and there is very easy. All I have to do is, to put bundled cut stems with rope and hang upside down on the hook. Then, find the place to dry. The other end hook is Velcro, so I can wrap it over trellis during the day and bring it inside to hang.) It is working perfectly for me.This hook is very strong, Its made with plastic, but its well made and good quality. I like Velcro application. Its quick and easy to on/off and also strong enough to hold whatever you are using the hook for. The Velcro on this hook is long enough, it is easily wrap around over even very thick handles.,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,September 17, 2015,B00V62U5GK,Attmu Stroller Hook, Hanger for Baby Diaper Bags, Nursing Bottle, Groceries, Black, Set of 2,Baby,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V62U5GK,Attmu,$8.99
PoochMania,A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,5,Handy tool everyone should have one. Easy to use, save time and money.,I already used this device in 2 application and save lots of time and money. I wouldnt go over how to use it since manual explains well. Rather, I will write how I used this item.1st time I used for this item:We are planning to build vacation home and the area we are building home, they will not grant permit unless new building is certain distance from the neighbors property. Thus, home has to be certain distance from neighbors houses in all sides where we are building ours. Our lot is on the hill and most houses in this area are pretty tight, so we have to considered everything; distance from my house to neighbors to how to situate the house (I want my living space to face south or south-east), etc. So many things to consider before submit the plan to for permit. All these can be done by my Architect, but each time we made changes or sit with him for consultation, it cost money. So, this meter came really handy and saved a lots of time and money in our situation, especially, now home we are building is out of state and it takes lots of planning to meet with everyone involved in building the house.The device I have measure up to 196 feet, which is more than enough distance to measure my property to neighbors houses. Just standing and point the laser to the neighbors property and it gives accurate distance. I got all sorts of information measured by this handy handheld Measure finder and submitted to Architect. Of course, he has to double check the information that I gave him, but since he knows exactly how I want my house to be face, it made his job easier and we save time and money. Its amazing how little portable Measure Finder provide information that I needed so fast. In my situation, I dont need to have precise measurement, but measuring the distance on the hill, its pretty much impossible to use the tape measure for reading. This device, you can point to anywhere and get the measurement.2nd time I used for this item:We need to install antenna and we decide to put it in the attic. But we didnt know the distance. With this device, just set the Measure Finder and point to the attics ceiling and it gives distance instantly. We are buying the supplies like cables cut for this job (not pre-cut package) and I want to make sure we buy enough, so the cable is in one long piece, not couple of cables put together.Just short time I had this UNI-T 60Meter Measure Finder, I put it to good use already. I think this should be one of tool that everyone should keep in their tool box. I can think of many occasion where I could have use this Measure Finder.Example; if I want to measure the size of the room, but there are furniture (or whatever items in the way) and in order to get the measure of the room, whatever items in the way has to be removed before I can measure the distance. However, this device, I dont need to. Just put the device on the wall and point the laser to the end of the wall, it gives the number instantly.Disclaimer: I received 60M/196feet handheld Mini Measure Finder to test, in exchange I write my opinion about the item. The Company/Seller did not influence in anyway how I rate this product.

PoochMania,A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85,5,Must have Item especially for DIYers. A little over $20.00, it's bargain. I would recommend this item without any hesitation!,Disclaimer: I received coupon to cover the cost the USB Waterproof Endoscope Inspection Tube Visual Camera in exchange for my unbiased review on this item. Quality: Its very well made, useful, functioning Endoscope Inspection Tube. Long length cable (cord)  16.5 feet: It is convenient to connect from PC to area where you want to inspect. Built-in LED Bright light  easy to see To control how bright you want inspection area to lit, you can adjust dial right at the USB connector. Waterproof  good to inspect wet areas. Comes with hooks, mirror and magnets  scope head can be attached by hooks or magnets depend on the working area which parts can be used. If it can be hooked or attached by magnet. If not, just regular masking tape can be used to hold the scope. The mirror can be also attach to the scope head for difficult viewing area. But scope's head is small enough, I think mirror may not needed for most application. The viewing application (provided-CD included in the package) has multiple settings to control pictures/cam. Installation is very easy. When you open CD, Youll see manual document file. You can read it first and see how to install.**** Here is short version of installation guide: Click on &#34;ViewPlayCap&#34; and select &#34;Accept&#34;. Then, it will automatically extract all files and installed under c:\\program files (x86). After this, navigate to c:\\program files (x86) and click on ViewPlayCap.exe The rest of the settings (i.e. resolution of the pictures, types of output files, etc) can be done through browsing ViewPlayCap application's menu tabs *****This is very useful tool, must have, handy item everyone should own one. A little over $20.00, it is bargain and make DIY task easier. The ViewPlayCap application has a lots of settings to control quality of pictures for clear view. Its very powerful application.
