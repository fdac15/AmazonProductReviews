The set up was incredibly smooth. All I had to do was install the the EyeFi app, it came up and told me &quot;insert the SD card and take a picture&quot;. That's it! No hotspot to connect to, no need configuration of any kind. I took a picture a 1 minute and 5 seconds later it appeared on my phone. After the initial upload the images were uploaded a little fast, videos took a little longer.EyeFi app also allows some basic operations such as deleting files, sharing, and a few other basic operations. It is easy to use.Is it perfect? No. After using the card for a couple of weeks I ran into several practical issues. They are not deal breakers for me but prevent it from being a perfect experience:1) It uploads ALL photos, so if you shoot a lot of photos in raw format this can fill up the phone memory.2) It would be nice if there was an option to delete images from SD after a successful transfer. Such options does not exist and SD card needs to manually cleaned up - either periodically or when one runs out of space.3) I wish it had is a switch that allows me to turn off WIFI on the card (at a hardware level). I have this feature on my old WIFI SD card and do use it when I do not want uploads to occur.I received Eyefi sdcard for testing and review. It exceed my expectations for ease of use and set up. I have no problem using, although after several weeks of use some functionality that I would have found useful is not available.Ali Julia review"

What I did not realize from a stock photo is that it has a double zipper. I can unzip the bottom for a more comfortable fit when I sit down so it does not have stretch. The cuffs are double knit. This makes them fit really well and keeps my wrists very warm. My hands tend to get cold and turns out keeping my wrists warm keeps my hands warm! The hoodie's top is not overized, it fits my head without too much draping. I like that the fit is not too loose and not bulky. There are two shallow pockets on the front ( I can fit my hand up to my thumb) so they are almost decorative. It has a beautiful deep plum color.As far as the fit goes, it is true to size but on the smaller size of the range. Because the hoodie has a double zipper the slight tightness around the hips when I sit down is not a problem because I can unzip the bottom while keeping the top zipped up.This hoodie was provided for me for evaluating the fit and sharing my experience with other potential buyers. I am very pleased with it. Great looking, nice color, very warm, love the double zipper.Ali Julia review"

Qi Charger charges a little slower that AC but it does not put any stress on the USB connector since it just lays on top of it. Its size is a good match for Nexus 5 phone. Its size is 5 3/4&#34; x 2 7/8&#34; and 3/4&#34;. Its weight is 9.7 oz. I like its digital charge level indicator.On the negative side, this charger does not support charge through charging, meaning that it cannot charge while being charged. I have a strong preference for power banks which can be charged and charge at the same time.This power bank's QI sweet spot is fairly small. My trick for using Qi on the go (or where it can bumped by kids or pets) is to put a rubber band around the phone and the battery and this keeps the phone on the sweet spot of the charger.This external battery is aimed at Android phones and perform best with Android as both ports on this battery provide 1A. The package includes two charging cables. One a regular micro USB cable, another a double headed which also has a lightening connector. I tested my iPad Mini with this cable and battery and it got charged at 1A, which is below optimal for Apple devices but normal for 1A ports. The Android phone performed was charged at optimal rate on both ports using both cables. In attached photos you can see the readings of the current monitor I used to test the charging performance.I was provided a sample of this battery by Applepie for testing and review as part of new product introduction.Ali Julia review"

Its video is pretty good, it has a simple menu driven interface, and it has WI FI that allows me to see what the camera sees on my smart phone. The video is somewhat overexposed in very bright sun. It is reasonable in when it is totally dark (for example used a night time dash cam) although not as good as my full size cameras. The camera is exactly the same size as GoPro camera. It fits all accessories built for GoPro. I have a drone which has a gimbal designed to work with GoPro and this camera fits into this gimbal as if it was built for it!Set up was easy with a couple points worth noting:1. Documentation says that the name of the camera hot spot is &#34;Sport Cam w9&#34;. This was not what my phone showed, I saw ICAM-N9_00NNNN with a strong signal and when I tried the password included in the documentation it connected.2. To put the camera into WIFI mode you need to select to hit &#34;down button&#34; on the side. The display will reflect that camera is waiting for WI FI connection. Once the phone connects the status changes to &#34;WiFi Connection Ready!&#34;In my video I show live video. It looks good! The delay between the action and display is minimal, it is better than another small camera I have with live video capability. When WIFI Live mode is used, the camera does not record video to micro SD. I wish it could do both at the same time.The package includes a large number of clamps and holders as well as a waterproof case. The manual is pretty reasonable other than the two details I mention above are missing/incorrect.In attached video you can see video of the camera and video taken by the camera. Note that Amazon compresses video so this degrade the video quality in the clip. It produces video in the following resolutions (records in .mov format) using degree HD wide angle lens.SportsShot supports micro SD cards up to 32GB (the micro SD card is not included). It runs on 900mAH and I get slightly over an hour on one charge. To recharge the camera takes about 3 hours from empty.I received this camera for evaluation and review as part of a new product introduction. Getting a free product does not effect what I say. My reviews reflect only my experience with the product and reviews are good or bad only based on how well the product works. If you have questions on something I did not cover post a comment and I'll do my best to answer it.Ali Julia review"

This is an excellent power supply with enough power for any personal computer. Its capacity of 1000w and it has a large number of connectors (total of 10) that gives lots of room for growth. Its size is 7.25&#34; x 3.5&#34; x 6&#34;. Quark 1000 uses heavy duty round cables (i.e. not ribbon cables). All connectors are modular rather than hard-wired. I prefer modular power supplies so the case has only what it needs and thus is less crowded, so this is a big plus.The power supply can handle motherboards with both 20 pin or 24 pin connectors. It supports two SLI graphics cards. It is very quiet.Connectors:(1) One 20 +4 Main plug (modular)(2) Two EPS12V CPU plugs (modular)It supports two CPUs. This is useful for server systems, desktops have 1 CPU.(3) Four PCIe plugs (modular)It supports four high power PCIe cards, typically SLI graphics cards but there are other cards requirind extra power.Most PCIe cards use only the power from the PCIe plug, but high performance high performance graphics cards use this plug (e.g. gaming graphics cards).(4) Five SATA or Molex cable plugs (modular)They use the same plugs and package comes with different cables that can be used as needed.4 SATA cables, each with 4 SATA plugs for a total of 16 SATA devices supported2 Molex cables, each supports 4 IDE drives or FANsI measured the power supply with a power supply tester and all voltages are within tolerance. The attached video includes screen shots that show the power supply tester output.

This pillow is a bit different. It has a spongy center that I can feel. It has a core that feels like foam and goose/down envelope on the outside of the core. What I like about down pillows is that they are not spongy, this pillow has a lot of resilience while a 100% goose/down pillows do not. This is a high loft pillow.This is not a bad pillow, I like it more than a pure polyester foam pillow, but if are looking for a down pillow that is made totally of goose feathers and down (like The Company Store pillows, for example) this is not it.I ordered a standard size and the size was spot on - all my standard pillow cases fit perfectly.Cleaning instructions from the label: do not wash in water, do not dry clean, tumble dryI received this pillow for testing and review, as part of a new product introduction.Ali Julia review"

We see a lot of wild life in our area and we have many bird feeders that are fun to watch. The camera is activated only when something interesting is happening, so every video it captures has something good on it. The battery use is quite good it runs several weeks on one set of batteries while capturing dozens of short videos every day. I checked that after 1 week the battery level indicator showed remaining battery capacity of 2/3. In attached video you have a sampling of videos with the camera mounted in four different locations. The large birds you see in the first segments are the wild turkeys which come to visit us almost every day.The camera runs on eight AA batteries (not included) and you need to provide your own SD card (up to 32G in size).The video quality is highly dependent on lighting. In the day light it is very good, however at dusk or right into the sun the video is okay but not as good as say my SONY NEX5 camera. The wild life camera also takes infrared pictures in total darkness (black and white). I have included a couple of video clips taken at dusk when the camera switched to infrared.This camera is large, robust, has a great camouflaged case. It is waterproof and has been out in several rain storms without any problems. The camouflaged case is 5.5&#34; tall x 4&#34; wide x 2.5&#34; thick.The camera can run in &#34;test&#34; mode or real mode. Test mode allows you to see what the camera is recording using the LCD screen. In the test mode you can also change settings via menus displayed on the LCD screen. The interface is intuitive and controls are easy to use.The camera produces AVI and JPG output. The files appear under the standard DCIM directory on the memory card.The camera records 1080P video and images up to 12MP.* Image Sensor: 12.0 Mega Pixels* Picture Size: 12MP=4000x3000 / 8MP=3840x2160 / 5MP = 2944x1656 ,2MP=1920x1080 (JPEG)* Video Size: 1920x1080 (15fps), 1280 x 720 (30fps), 848x480 (30fps), 640 x 480 (30fps)* Memory: SD-card up to 32GB* IR flash effective to 20 meters (65 feet)* Motion detection: center 30-40°, side 30°, all three sensors 120°* Lens: F=7.45; FOV=55°* Trigger distance: up to 20 meters (65 feet)In addition to the camera in the case, the package include USB cable for TV hookup, a mounting bracket, and a user manual.

The refers to it as &quot;hat hair&quot;. Argan oil hair masque is similar to argan oil but it is a cream and does not feel oily. It is massaged into the scalp and hair after the hair is washed and still damp, left for treatment for up to 5 minutes, and then rinsed off. The manufacturer recommends that the masque be used once a week.Argan mask comes in a 8.5 oz tub (3.25&quot; wide and 2 3/8&quot; tall).I like how it feels on my hands, and how my hair looks after treatment. The only thing that I would have changed is the scent.

I am attaching several photos to help folks plan how to use this power strip. USB outlets are well spaced out.All outlets on the strip work well. I tested each USB port with a current monitor and several of my mobile devices. All 6 USB ports worked well with both Apple and Android devices. Android devices all drew around 1A on all 6 ports. This an optimal rate for my phone. My iPadMini drew above 1A on ports rated 2A (there are two of them), and 0.93A on the ports rated 1A (there are four of them). This is in line with other AC chargers.I would have liked the AC outlets to be spaced out a little wider but other than that it is a nice power strip.

I prefer short beeps to long voice phrases as they interrupt the music for a long time and when I hear it over and over it gets repetitive and annoying. I wish there was an option for beeps or voice.Its speaker is fairly weak. The sound cannot be made very loud. It sounds best when I stream music from SD card and bluetooth.

The main issues with those cameras is aim. You don't know what the camera is aimed at exactly and if you are trying to take video in covert manner you can't be constantly checking it and aiming it. Putting the camera in the frame of the eyeglasses totally solves the problem! All you have to do is look in the right direction. The biggest problem is solved.Now, how is the video quality? The clarify and color is excellent in good light, the sound is captured well, however the video is not smooth, it is rather jerky. Seems like it falls behind and then skips a few frames to catch up. It is fine for a convert video to document something but not something that would look good in an artistic documentary project. The camera did rather poorly in the dim light and the dark. I am including several video clips (good and bad) to give you a better idea of what this camera is capable of.The glasses are designed well, it is impossible to tell they have a camera - there are no give away lights, noises, the frame does not get warm. The interface is pretty easy and the feedback via blinks is simple enough that you don't need to carry a manual with you to know what is happening. One long hold puts the glasses into stand-by mode, a second long hold starts the video. The confirmation that video has began is three blinks with a red LED after which the LED is turned off so there are no give away lights. To stop the video you need to press the button again, the confirmation is the blue light blink.As the camera records the video is saved every 10 minutes. After I fully charged the camera, I was able to record four 10 minute segments (each one was 1.5G). The camera still had a little more power left and I was able to record another shorter segment, about 4-5 minutes.The camera has no controls. The only thing you can control is setting the date to the current date, and this is done by creating a text file which contains the current date. A sample copy of this text file is present on the micro SD card. Just edit it with any text editor and modify sample time to current time. Save the file. The name of the file us Time.txt.To charge the glasses from empty to full takes about 2 hours. The charging cable is unique - I don't have anything like it in vast collection of cords. It is smaller than mini USB, I believe it is USB-MINI4P. Bottom line - DO NOT LOSE THIS CABLE!!!!Micro SD is slot is revealed when you bend the arm of the glasses, it took me a few minutes to find it (I show where it is in my video). When I plug in the USB cord into my computer the 8G drive is mounted and I can copy all files from it to my computer. 8G SD card is included in the package. The glasses can take a card up to 32G. The camera produces either jpg photos (1280x1024) or AVI videos (1280x720).Finally, if something goes wrong it is nice to have an escape hatch. There is a reset to manufacturer's setting pin hole on the camera.Overall, a very good combination of stealth and video.This camera is provided by Prime Pro.Ali Julia review"

It would not be warm enough to wear in New England during the winter, but for late fall and early spring it will work nicely. It is extremely light in weight (8.9 oz), very thin (not one of those bulky parkas) and made with real goose down (90%) and feathers (10%). For its lightness and thinnest it is very warm. The jacket has two side pockets and two inside pockets.Finding the right size is tricky. What you need to know is that the drop down list shows Asian/European sizes and not the American sizes. When I ordered the park the product description portion contained measurements which allowed one to map the size from the drop down list (Aisan sizes) to the garment size in inches. However when I got the Parka the actual measurements did not match the table in the description. I provided the feedback about this mismatch to the seller and I see he removed the table. Hopefully he is working on posting an updated table.Here are the measurements for the one I got. Typically Asian sizes are two sizes smaller than American. My husband normally wears Large, so I ordered XXL. According to the chart to the description the chest should have been 46.5&#34;, however the parker I got is 44&#34; (outside measurements, inside somewhat smaller).This jacket is provided by Skywards for review to test out size and fit.Ali Julia review"

This is not surprised because it works by measuring the surface temperature of different areas. Wet areas are cooler than other areas, heat leaks also show up as a different surface area from areas that are well insulated.One key thing to know about this thermal camera is that it works by measuring the SURFACE temperatures. It cannot penetrate walls. Its imagery shows the differences between temperatures on the surface - the cooler areas are shown in blue. In addition to the over the air measurements, the meter includes an external pin probe. The pin probe can measure moisture to the depth of 0.75&#34;.The package include a thick manual, however the reason it is so thick that it covers a very large number of languages. Only three pages for each language. A more detailed manual is included in the internal memory of the camera itself under &#34;DOCS&#34; directory and &#34;User Guide&#34; subdirectory.The camera comes with built-in memory card. The memory card is not removable. To get images from the camera you need to connect the camera to the PC using a USB cable (included). The camera does not support wireless operations.The camera runs on 3.7 V Rechargeable Li-ion polymer battery. Note that to replace it the camera needs to be mailed backed to manufacturer. Seems like a bad idea, but maybe it is because the camera is waterproofed.The camera takes still photos and produces small files in BMP format. The photos appear under DCIM subdirectory with names that look like this: &#34;FLIR0001.BMP&#34; The photos are pretty low res as you see in my video, but enough to see what is going on. The camera does not take video, there is no timer for lapse photos, each photo requires a button push.The camera operates at pretty good distance I was able to get reading from 30 feet away.The camera comes without a case. It has an odd shape and I have not found a good case for it yet and storing it in a nylon bag. It size is 5.75&#34; tall x 2.75 wide x 1,5&#34; thick. It weighs 11.1 oz.The camera has no screw for a tripod, you have to hold in your hand when taking measurements.So what is the bottom line? About 10 years ago we had done a professional thermal analysis of our house which helped us add extra insulation in the right areas. When I pulled out the old report I noticed that photos were taken by FLIR system, although a different model. This camera worked almost as well (the other model provided the actual surface temperatures as it was designed to be a heat leak detector rather than moisture detector and had more colors). I looked at the area which we did not fix because it was hard to get to, and this camera showed the same leaks as the professional report. The professional report cost us several hundred dollars, so even though this camera is not cheap using it a couple of time would put us ahead of hiring someone to do the reading for us.This camera is provided by FLIR.Ali Julia review"

The only issue I have with the timer is that the battery door does not close tightly. A fall from about 3 feet heigh makes the cover and the batteries fly off. For that reason I no longer use the timer mounted with a magnet as a slight brush against it makes it fall off the fridge.I received this timer from MeasuPro for testing and review.Ali Julia review"

This shampoo generates a medium amount of suds, which is quite sudsy for a non-sulfate shampoo. My hair feels clean and briefly has the scent of coconut.This shampoo has no sulfates. Sulfates attract water and oil which allows shampoo to separate dirt and oil. It's been used as an ingredient in shampoos for its foaming properties. It's cheap and effective in removing impurities from your hair. My hairdresser recommended to me to avoid sulfate in shampoos as they may strip essential oils in my hair, resulting in hair feeling and looking dried out. If you look at the ingredients and see sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLEF) or ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) the that shampoo contains sulfates.

In my original review I pointed out a flaw that the belt is missing a loop to hold the long end of the belt for those who fit at the low end of the range. Turns out the buckle can be removed in order to trim the belt to my size and then secure it back neatly, therefore the is no long piece hanging out that would need an additional loop to hold it in place.Original review (with the comments about the missing loop removed).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is a unique belt, it does not have your typical buckle and holes. It is held together by a ratcheting system. It holds very well but it is less forgiving about the fit because it only holds in a 9&#34; area where the ratcheting system is attached on the reverse side. If someone's size is on a border line of how the belt fits it is something to keep in mind.I really like the ratchet mechanism. It is quick and easy and holds well.The leather is a nice quality, the belt is thick, and the stitching is neat.I received this belt from Marino Avenue for evaluation and review.Ali Julia review"

I have a lot of experience in removing links from dress watches and the common demise for the link removal tools is a bent pin. This kit includes three spare pins. They are very welcomed but I wish the kit included a minimum of 10 of these pins. For each watch I typically remove 2 links, which means I need to push out 4 pins and then insert 2 using this tool.The link remover tool is similar to my old link removers but the platform does not gets raised as high. This is needed for thinner bands (typically in women's watches). It just worked for my ladies watch with a ceramic band (it is a little thicker) but if the band was any thinner it would not line up correctly. My old tool can be raised higher. The band on men's watches are typically thicker and this tool worked on all bands I checked.The link removal tool works for bands that are 7/8&#34; wide or less. The width of the tool is not adjustable. I was not able to use this tool with a band that is 15/16&#34; wide, as that band was just a little too wide to lay flat in the tool.In attached video I show how this tool kit works with three different watches:1. A ladies watch with a ceramic band and a round face (fits perfectly)2. A men's watch with wide band and a square face (too wide to fit into the tool)3. A man's watch with a round face (used to show the back removal tool)The adjustable case opener platform and wrench are solidly made. The rubber tips/teeth of the wrench have to fit into the rivets in the back of the watch. When you rotate counter clock wise it opens the case, when you turn clockwise it closes the case. The maximum distance between the rubber points is 32.63mm as measured with my digital caliper. This distance varies based on the size of the watch, and some of husbands watches are too large by a few millimetres and this wrench does not work on them. So measure the distance between the rivets before ordering this kit to be sure it will do the job.The anti-magnetic screwdrivers do not have a Phillips head. The watch I am opening in the video required a Phillips head screwdriver and I had to use another screwdriver to do this part of the job. The watch back pry opening worked very well, it made it easy to open and remove the back.A kit includes a large set of springs of different sizes. All springs are one piece springs, my ceramic band watch has springs with heads and this kit did not include this type of springs. In the video I use my own spring of this type.Stainless Steel Tweezers with bent tips are very good, they have long handles and very thin tips. The tweezers are easy to control.The small hammer worked very well for putting in the caps on my capped springs for the ceramic band. I would not have been able to do it without it.Here is the list of everything in the package:1 x Case Holder;1 x FREE Hammer;1 x Watch Case Holder(for watch case 10-45mm diameter18 x Adjustable Case Opener Pins1 x Stainless Steel Tweezers1 x Spring Bar Tool2 x Spring Bar Tool Spare Tips108 x Watch Strap Spring pins1 x Link Remover3 x Link Remover Spare Pins1 x Watch back pry opener (with yellow ergo handle)3 x Precision Anti-magnetic Screwdrivers (1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm)What I would have liked to see different? Many more link tool spare tips and a tiny Phillips screwdriver.

I like how it looks and fits into my decor. It is not perfect (as I will describe below) but its looks overcome the minor issues. This is a very solidly build toilet paper holder. The supports are made from solid brass and are very heavy (each one is 8.9 oz).So what are the issues? First, the big rolls I get at Costo do not roll smoothly at the very beginning of the roll when it is full. The supports catch on the jumbo roll a bit and you need to use your hand to help it along. This does not last long.Second, each of the supports has a logo so they don't look as nice if they were just plain chrome. The supports are designed to be mounted with a logo up and a small hole for a screw down. I decided to mount the supports with the logo down and screw hole up and my video includes how this looks so you can decide if this looks ok to you.The package includes mounting hardware and an Allen wrench but no documentation or mounting template. The mounting process had a couple of tricky moments.The supports are shipped with a mounting bracket inside the support. Pay careful attention in how they are positioned in the support. The first time I mounted I did it wrong, the smooth surface goes towards the fall, not facing out. The support is removed/secured by using an included Allen wrench. The supports are designed with the hole to be facing down. The hole is very close to a wall, so you can only rotate the Allen space about 1/4 turn because the Allen wrench hits the wall. I have a bad back so working the hole from below was very painful for me and mounted the hole facing up. It made it much easier to mount and tighten up when needed. In attached video you see how I did it, it is a decision to compensate for my bad back and I assume most people would mount the support facing down.The package does not include a mounting template, and to place the holes correctly I made one of my own. This helped me align the two unconnected supports. The drill bit that fits the hollow wall anchors is 7/32&quot;.Even though I think the packaging could have been better, I am very pleased with the way it looks and the solidness of the construction.This toilet holder is provided by Orca for testing and review.

A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,Ali Julia,http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B01149QVWQ,Cat Window Seat SmartSpeed&reg; Window Mounted Cat Bed with Suction Cup,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01149QVWQ,SmartSpeed Tech.,$23.99,Pet Supplies,"October 18, 2015",5,Both of our cats like it,"See video on Amazon.com I want to start with a few words about the construction of the seat. The suction cups are LARGE (3.25&#34;), so they provide a secure hold. The string that holds the seat is made out of twisted metal wires, like a heavy duty picture frame hanging wire, so that is also very secure even if the kitty runs its claws over it. The seat is made out of canvas bag with a waterproof lining inside the bag. The top material has a feel of canvas (it is not plush). The plastic tubes are hollow this provides structural strength. So I believe it can hold a couple of heavy cats. Our kitty cats are pretty small (7 and 8 pounds) so it sure holds them well. In attached video you see them rubbing against the wires supports and pulling on them with their paws, we held our breath watching them but the shelf held without a problem. The shelve has been up for more than 2 weeks with the cats going up and down and we did not need to readjust or reattach it.Assembly was easy. The plastic parts push together to form a frame. The canvas bag is pulled over the frame. The canvas seat has two small holes through which you need to feed the wires that to to the top suction cups. As the cats sit on the shelve it does not remain taught, it kind of sags in the middle forming a nest.I have to say that our kitties did not take to the shelf right away. They did not like the texture of the canvas. We fixed that by putting a towel over it as we know our cats love any towel. With the towel in place they had an initial fear of the seat, but we enticed them to try it out by placing a couple of Greenies in the middle of the shelf. Our kitties love Greenies so they went for it. Once they were on the shelf they realized it was a pretty good place to be. By the next day they did not need any enticement, and we see our cats taking turns sleeping there as well as looking out of the window. We put the window seat on the windows across from our bird feeders as our indoor cats often look at the birds through the windows.The seat comes without assembly instructions. My video include the major steps1) putting together the frame of the seat2) threading the wires through the seat3) inserting anchors into the suction cups4) attaching the seat to the windowThis shelf was provided to our feline testers for review. Once they got over their initial fear they like it and told me to give it a 5 star rating. We see them on the shelf quite often, mostly sleeping rather than gazing out of the window, but they like it.Ali Julia review"

Frankly, I underestimated how large 14&quot; bag is, it is a bit larger than I expected.What I like most about this bag is that it has three compartments: the central large zipped compartment and to equally large compartments on the sides. In addition to three main compartments there are 3 pockets on the inside (one zipped) and one zipped pocket on the outside. Somehow I always manage to have a lot of stuff in my purse and this bag really keeps all the things well organized.' The purse 14&quot; x 13.5&quot; x 4.4&quot;' The purse has handles that are large enough for me to put over my shoulder (even without a shoulder strap) - they have 7&quot; clearance from the purse to the top.' The purse also includes an adjustable shoulder strap which can be extended to max of 46&quot;.The inside lining is deep brown. This is very practical because it does not show dirt and will look good for a long time. On the outside the bag is faux leather. One side is plain, the other one has a design.This purse is provided by Scarleton for review as part of a new product introduction. Overall, it is a very large very roomy bag.

I tested each USB port with a current monitor and several of my mobile devices. Both USB ports provided optimal charge for my Android and Apple devices. This charge uses smart chip which detects attached devices and self-adjust its output to the required charging voltage and current and allow a faster charging time. Attached photos show my tests with a current monitor which show the current and voltage on both ports. Its good for both devices I am showing in the photos.Each individual port and USB ports have an individual on/off switch. When USB ports are on there is a blue LED indicator next to them. When AC ports are on there is no light to indicate that they are on, one has to look at the state of the button (depressed or not) to see if the AC port is turned on. I would have preferred a small LED for each port.This power strip has been in use for a couple of week, it does not get hot, no sparks, all is working well.

They were too large for me (I normally wear small size). They fit my husband better. Initially he thought the fingers were a bit too tight for comfort and the palm was a little too wide. However, after using them for shucking oysters my husband said they became more comfortable and molded themselves to his fingers and the tightness in the fingers was no longer a problem. The gloves gave him a great grip and made him less worried about cutting himself. He was able to apply more pressure. The bottom line was that he never shucked oysters as fast as he did with these gloves on. He actually wore just one glove, on the hand that held the oyster, he held the oyster knife with his bare hand.To illustrate the fit I show how the gloves fits my hand as well as on 1&#34; grid for size reference. And here are some additional measurements.The middle finger is 3.25&#34;The total glove length is 9.5&#34;The width of the palm is 4.25&#34; unstretchedNote that cut resistant gloves should not be too tight, when they are tight the fibers have less cut resistance.The gloves are symmetrical - by that I mean there is no left or right. Since my husband only needs one glove for shucking we are keeping one in the kitchen at home and one in the car along with the oyster knife as one can often get great fresh oysters along New England coast line.The only negative I can say about the gloves that all packaging is in Chinese, so we did not know the best way to clean the gloves. I looked up instructions on the internet and it appears that cut gloves are cleaned by washing with soap and water.

My current monitor showed that my iPad Mini draws 0.93A (typical for 1A but below optimal for Apple devices). My Android phone draw 0.94A which is close optimal for Android devices.

I did not give this missing feature much significance until I handed the wallet to my husband. He said that cops give a woman more time to fumble in her purse to get the license but if a guy fumbles for an id it might be considered a delay tactic.

This hose almost got me there I was close enough that the I could reach area with a spray. In my rough measurement the hose is slightly under 100 feet so of the shortage could be accounted by the fact that hose does not lay totally straight. I like that this hose has brass connectors, I get better leak free connections than with plastic. The package includes a spray nozzle with 8 pattern. I show all patterns in the video. The connector that goes from the hose to the sprayer has a shut off valve.I have been using expandable hoses for several seasons. The best thing about these hoses are how easy they are to work with. They are light and when they have no water they are much shorter and easier to store. The worst thing about them is that they are fairly fragile and don't last a long time. They easily burst and develop leaks. Do not expect them to last as long as a regular garden hose. Through experience I learned a few tips that help me make them last more than one season.I take the following precautions:1. When I store the hose I store in a bucket or tub. I make sure there it has no pressure on any part of the hose. I do not hang it, because this where the leaks developed in my first hose.2. Before storing it I drain it completely. It is easy because all I have to is lift when it shrinks, it is very light3. When I use the hose I do not put the water pressure all the way up, I open the faucet at about half force (my water pressure is quite strong).4. When I use it I make sure I don't step on it and it does not tangle on anything. I lay it out straight toward the area that I need to water.5. To make better connections I use teflon tape on every connection.Yeah, it is a lot of extra care but I really like that it is so light which makes it easier on my bad back.This hose is provided by Newzon.Ali Julia review"

At the time when I am writing this review the watch is just under $40. Despite the price is looks quite elegant and works well. This is a mechanical watch so it requires daily winding. It auto winds just from the action of the hand but the manual indicates that this is not enough to prevent the need for daily winding. To test how long one winding of the watch lasts my husband gave it a good long wind on Sunday morning and noticed that it stopped at 7:10 am on Tuesday morning. So daily winding gives it a margin of error so you don't have to wind it at exactly the same time each day.The watch comes with a manual, it covers two watches neither one of them matches the dial of this watch. The crown itself has three positions. Position one is normal operation. Position three allows one to adjust time by turning clockwise or counter clockwise. Position two adjust day (counter clockwise turning) and date (clockwise turning). The button above and below the crown adjust the small dials. The button above the crown adjusts the day, the button below the crown adjusts the date.The case is made out of stainless steel which is gold colored. If there is anything negative to say about the watch it is the contrast between the gold and the black. The contrast is not as good as the gold hands/numbers and the white face or the silver hands/numbers and the black face, so under some lightening condition reading the time is not ideal.The watch weighs 2.4 oz. The width of the face is 1.6&#34; and its thickness is 0.6&#34;. The wrist band is 8.5&#34; from the last hole to the buckle. The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing, but cannot be submerged under water.Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch. Given the price of many mechanical watches this watch is a good deal. My husband has been wearing it for 2 weeks checking its accuracy against his smart phone - it keeps rasonably accurate time (within 2 minutes) as long as he remembers to wind it.This watch is provided by KS for testing and review.Ali Julia review"

However it is about $15 cheaper than the a similar camera with WIFI and larger number of clips as the time I am writing this review.Coplux video quality is reasonably good and it has an simple menu driven interface that is easy to use. The video is somewhat overexposed in very bright sun. It is acceptable when it is totally dark (for example used a night time dash cam) although not as good as my full size camera. The camera is exactly the same size as GoPro camera. It fits all accessories built for GoPro. I have a drone which has a gimbal designed to work with GoPro and this camera fits into this gimbal as if it was built for it! I picked out this camera because it has a bright yellow front, which makes it easy to see if the camera is positioned correctly when it is up in the air.

My skin absorbs it quickly, and even though I have a pretty sensitive skin I had no irritation (it has been almost two weeks since I began using it).The bottle contains 1 fl oz, so it is not large. The fact that dispenser produces small gobs when the pump is pressed is helpful to make it last. Suggested use it to apply it daily. I have been using it on my face around the eyes and above the eye brows. It is very good at controlling the dryness I get above my eyebrows. I can't say that I see noticeable wrinkle reduction, but it definitely takes care of the dry skin in my trouble spots.IngredientsDeionized Water, Witch Hazel Extract, Glycerol Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Shea Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, PEG-8, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, PPG-12 SMDI/Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Peppermint Oil, Green Tea Extract, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate.I received a sample bottle for testing and review.Ali Julia review"

The book contains interesting comparison between Jewish and Chinese cooking, and has a section explaining Kosher cooking, but it is not aimed at Jewish or Kosher cooks only. The authors goal is to make Chinese cooking easy. Even though they are not required the author recommends using two special Chinese cooking tools as a convenience - a wok and a Chinese vegetable knife. For Kosher cooks there is a short section for recommended meat substitutions (to replace pork in the recipes).The recipes are simple and tasty. I never realized how simple it is to make Szechuan Noodles that taste like real restaurant quality Szechuan Noodles! So far my favorite recipe has been tea-smoked duck breast. It is similar to Peking Duck and I never imagined I would be able to make it at home.A little about the book organization. My favorite cookbooks manage to keep the recipes on one page, if the recipe takes two pages it is put on the opposite sides of the page so I don't have to turn pages while my hands are covered with food stuff. I also like seeing a photo of the prepared dish next to the recipe. This book does not do either of these. Most recipes require a page flip, and it has no photos at all.I received a review copy of this book and enjoyed trying out different recipes to share my experience with other reader.Ali Julia review"

It has pluses and minuses and I will describe them both.This small speaker is targeted to a Chinese market - it has a large number of voice prompts in Chinese. The manual is in Chinese, the package includes two sheets of paper with English instruction which explain the the first two prompts: Bluetooth ready and Bluetooth connected. The speaker has other prompts but they are not translated.The Bluetooth connection took several times to connect properly. The first time I got only once voice prompt although the Bluetooth status indicated that the speaker was connected. When the music did not stream through the speaker, I removed the connection, power cycled it, and connected again. Then I heard two voice prompts and it began working. The blue-tooth device is called BT-Speaker.How did it sound? The speaker sounds best with human voice (I am using to stream Navigation instructions). The speaker did not do as well with music. To help me evaluate and compare different speakers I always use the same pieces of music to test the speakers. This way I can compare the speakers using this &quot;apples-to-apples&quot; comparison. As a stress test for the bass I use Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The speaker could not handle it without distortions. The speaker cannot be made very loud, it was only slightly louder and better than the internal speaker of my phone.This speaker also can work as an MP3 player and stream music from a micro SD card. In attached video I include a snippet of stream music from my phone and another one streaming from a micro sd card.The buttons on the speaker are hard to read. The icons are blue on blue, and there is a Chinese character next to the icon so I could not really make out symbols for operations. I just tried each button to figure out what they do. On/Off is the second button from the bottom. Volume controls is the top button (down) and the bottom button (up).What I like most about this speaker is a big loop which allows me to hang the speaker in the car using a carabiner (included in the package).Overall, I can't say this is a great speaker. The best feature for me is the loop because I use to hang the speaker in the car to stream Navigation system instructions. For music this is not the best choice out there.Ali Julia review"

This makes it easy to weight large boxes that would cover the display attached to the platform.The only thing I don't like about the scale is its precision for ounces. It rounds. So instead of showing 9.1 oz it would show 9 oz. Instead of 10.7 oz it would show 11 oz. When I send packages I like to know how close I am to the full number just in case my scale is not as accurate as the scale at the post office. On the positive side, I verified that it rounds correctly at a number of different weights by measuring an item on a more precise scale first and then on this one.This scale can run either on two on 9V battery or plugged into a USB port. I like that it runs from a USB outlet rather than AC because I can run it off an external battery and don't need to place the battery near an AC outlet. One 9V battery is included.I tested this scale with my old scale which has been calibrated. Both scales agreed. I also tested how well balanced it the platform by placing the same item in different places on the scale - all results were the same. Excellent. I have seen scales that show different results when the item is placed at 4 corners of the platform, but this scale showed the same results no matter where I placed the item.There are several buttons that control this scale's operation. Mode changes the measure of units. Tare button allows you to subtract the weight of the container. The third button is hold, it freezes the weight on the display even when you remove the item from the scale.Bottom line: nice scale, but not precise if you need to know fractional ounces.This scale is provided by SmartWeigh.Ali Julia review"

This does not happen in a typical headlamps which have a light that can be ratcheted down because the casing shields the light from the eyes.

This flashlight runs on four AAA batteries not four AA batteries as stated in the description.The second discrepancy is that the description states that the light has a magnetized base, however my flashlight does not have a magnetized base. Maybe I got a defective one, but I cannot make it stick to the car (as shown in a stock photo) or any other metal.Update October 30, 2015: I did have a defective unit. The vendor noticed that in my video the magnet that was supposed to be attached to the bottom of the flashlight was missing. He sent me a replacement and the replacement light does stick to metal. The magnet looks like a silver coin attached next to the hook on the bottom the flashlight.However, the light has a number of strong points and overall I like it. The strong point of this light that it can work in many different positions. It can stand on one end, and the light angle can be changed in 180 degree arc. The light also has a built-in hook, so the light can be hung. The hook is not heavy duty but it works fine to hold the light. The light source can be either the two double LEDs on the head of the light or the light panel on the side of the light. You cannot turn on both at the same time.The entire length of the light and the clip is 7.5&quot;. Its weight is 6.3 oz.The panel with 14 LED light is 2.5&quot;To provide an unbiased evaluation of the lights's brightness I used a lux meter.The CREE light measured at 2180 lux at 12 inchesThe light from the LED panel measured 264 lux at 12 inchesFor comparison, a 60 watt fluorescent bulb at the same distance produces 1119 lux.I am finding this light very handy in the basement, where I need to do chores like changing air filters in odd dark corners. Nice to have a light that is so flexible.I was provided a sample for testing and review. Getting a free sample does not effect what I say. I included the positives and the negatives of my experience.

By comparison Zitriom is a thinner packing tape, but is much cheaper ($5.99 and qualifies for free shipping as I write this review) . The thinner tape is a little harder to work with because it curls where as the thick packing tape like Scotch tape remains stiff after you cut it. Zitriom tape is very sticky and adheres well to the packages and envelopes.The package include the tape dispenser. There are two ways the tape can be dispense from the dispenser, with the tape coming from the opposite side of the orange handle or over the orange handle. I found that I get a cleaner neater cut when the tape comes from the opposite side of the orange handle.I received this tape from Zitriom with a request to test and review this tape and share my experience as part of a new product introduction.Ali Julia review"

I rank my overall experience as good (i.e. pleased overall, but it does have some weak points). The strongest point points of this table is the high resolution screen (1920 x 1200 resolution). I can fit a lot on the screen while maintaining clarity. I set the font to large to make it easier to see the text. The weakest points are battery life, WI FI performance and the speaker.In some low cost tablets the total memory is divided into two partitions restricting the amount of memory available for installing apps. I was happy to see that it is not the case with this tablet. I show the storage layout in my video, where this restriction appears if it exists. I show th storage after I installed about a dozen of the applications that I use all the time.WI FI performance is not stellar. To test its wireless capabilities I run OOKLA speed test app. I ran the test 5 times and then repeated the test on my Samsung tablet. The old Samsung tablet performed significantly better. Chuwi tablet results ranged from 14 Mbps to 27 Mbps for download, and 10 Mbps to 19 Mbps for upload speed. By comparison, my Samsung tablet did 37.88 Mbps download and 33.67 Mbps upload.Some budget tablets do not support bluetooth functionality. Chuwi tablet does support bluetooth. I am using a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth keyboard with it, both work smoothly. In attached video I show pairing and using the bluetooth speaker.The tablet is running Android 4.4.4 (Kit kat) operating system. I tested many of my favorte apps and so far have not found any that did not work. Here are example of the apps I am using on on Chuwi tablet: Battery widget, OOKLA speedtest, Tune-in Radio, iHeart radio, Nexflix, Firefox, YouTube, OI notepad, OI file manager, iPerf, OTG disk Explorer, Dropbox, Kindle, camera. I also tried a few of my favorite games and they all work.This tablet also supports Windows 10. By default is starts as an Android tablet and under settings there is an options to &#34;Switch OS&#34;. Windows comes up in a minute or two. To return back to Android OS there is an Android icon on the tool bar.I found the touch screen to be very responsive. Using on-screen keyboard generates good feedback.The built-in speaker is not great and cannot be made very loud. However, because the tablet has bluebooth capabilities when I want to make it loud I use a bluetooth speaker.The battery life on the tablet is less than the other tablets I own. I can run my iPad Mini or Samsung tablets for more than I day without recharging. This tablet needs to be recharged every day even when it is not used constantly.The tablet has an uncommon size (8 2/8&#34; long and 4 7/8&#34; wide). I am yet to find a case that fits it well.Bottom line? A pretty a decent tablet. In attached video I included a variety of short snippets of running various apps such as Netflix, Tune in radio, Pandora and others.This tablet is provided by Chuwi for testing and review as part of the new product introduction.

Asian sizes are different from American sizes (typically two sizes smaller) and not all sellers make it clear if the drop down list with sizes shows American or Asian sizes. Do not use the link to the chart size at the top of the listing. The seller included Sizing table in the product description.

It really does not work well because when I carry the bag it is cockeyed especially if it is loaded. It does have a strap that allows one to carry it straight over the shoulder, the the long strap is attached in a way that the bag hangs straight. The shoulder strap is 43&quot; long and adjustable. But I found the short handle very awkward.The bag is large and has one large compartment. It is 13.5&quot; tall and 17.5&quot; wide. The inside of the bag has one small zipped side pocket, and two open side pockets. The lining is dark brown and practical as it does not show dirt.The decoration on the side are metal rivets that rattle as I move the bag. The description calls them &quot;magnetic nails&quot;. They are metal so the react to a magnet, but they are not magnetic themselves. They do not attract a metal pin that tested them with. This is a &quot;don't care&quot; feature for me, but if someone actually has a use for a magnets on the outside of the purse I wanted to mention that they are not magnets.If not for the odd handle I would find it to be a nice errands bag, with an odd handle I rate it as OK bag.This handbag is provided by YOUNA.Ali Julia review"

I was impressed that it gets fairly decent reception.The iRonsnow unit in addition to being a radio with FM/AM/WB bands also a flash light and can serve as an external power bank for brief charging of a cell phone (i.e. it will not fully recharge it, but will give it enough juice to make an emergency phone call it chargers at a slow USB rate).The radio is 6&#34; x 2 7/8&#34; x 1 3/4&#34;, its weight is 10.9 oz.It is water resistant and can be used in the rain or in a water craft, but it should not be submerged in water. Maintenance recommendation from the manufacture is to crank the handle for a few moments and turn on the flashlight for 5 seconds every 60 to 90 days if the unit is stored without use for several months. Manufacture states that battery life expectancy is more than 3 years and more than 5000 charging cycles (with 3 hours of daily use).Overall, I am impressed with the radio reception I got.The radio also provides two sources of light. The side lamp and the top panel. Neither one is very bright, but they provide some light in an emergency situation. To quantify what I mean by not very bright I used a lux meter which measures the light intensity. The top panel provided 5.6 lux at 12 inches, the side lamp provided 73 lux at 12 inches. For comparison a 60 watt fluorescent bulb at the same distance of 12&#34; produces a reading of 1110 lux.Cranking is not hard, and true to advertising 1 minute of cranking gave me about 20 minutes of light. I am feeling better prepared for the next long power outage at least I will have AM, FM, and weather band to keep me informed.

I use MP3 player for music and audio books. Not every MP3 player can handle audio books because audio books require that that the MP3 either has bookmarks or start exactly where it left last time. RUIZU is not capable of bookmarking and it does not remember where it left off last time, so it is not well suited for audio books. However, it does quite well with music.

Bags are still useable with a vaccum cleaner hose.,"See video on Amazon.com I always use each product I review for several weeks to see how they work with continuous use. My initial impression of these vacuum bags was very good, and I really liked the little pump. However, the pump broke after several uses. The gasket on inside of the pump got ripped and it can no longer generate vacuum. I can still use my vacuum hose to evacuate the air so the bags are usable, but the pump is not. One of the things that attracted me to this item was the pump, so it is disappointing to see that it did not last.After the first use I thought I was going to rate this product as 5 star product, unfortunately my initial impression is downgraded to ok 3 star. The bags are still very good, but the pump is not well made and 3 star is average between the parts of the listing.This is the review I wrote before the pump broke:I use vacuum bags to store seasonal clothing. Between the two types of bags (compression bags and vacuum storage bags) I prefer the vacuum bags. Compression bags are the kind you need to roll up to extract air, vacuum bags get the air evaluated with an aid of the vacuum. Before this particular set of bags I always used a hose from an electric vacuum to get the air out, this set comes with a pump. Which means the biggest obstacle using vacuum bags when travelling is removed. The enclosed vacuum pump is small and light. It is constructed to fit the opening of the bag. In attached video you see how it works. There was one pleasant surprise. After I pumped out the air from the bag (took about 160 pumps) I thought a lot of air would rush back in between the time I removed the pump and put the cap on, however the vacuum port is constructed in such a way that no air got in at all!This set contains 6 bags, 6 clips to close the bag opening, and 1 pump. To unseal the bag all I do is pull the edge apart. I am very please with the set. If there was one thing I would have wanted to change it would be to have a couple of extra clips. I tend to lose them over the years. The bags last me many seasons, but the problem is that I tend to lose the clips and this means I cannot reseal the bag again.These bags are provided by Eco Green.

The drive carriers are completely toolless, no screws are required. The case has eight removable drive bays that make adding hard drives very simple, all you have to do is slide out the carrier, insert the drive, attach the SATA and power cable to the drive and then slide it back in. To further simplify the insertion of drives the drive bays face the opening of the case rather than the interior.The case is very roomy which simplifies access to the motherboard and the PCIe slots. Cooling is excellent, featuring two front fans to cool the disk drives, a 140mm top fan and a rear fan. A second top fan and a bottom fan may be added if needed although the standard fans will be sufficient for almost all applications. The fans are nearly silent.The power supply bay is at the bottom of the case which makes the case stable.The front panel has 4 USB ports. Having a large number of USB ports on the front panel is a plus for me, as our computers are stored on shelves and the top is less accessible because it is above my line of site.The case has removable air filters so they can be cleaned easily. I normally use a hand held vacuum to clear vents, a removable filter is going to make this chore easier.The construction feels very sturdy and yet the case is fairly light.Overall case dimensions are 19&#34;H (include 1&#34; feet) x 8.5W&#34; x 20.5&#34; front to back.A note on the aesthetics of the computer case. The black pebbled finish gives the case a retro look, very reminiscent of WWII electronic equipment. My husband is a history buff and he loved the finish of this case for its retro look.The case opens with two thumbscrews, the panels are easy to slide in and align. Hard drives are easy to replace.

Loudspeaker output is 5W. To help me evaluate and compare different speakers I always use the same pieces of music to test the speakers. This way I can compare the speakers using this &#34;apples-to-apples&#34; comparison. As a stress test for the bass I use Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor.

Day time video is very good, it does well even in the very sunny situations and does not overexpose. The video during the night under very low light conditions was acceptable. Live video works well. Menu-based interface is well organized and easy to use. The documention is quite good and has a lot of details. The camera comes with a large variety of accessories, including a suction window mount, waterproof camera, and a remote control. I was very pleased for several days.However, after a few days of usage the camera crashed and was stuck on the first screen (I could not turn it off or proceed to the next screen). I &#34;fixed&#34; it by removing and then reinserting the battery. Initially, I thought this fixed the problem as the camera recorded for another 30-40 minutes. But when I got home I saw that after the crash all recordings were in slow motion. I fully recharged the batteries and tried a few more recordings. They were all in slow motions. I went through all the menus and contacted the manufacturer. The manufacturer was responsive and provided me a software update to install on the camera. However the download is very large and needs to be downloaded from a Chinese site. I have attempted to do this download many times, some of the downloads failed others reported success but unzip utility failed reporting a corrupted zip file. I have not been able to test if the upgrade resolved the problem or not.In attached video you see examples from the videos before and after the crash. Note that Amazon compresses video so this degrade the video quality in the clip.Here are my notes from set up:1. The name of the camera hot spot is &#34;amba-boss&#34;.The password you need to enter to connect to the hot spot is included in documentation.To put the camera into WIFI mode you need to press the right most button on the top of the camera.2. The name of the app is &#34;LinkinEyes&#34;. This app shows live action from the camera, as well as allows to change camera configuration.In my video I show live video. It looks good! The delay between the action and display is minimal, it is better than another small camera I have with live video capability.CamPark supports micro SD cards up to 32GB, Class 10 is recommended (the micro SD card is not included).It runs on 900mAH and I get slightly over an hour on one charge. To recharge the camera takes about 2 hours from empty. For the fastest charging the camera should be turned off when charging, however it can record while charging if desired.I received this camera for evaluation and review as part of a new product introduction.

It also calculates the energy (Watt per hour) automatically, saving me from having to do the multiplication. It shows the temperature of the device it is measuring, which is useful as higher than normal temperature indicate problems.

It appears to be reasonably accurate. It can measure current up to 5.1A.Is it totally perfect? No. My old current monitor has a cord, so I can always twist the cord to turn the display in a way that is easy to read. This monitor does not have a cord and sometimes the display is upside down or away from me. I need to turn the appliance I am measuring to see the reading. The display has a lot of information and is written in a small font which is not always easy to read. It comes with a manual which describes the basic functionality well. The manual is written in a microscopic font, and I had to pull out my reading glasses as my eyes were straining reading it.
